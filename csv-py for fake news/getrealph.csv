"Philippines Dangerously Playing With Fire? U.S. Nuclear Missiles, Russian Attack Submarine and China ICBMs All In Play",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/12/philippines-dangerously-playing-with-fire-u-s-nuclear-missiles-russian-attack-submarine-and-china-icbms-all-in-play/,"The Philippines is making dangerous moves. After Manila allowed the US to increase its military bases all over the country, it is now in the middle of a geopolitical tinderbox.
With the U.S. stationing its NUCLEAR-capable Typhon missile system in the Philippines, and a Russian attack submarine recently spotted lurking in the West Philippine Sea and China testing more intercontinental missiles that flies over the Philippines in response to US military expansion in Southeast Asia.
While allies like Japan and Australia claim to support the Philippines the rest of ASEAN is keeping its distance, sticking to a neutral stance in the escalating U.S.-China showdown. So, where does this leave us?
U.S. Typhon Missile System: A Deadly Presence
Earlier this year, the U.S. deployed its nuclear-capable Typhon missile system in Northern Luzon as part of joint military exercises. Military officials initially said the missiles were only in the country on a temporary basis but here’s the kicker: the system now has no plans of leaving. DND Secretary Teodoro even asserted the country’s right to acquire the missile system, which would give the Philippines the capability to hit targets inside China, including Taiwan.
Capable of carrying nuclear warheads and firing precision-guided missiles like the Tomahawk, this isn’t just a defense tool; it’s a game-changer in regional military balance. The U.S. claims it’s to strengthen the Philippines’ defenses, but let’s be real—this puts us squarely in China’s cross hairs.
China’s reaction? Furious. Beijing has accused the Philippines and the U.S. of destabilizing the region. And they’re not bluffing— just last September, China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, flying over the northern point of the Philippines in what is reported to be the first such test since the 1980s. Are we ready to handle the fallout if China decides to play hardball?
Russian Attack Submarine in West Philippine Sea
If hosting advanced U.S. missiles wasn’t enough, last week brought another jaw-dropping moment: a Russian attack submarine was detected within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. The submarine was found just 80 nautical miles off Mindoro. President Marcos called the incident “very worrisome,” and honestly, he’s not wrong. Unauthorized foreign military activity in our waters raises a terrifying question: are we becoming a battleground for global powers?
Ukraine saw the worst of being a proxy in the US-Russia with over 500,000 dead and counting.
Dangerously Provoking the Superpowers
Let’s talk about money—because this isn’t just about security; it’s about survival. China is our biggest trading partner and neighbor, with billions of pesos worth of goods flowing between us. But by aligning closely with the Washington, we risk alienating Beijing.
What if China slaps us with sanctions, cuts back on trade and investments or ignores the Philippines all together in its regional economic plans? That’s a direct hit to Filipino job seekers, consumers and businessmen.
And let’s not forget: military alliances cost money. Acquiring advanced weapons and hosting U.S. troops means pouring billions into defense, potentially at the expense of social services. Can we afford this gamble?
Is the Philippines Losing ASEAN’s Trust?
While we’re cozying up to the U.S., our ASEAN neighbors are keeping things cool. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia are refusing to take sides, focusing on economic growth and peace. By openly following the US military alliance, we risk losing our influence in ASEAN, a bloc that’s crucial for regional stability and economic growth. Are we okay with being seen as the pariah in the region?
The Philippines is playing a dangerous game. Hosting U.S. missiles, dealing with Russian attack submarines and China’s ICBM might look like power moves, but they come with risks that could hit Filipinos where it hurts—our economy, our sovereignty, and our regional relationships.
So, where do we go from here? Do we double down on our alliance with the U.S. and hope for the best, or do we step back and reassess before the storm hits? One thing’s for sure: the stakes have never been higher, and the consequences could shape our future for generations. Are we ready for what’s coming?",Politics
Assassination attempt on Donald Trump: illiberal means to “save democracy”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump-illiberal-means-to-save-democracy/,"Quite confronting that an assassination attempt on a former American president and the Republican candidate in the coming presidential election in the United States could still happen in this day and age. Following shots fired during former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania resulted in the deaths of a member of the audience and the shooter. A seemingly bloodied Trump was seen on video being whisked away by Secret Service personnel. He was reportedly injured in the attack on the “upper part of [his] right ear”. Two other audience member were also reportedly critically injured.
The Secret Service said the shooter fired multiple shots from an “elevated position” outside of the Trump rally before he was killed by agents. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination, according to law enforcement officials.
As expected, content rolled off social media filled with both support for and vitriol against Trump. The campaign of current US President Joe Biden exhibited grace. Reuters reports…
US President Joe Biden said he was briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump’s rally and that he was ‘grateful to hear that he’s safe and doing well. I’m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information’
It does not take a political “expert” to issue an educated guess on how liberals are feeling in the aftermath.
Before all this, it is widely known that the liberal establishment had been mounting a well-funded concerted effort to stop Trump. Noted thought leader Fareed Zakaria in a March op-ed piece published on the Washington Post warned them about going overboard in their quest to “save democracy”…
Liberal democracies should avoid the temptation of using illiberal means, even when they confront views and positions that are forthrightly hostile toward liberal democracy itself. I worry about some of the court cases against Trump. While they might be technically legitimate, some involve offenses that happened years ago and for which he was not charged at the time. Would he have been charged for these were he not the controversial political figure he is today?
Indeed, of the “excesses” of the left, Zakaria further writes, “[they] want to ban those who have ‘wrong’ ideas from speaking. They want to achieve racial equality by quota or decree. They want to use education or art to achieve political goals rather than educational or artistic ones.”
As this is a developing story, it is, of course, prudent to refrain from any further speculation as the investigation on this breaking incident progresses.",Politics
Similarities between Pinoy Culture and Wokeness,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/similarities-pinoyculture-wokeness/,"After examining the Woke phenomenon, I saw parallels between it and some Pinoy attitudes, especially the Pinoy Pride attitude. Get Real Philippines’ main theme for years is that the reason for the Philippines’ backwardness is its culture, and if some parts of the culture are similar to Wokeness, then no wonder. These are the similarities I observed:
1. Victim Mentality
I would call it “Pretend Kawawaness” as well. People can claim to be oppressed or victims when they actually are not. Wokeness is a claim by some people that they have special awareness of how oppression actually works (they are “woke” or “awake” so they could see it, others could not). They even claim that a person can commit oppression without realizing it, and it’s the Woke person’s job to detect and “correct” that. Some Woke people also claim to be oppressed themselves. Marxism, one of Woke’s sources, claims that being oppressed opens one to special knowledge, and this makes the connection of Marxism to Gnosticism not farfetched. Both Marxism and Woke propose having the “oppressed” overthrow the existing leaders to become the leaders themselves.
Filipinos at times do say they’re oppressed when they don’t get the hand-outs they want. I’ve also written about how Filipinos embrace brokenness as an identity and tend to refuse to be “fixed,” which is like Woke. They both use the image of “brokenness” to get what they want (pretend to be poor or poverty porn to get hand-outs). In Woke’s case, they use this image to get not only hand-outs but also power. Once given enough power, they would want their brokenness to become imposed on other people. The result will predictably be the breaking of the world, although this is after all the goal of Woke’s originators.
Another mindset that both Wokes and Pinoys share is that they see someone who is in a more comfortable state because of their own achievements as selfish and evil. So they believe that such people are oppressive and should be forced to hand out to those who were unable to have the same achievements (i.e., those who refuse to work and want to mooch). If they refuse, they should be brought down. They would explain that being superior in some traits or even just being different is oppression of someone else. This is a twisted understanding of reality and is also envy in operation.
2. Claiming to be “special”
“Woke” already has that concept of being special. Similarly, Filipinos like to think they are a “special people,” and the Filipino identity should draw special treatment, deference, adulations, and more from the rest of the world despite the lack of any tangible achievement. Add to that the tendency to ride on others’ achievements, such as saying we’re a great people when athletes like Carlos Yulo and Hidilyn Diaz earn medals. That traps Filipinos in a cycle wherein they refuse to take reasonable actions and steps to improve their condition.
Woke and Pinoy Pride are also similar in being prideful. While our pridefulness is in part a result of vanity-encouraging marketing, our own culture and even some government-sponsored “Pinoy Pride” initiatives also encourage Filipino self-projecting. Filipinos likely believe they need to project pride as a proof of life and as a way of coping with their relative poverty and desperation. However, this only highlights intellectual bankruptcy.
3. Opposition to Western Culture
Both Woke and some Pinoys like to blame Western colonialism and culture for their problems. The West is seen as an evil that invades “pure” societies and corrupts them, even if many life-saving advancements and improvements were actually provided by it. Anti-American sentiment isn’t new these days, I’ve seen how Filipinos displayed anti-English sentiments at the time I was a child. “Being Patriotic” for such Pinoys meant making an enemy of other countries and cultures even if they actually benefit from these.
Both Woke and Pinoy Pride Culture are also anti-individuality on the surface, meaning that humans are best subsumed as automatons for the “greater good.” I also see this as influenced by Asian culture, which sees people as gears or parts of a societal machine rather than individuals choosing to come together to help each other. I perceive this as one reason communism was more easily embraced in Asian countries (like China). Filipino culture also has traditions that predetermine people’s roles in life and deny self-determination. An example of this is parents forcing children to provide for them rather than depend on pensions or their own sources. Children having the quality of self-determination is even condemned as evil. Western culture upholds self-determination and seeks to limit determination by someone else, while also providing alternatives such as benefits for the elderly.
Woke also goes hand in hand with decolonization, which seeks not only to remove the effects of western colonization, but also destroy the civilizations of the colonizers. I see some Filipinos as having the attitude of decolonization, but without knowledge on how to do it – which I am thankful for.
So, by blaming Western cultures as enemies, Woke and Pinoys practice:
4. Painting as evil ideas or people that are not really evil
Woke is actually about reversing good and evil in a process called Dialectical Inversion. They lie about being for the “oppressed” and being inclusive, but actually ostracize or call Nazis or right-wing others who are unlike them or who block their path to power. This includes anyone who adheres to the normal, or “cis,” values, like valuing the family institution, that male and female are the norm for genders, sex changes are unnatural, sex is not to be introduced to children, people best work for what they want rather then be given hand-outs, and other things that are tagged as “based” in today’s world.
At least Filipinos still adhere to what is normal, believing in family values and such. Filipinos however still ostracize those who feel different and don’t agree with them, but the basis is more on traditional culture, which has its own problems. Filipinos still have their own double standards, such as claiming to be oppressed in another country when a local has an offensive name like Kiki, claiming to be oppressed by the world but wanting to be an empire, and people in government claiming to be against corruption but participate in corruption themselves.
Another similar aspect among the two sides is the belief that misfortune is always someone else’s fault. For Wokes, misfortune or even just a little discomfort in life is the fault of the West or white people, or whoever is in power (During Marx’s time, it was the Jews; you may not believe it, but Marx was anti-Semitic, even if he himself was Jewish). Wokes reject the idea of self-responsibility, that if you make a mistake where you hurt yourself, you can’t blame others. Basically, all pain and suffering are manmade (always by others) and do not occur naturally. Filipinos have a similar attitude, demonstrated in situations such as, when they encounter a problem, the first thing they would do is look for someone to blame rather than a solution.
5. Embracing of irrationality over Rationality
Wokeness hates rationality, logic, and common sense as these are pillars of Western culture, whiteness or whatever thing they consider the source of oppression. Wokeness, communism, esotericism, postmodernism and all associated ideas seek to recast the village simpleton as the intellectual. If they don’t make sense, that’s the idea; anything that makes sense is evil.
When it comes to irrationality, Jean Jacques Rousseau is one major source of postmodern ideas leading to Communism and wokeness. As I wrote earlier, Rousseau believed that primitivity – which tends to be highly irrational – was the real state of purity. He promoted that but if you bring modern societies back to this, paradise is regained. But in practice, it means destroying things and killing a lot of people. When Rousseau said, “man is free but everywhere in chains,” I believe he wasn’t referring to human governments; he was referring to reality itself, how difficult life is. He wanted to rebel against reality. How to rebel? Use violence, hold uprisings and destroy governments and societies. Despite his eloquence, Rousseau was just mad at the world and wanted to bring it all down. That is the same kind of mentality as a mass shooter’s and is the real mindset behind Woke.
Filipinos, on the other hand, tend to be primitive and irrational for different reasons, poor education and poverty being some of them. Filipinos tend to believe in magic and stuff. With their lack of knowledge of facts and science, they just assume dumb things. You can see that in idle housewives who think they run their house so well that they believe they should run others’ lives, someone who believes a bakery should serve him bulalo, or the village leaders who decide that a mentally disabled person is to be caged. We’ve also talked about Filipino anti-intellectualism many times in this blog. This goes along with the expressions of desire for the primitive or “old” ways that some Filipinos post in nostalgia sites. When traditional beliefs tend to have their own problems similar to Woke, I see irrationality and primitivism as a common source.
Filipino emotionalism is often discussed in this blog site. I find it ironic since Filipinos are mostly Christian and Christianity carries a lot of stoic ideas in the New Testament. One of the things that perhaps helped ruin it is liberation theology which was influenced by Marxism.
Also, Philippine society is highly fractious and tribal, which many have cited as one of the major problems that bog down the country. This situation adds to the lack of education and maintaining of backward culture. I would say though that our country’s backward tribalism might appeal to Rousseau (that makes it no surprise when the Communists go to the mountains to recruit the far off tribes). Woke is actually very tribal and seeks to fracture society.
6. Both dream of ruling the world
As I said, the ultimate goal of Woke is to destroy the world. But they realize that staying the rebel group will not work towards this purpose. They have to take over and get power so that they could more effectively bring about the destruction of the world. They likely expect to rule over the destroyed world and it will magically reform to become their paradise.
This is reportedly why some old fictional properties, such as Star Wars, Disney properties, Hollywood movies, science fiction literature, and comic books, are being infiltrated by Wokes. This is not just to use such properties to promote Woke agendas; I suspect the real goal is to destroy them. That’s because these fictional properties were used to promote western values. Subverting these properties to use them to promote Woke values is a side goal, if it was indeed a goal; but if the properties are destroyed, they cannot be used anymore to promote western, Christian, or other “oppressive” values. The same applies to academic institutions. Woke in the United States is what the CPP-NPA is to us; claiming to be the cure for oppression when it only wants to take control of the oppression and turn it in their favor.
I’ve seen some Pinoys express the desire for a Philippine empire. I think most other Filipinos themselves will scoff as such a thing, and I agree. I believe we not only don’t deserve empire, but are incapable of having it. Even if we become a more prosperous country, we’re sure to bungle it because of incompetence or other reason.
Unbridled immigration is yet another issue. Some say loose controls on immigration are part of the decolonization agenda. People from poor and violent cultures come in, they bring in their backward culture and cause havoc in the once peaceful western country. The idea of closed borders is to protect societies from destructive elements.
Next are my suggested solutions to each of the above.
1. Filipinos should stop thinking of themselves as victims of the world. Victimhood mentality is not just caused by political influences but is also a personal values and culture issue. The way to live should be how the response to terrorism was suggested in this blog, specifically to live life like you’re not affected by it. If Filipinos make mistakes that shoot themselves in the foot, they should own up to their mistakes. They should reject the projection of poorness as an identity (poverty porn) and pursue “fixing themselves” in life. They should accept the differences in the states of people’s lives and not demand that they be the same as others and vice versa. Stop thinking of someone being in a better condition as “lamang” (having an advantage by putting one over them) and instead work towards that condition on your own if possible; or, find your own place without being like another person.
There’s this video on Youtube which explains how even elites can think they’re oppressed.
2. Filipinos best drop the arrogance of claiming to be “special” in the world. Self-projection and pride seem like good ways to deal with our difficult situations, but they are more like obstructions to the solution (There is a way but seems right, but in the end leads to death – Bible). In my church, I once held a talk for youth about the problems of social media. I said that when they look for pride on social media, they are actually looking for dignity. But the foolish things people do on social media do not bring them dignity, but actually deprive them of it. In saying that, I make pride and dignity separate ideas. I understand some people see pride as necessary for self-love or proof of life, but I also claim that they are mistaken. Tangible achievements are the real proof of life. This might seem very stoic for most, but I believe this will lead to more meaningful self-esteem.
Also, I have written about LGBTQIA-whatever pride marches not being normal pride, as in self-value, but as a projection of power expressing a desire to take over. Even if the movement did not start out that way, it has been co-opted by other interests to be that way today.
Instead of demanding respect on basis of self-perceived and pride-based identity, it is best based on the principle that one must respect others by default because they are fellow humans, until they commit a wrongdoing.
And, one important thing to realize is that Wokeness itself, by claiming “specialness” in having the authority to tag others racist, is itself racist and chauvinist.
3. Support the good effects of Colonialism on the Philippines. I support the paper The Case for Colonialism by Bruce Gilley. Western individuality and John Locke, the basis of human rights, are what we are supposed to embrace. In fact, the human rights charter in our Constitution almost copies Western Traditions like the American Amendments and the United Nations Human Rights Charter. Wokes or Filipinos who want to decolonize the country should drop the Human Rights charter for consistency. Filipinos should realize that many other ideas that become their basis for criticizing the West, such as anti-imperialism, come from the West itself.
We must also push back against primitivism, whether it comes from traditionalism or from Wokeness. Going back to the primitive and eschewing technological advances will not lead to purity but depravity. As I said before, you cannot put “noble” and “savage” together. Degrading to a more primitive form of living will also lead to many deaths. But so the same, neither will I seek imposition of high technology or higher lifestyles on others. People should choose and work for it themselves. Also, primitivism is likely based on the erroneous assumption of the Bible that became commonplace, the image of Adam and Eve being Tarzan and Jane and Eden being a natural jungle. Recent scholarship that shown that this interpretation is wrong…  but that’s best discussed in another article.
Filipinos must defend individuality and push back against monistic views of society. We must also push against decolonization, because it only seeks to destroy societies and people and reverse all advances and progress that saves lives. Also, on the question of collectivism vs. individualism, we should not see these as opposites but two necessary components. We should come together to help each other live, but we are individuals first and that is the building block of our collective.
Take note that I’m not against preservations of cultural traditions such as some tribes’ dance, music, dress, food, art and such, and I respect the work of some people on this.
4. and 5. I think these go hand in hand because ideas on good and evil are connected to rationality as well as aligning more with Western ideals. Filipinos best drop anti-intellectuality, along with the view of intelligence as used only for putting one over other people. Rejecting Rousseau’s ideas also rejects irrationality, leading to embracing the real rational modernity where misconceptions are busted, tribal backwardness is overcome, and evidence-based practices are supported. We must also promote a culture that seeks to make intellectuality (the right kind, not the “Gnostic” or “best and brightest become rulers” kind) available for all, although this will indeed require improvement of our country’s formal education. Yet changes in cultural education through the family, community and other informal means is just as important. I also support the removal of liberation theology from Catholic teaching.
Aside from being careful of Woke reversing good and evil, we must also be critical of parts of traditional culture similar to Woke. For example, even under traditional culture, people will believe that their assumptions or “akala” can replace the truth. And if they are proven wrong, they go all Karen. Who knows if this was the source of Wokeness after all (“the false notion that… my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” – Issac Asimov). Culture and tradition are not sacred but manmade, so people should feel that they have the right to change these if they find it reasonable to do so.
6. Stop dreaming of ruling the world. No one can actually rule the world. Humanity is imperfect and fractious. No one can hold a really big operation and keep it running for so long. Empires fall, and so will a world when it is “united” using force. Filipinos should have no dreams of empire or being the “first-world hegemony,” because we are not capable of that and it is an unethical goal. Besides, we have anti-imperialism in our own Constitution – the state rejecting war as an instrument of policy.
Filipinos should develop a society that values self-responsibility and self-sufficiency and should stop highlighting their dependence on the big nations. This might be aptly applied to the situation in the South China Sea and West Philippine Sea, as the Philippines’ tendency to side with a bigger “bully” only emphasizes its weakness.
Conquering the Similarities
So am I saying Wokeness and Pinoy Culture are the same? No. Pinoy Culture is still traditional, but with flaws that stem from the irrationality of humanity. These similarities are for me the actual things keeping the Philippines from becoming a safer and more prosperous society.
Wokeness is not modernity but postmodernism, which actually tries to counter modernity and draws from the irrational parts of both tradition and esoteric belief. What is modernity? Getting to the right ideas and fixing dysfunctions with rationality. Get Real Philippines’ theme of promoting cultural change seeks to overcome the irrationalities of both Woke and traditional culture with rational modernity (which has mostly Christian elements as well), thereby paving the way for a society that honors its commitments and uses its human capital the right way (following esteemed Webmaster Benign0’s explanation of poverty and capitalism).
Wokeness and Pinoy Culture have parallels because people in different places and contexts can still develop similar ideas. Ideas, bad or good, have a life of their own. If we in the Philippines are not careful, Woke ideas can also infiltrate us and cause all the trouble that the US is experiencing now.
Wokedom disguises itself as modernity and sometimes as tradition, and you couldn’t figure it out until the effects have already damaged people. Woke practices can also be seen as backward traditions being resurrected in a new form, such as the idea that certain “enlightened” people in a village should take power and lord it over others. For example, there’s a video of this Woke session where African students (Fallists) suggested throwing out science and replacing it with witchcraft. These are among the things to resist.
I know my ideas would meet much resistance. But I’m also confident that many are realizing the nature of the problem and the ideas in this article will gain traction and help many people in the end.",Politics
Donald Trump’s rallying cry is now “Fight!” — just like that of the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/donald-trumps-rallying-cry-is-now-fight-just-like-that-of-the-yellowtards/,"In an ironic twist of fate, former United States president Donald Trump is now basking in the limelight following his survival of an assassination attempt over the weekend. The Colonial Master’s politics now mirrors the necropolitics of its Mini-Me in southeast Asia — except that the beneficiary of the violence lived to fight on. CNN reports…
With a white bandage over the ear clipped just two days earlier by an attempted assassin’s bullet, Donald Trump stole the show when he made his first public appearance since the shooting on the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
Trump joined the man he’d chosen hours earlier as his vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in a box in the 10 p.m. Eastern time hour for Monday night’s final speeches.
The crowd chanted “fight” — the word a bloody-faced Trump had shouted several times, while pumping his fist in the air, as the Secret Service rushed him off the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.
It was just a small eternity ago that a similar “fight” (Laban!, in Tagalog) rhetoric created the cringy political mythology that would plunge the Philippines in an idolatrous stupor that would go on to span more than three decades. The assassination of former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 set the stage for the ouster of then President Ferdinand E. Marcos and usher in the Philippines’ Yellowtard era. This was an era of limp-dicked nationalism characterised by martyrs-as-hero idols (chief of whom was the now-late former Senator), the release of communist rebels many Filipino soldiers worked hard to track and capture, the accelerated decline of the Philippine military’s fighting capability, and the erosion of Filipinos’ English language proficiency.
Interestingly, there seemed to be no real will to walk the “fight” in the Yellowtard talk. For that, the Yellowtards relied on their chums in the New People’s Army  (NPA) — the terrorist arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines —  to walk their talk. Not that the NPA were any more effective. The NPA had evidently seen the back of their glory days and, in recent years, languished as a sad nuisance side show in the Philippines. To cite a recent example of the lameness of the Yellowtard “fight”, the campaign of former Vice President Leni Robredo who put in a competing bid for the presidency in the lead up to the 2022 elections flew a pink banner and used misguided gender ideology as pillars to their efforts to woo what remains an essentially conservative society. Not surprisingly, that whole approach failed catastrophically.
So now Filipinos now find Father America on a similar boat. But this time it is the “bad guys” who are deftly engineering a public perception that is making the liberals shit their pants. Even more ironic, they now call for unity as Reuters reports…
U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity.
Within hours of Saturday’s shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications, including those that had highlighted Trump’s May felony conviction in New York state court relating to hush money paid to a porn star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 U.S. election.
“We must unite as one nation,” Biden said in White House remarks on Sunday, adding he would have an Oval Office address in the evening. Biden condemned political violence again, as he did on Saturday night, and asked Americans to “let the FBI do their job.”
The US has turned into Bizzarro Philippines — the Republicans shouting Laban! and the Democrats calling for “unity”.",Politics
Is the Philippines the Looming Ukraine of Asia?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/is-the-philippines-the-looming-ukraine-of-asia/,"Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos welcomed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a one-day visit to the Philippines after he spoke at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore which Marcos attended last week as the keynote speaker.
The visit drew a comparison at the situation of Ukraine, which is seen by geopolitical analysts as engaged in a proxy war for the US against Russia.
In less than two years, the war between Russia and Ukraine has killed and injured over 500,000 people, major cities have been bombed to the ground, and the long-term damage to infrastructure is incalculable.
Zelenskyy led thousands of his people to death and destruction of his country
More than 10 million people have been displaced, with over 6.3 million seeking refuge outside Ukraine. While Zelenskyy claims victory, he has to go begging for more money from Western-allied countries after over 500,000 people have been killed or injured, this is not including the millions in Ukraine who face severe hardship, especially during winter, due to the damage to essential services like heating, electricity, and water supply. Zelenskyy has also lowered the army draft age from 27 to 25, increased the penalties for those who refuse to join the war, and banned elections and persecuted opposition groups including the media.
Economic impact of war in Ukraine
Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) has shrunk by 25% since 2022 and now suffers a budget deficit of 23% of GDP (excluding grants). The Ukrainian Hryvnia has depreciated by 21% against the US dollar. Ukraine’s debt to GDP increased from 49% in 2021 to 85% today. Approximately 40% of Ukraine’s electricity-generating capacity destroyed since the war began. Russia currently has taken control of about 41,000 square miles (17.5%) of Ukraine, including territory occupied before 2022. These statistics highlight the extensive and ongoing suffering of the people created by the conflict with long term painful impact for both Ukraine and the broader international community.
Is the Philippines becoming an outcast in ASEAN?
Marcos’s speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue drew mixed reactions from political and policy experts because of the conflict in his statements about Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality and the balancing act member states are subject to between the US and China. Ironically, not a single ASEAN member has come out in support of Marcos’s policies in the South China Sea with regard to the disputed areas and the pivot to the US of the Philippines which has resulted in the trilateral alliance between the US, Japan and the Philippines. On the contrary, Singapore’s Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysia’s Anwar Ibrahim have warned of the dangers that the track the Philippines has undertaken under Marcos administration.
Unlike his predecessors, Marcos has given unfettered access for the US military to build bases around the Philippines, including in Cagayan province, facing Taiwan which China has repeatedly said is a red-line.
In contrast, ASEAN has continued bilateral discussions and expanded cooperation with China.
The Philippines has again adopted a policy of hostility against China similar to the policy of the Aquino administration, which resulted in the loss of Scarborough Shoal during the stand-off with China in 2012. Ironically, the loss of Scarborough was due to the US betrayal of the Philippines because Albert Del Rosario and Jose Cuisia “trusted” the US, and allowed the US to negotiate with China without the Philippines at the table.
The Ongoing South China Sea dispute between the Philippines and China’s significant economic implications
China is the Philippines’ top trading partner, with trade valued at $87.7 billion in 2022. However, in the first nine months of 2023, trade fell by 16% to $54.1 billion. Our trade officials attribute this to an overall slowdown in regional trade, but it cannot be discounted that, if bullets start flying, business will be significantly affected.
The decrease in Chinese tourist arrivals to the Philippines is felt more significantly by the local and provincial economies that depend highly on foreign spending.
China also quickly became the second largest source of foreign tourists to the Philippines reaching almost 1.7 million in 2019. Chinese tourists are known as the top buyers of luxury goods and accommodations worldwide, and that’s why many countries in the world are extending additional efforts to attract more Chinese tourist.
But Chinese tourists visiting the Philippines dropped to 263,000 in 2023, according to the Department of Tourism.
While the decrease may be partly due to China’s economic slowdown in the aftermath of the pandemic, there are also reports that the Philippines has made it harder for Chinese nationals to obtain visas during the Marcos administration, prompting Chinese tourists to go to other ASEAN countries, with less restrictive visa requirements. After all, any thinking person would ask: Why would you spend your money on a country that keeps provoking you?
While some of our politicians warn of a looming Chinese invasion, South Korea and Japan are putting more Chinese signs in their shops and even hiring Mandarin-speaking staff to prepare their countries for the expected resurgence of Chinese tourists. Chinese visitors to South Korea and Japan totaled about 2 million and 2.5 million Chinese tourists respectively. In 2023, Thailand attracted 3.5 million Chinese tourists, Vietnam had 1.75 million, and Singapore had 1.4 million. What is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Tourism doing about this?
Despite the numerous foreign trips Marcos had undertaken since he assumed office, foreign direct investment is still not even close to the levels attracted by other ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Despite the closer relationship with the US, tech giants Google and Microsoft opted to put their money in Malaysia over the Philippines. Philippine ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez boasted of billions in economic investments from the US. To this day, these are no where to be seen. Are we being fooled again?
The West is abandoning Ukraine after using it as a pawn against Russia
With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians dead and his country turned into a wasteland, Zelenskyy has to go around the world begging for support, a clear sign of dwindling US backing. Zelenskyy invited Marcos to the upcoming Peace Summit in Switzerland, which was accepted. The peace summit has been criticized by many experts for not inviting Vladimir Putin considering he is the president of Russia. Did anyone ask how can it be called a peace summit when the other party in the war is not invited?
Ironically, after Zelenskyy’s invitation was accepted by Marcos, the White House announced that President Biden will not attend the summit and that Vice President Kamala Harris would attend instead.

The numbers all point to a FAILED demolition job against the Dutertes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/the-numbers-all-point-to-a-failed-demolition-job-against-the-dutertes/,"The mathematics of election and impeachment are quite simple. It really depends on the people at the end of the day; the conviction or acquittal of Vice-President Sara Duterte from the impeachment complaint filed against her. The Ensaymorons fell silent yesterday faced with the reality revealed by the survey conducted by WR Numero — that a good number of Filipinos are opposed to her Impeachment. Inday is still more trusted than President Bongbong Marcos (BBM) and she still leads the presidential race in 2028. This after the demolition job against her and her father that began in 2023. There was a disturbance in the force and it was palpable.
I riled an Ensaymoron friend who immediately whipped out the Octa survey that revealed that “36% of respondents support the Marcos Administration while 18% were pro-Duterte.” I said look at the dates. One has to be factual to be objective. Unfortunately, the Ensaymorons are bereft of logic. The word that is on every critical thinking mind is lameduck but nobody wants to say it. The president usually has momentum going into the midterm election but as the proclamation rally’s have proved, there is no momentum.
Sure the pro-administration candidates will win but if the impeachment proceedings will begin in June, each of the 24 senators will have 2028 on their minds. At the end of the day, first and foremost is their political survival. A conviction would have severe political repercussions. This would have an impact on the senators who are up for re-election in 2028.
Then there’s the Supreme Court. Should the impeachment be struck down, this gives Inday breathing room. But the sword of Damocles would still be hanging over her head since the goal is to take her out of the presidential race, permanently. She will be impeached again for sure once the one year ban has lapsed.
At this point, what’s certain is that neither side will be able to gain any ground. The administration is under the microscope for the lack of palpable economic progress. It’s all optics. The demolition of the Duterte’s will only stop when Inday isn’t a contender for 2028 anymore. Nonetheless, Manila Standard columnist Lito Banayo observes…
Unless the President dangles goodies too difficult to resist, as in the Corona conviction, these senators will wait for the opinion signs that would be blowin’ in the wind.
One factor to consider is how the former president, still commanding the loyalty of a huge number of followers, will take an adverse outcome. In Cebu, he rallied support for his ticket by stating that his daughter’s fate would depend on the numbers.
His support is hard; the President’s support base is softened continuously by economic woes he is unable to surmount.
This brings to mind hindsight on Inday’s decision to be the running mate in 2022. Obviously she wasn’t cognizant of the political realities the way her father saw it in his head. It was a marriage of convenience which was made in hell without Inday realizing it. She probably relied on her friendship with Imee Marcos and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s (GMA’s) advise for her to run if only to prevent the possibility of a Robredo presidency.
But with 47% of the public against impeachment, the administration should also wake up to the reality that its demolition job failed. The image of the frail former president hitting the campaign trail for his candidates impacts on the public. Former President Rodrigo Duterte proved in Cebu that he can still hold a crowd captive and his emotional appeal for votes to save his daughter strikes a chord in voters. Contrast this with the video of Negros Oriental Governor Chaco Sagarbarria imploring the crowd to chant BBM and getting a very tepid response and you have an idea of the public sentiment. You can see by the look on the faces of the administration candidates that they’re in an awkward spot because it’s obvious that the president isn’t able to generate crowd enthusiasm despite his best effort.
All we can do is watch to see what the outcome will be as it’s too difficult to even speculate at this point. The only certainty at this point is the Duterte magic is not dead in their bailiwicks. It will be interesting what the reaction would be of the voters in Luzon. But if Duterte’s candidates can win in Metro Manila and pick up votes in vote-rich provinces in Region 3, 4, 5 and 6, they stand a chance of electing at least 4 senators.",Politics
Yellowtard-Communist Axis out for revenge against former President Rodrigo Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/yellowtard-communist-axis-out-for-revenge-against-former-president-rodrigo-duterte/,"We called it back in the campaign leadup to the May 2022 national elections. Even back then, it was evident that the Opposition, presumed to be led by the Yellowtard-Communist Axis, already imagined the subsequent six years following that election marked by revenge directed at former President Rodrigo Duterte.
Among those they planned to “avenge” was the failure to renew the public broadcasting franchise of revered media conglomerate ABS-CBN. One of the pillars of the Opposition campaign was an initiative to get showbiz personalities to run for office and “push back”.
…the fact that the Opposition would actually espouse such an intellectually-bankrupt campaign platform as the Revenge Platform upon which former ABS-CBN starlets would run, as Badoy suggests, proves just how singularly-focused the Yellowtards are at seizing power at all costs. They would go as far as encouraging Filipino voters to vote like starstruck ignoramuses just to further their dishonest power-hungry agenda.
Fast forward to today with a catastrophic electoral defeat in that election behind them, the Yellowtard-Communist Axis remains firmly latched onto their quest for vengeance. Their strategy remains disturbingly the same — mount a trial-and-effort push into all conceivable avenues of attack. The avenues are all-too-familiar: impeachment, inviting foreign intervention, and getting in bed with enemies of their enemies among others. The latter is the most disturbing. They now cosy up to the administration of President Bongbong Marcos — people they once regarded as devils embodied.
To be fair, Opposition “thought leaders” find themselves in a conundrum. Marcos has, himself, cosied up to the Philippines’ former colonial master, the United States of which they are big fans of. Recall that the pivot away from the US and towards China that marked the Duterte administration was one of the things that sent the Yellowtards out hopping mad. The shared pro-America values they now share with the Marcos administration now has them “re-evaluating” their ideological foundations.
The only pathway to satisfying the bloodthirsty power-hungry agenda of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis is to crush the Duterte brand — even if it means getting into a mutual back-scratching alliance with the “evil” Marcos dynasty. The be-all-end-all objective here is to acquire (in the case of the Yellowtards, reacquire) power and glory. Often that means selling their souls to that singular goal. And these people will.",Politics
NTC Asked to have SMNI Investigated for Possible Violations,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/ntc-asked-to-have-smni-investigated-for-possible-violations/,"The so-called Makabayan Bloc in the House of Representatives filed House Resolution 1428 demanding the condemnation of the death threats issued by former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte against House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Party List Congresswoman France Castro.
Also in the said resolution, Castro’s group also asked for the National Telecommunications Commission to have the Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) to be investigated for possible violations of the Kapisanan ng Brodkaster ng Pilipinas code of ethical conduct.
The resolution reportedly states, “SMNI also violates numerous provisions of the 2007 Broadcaster Code of the Philippines, which is the code of professional and ethical standard for the members of the Kapisanan ng Broadcaster ng Pilipinas. In particular, SMNI violated its duties as regard the credibility sources and report, prohibition of personal attacks, correcting mistakes, and others.”
Although yours truly believes that SMNI should be shut down permanently and its owner Pastor Apollo Quiboloy to be extradited to the United States to face indictment for sex trafficking of minors, it should not stop us from pointing to the gross hypocrisy of both sides of this war between Duterte and Castro’s group.
A source of ours claims that Duterte and Castro’s group represent warring factions within the communist terrorist group CPP NPA NDF.
We would be happy to see Duterte as well as Castro and her group face trial and punishment for extra judicial killings or murder. Unmentioned by Castro is that for 50 years the CPP NPA NDF has been murdering not only soldiers and police but also people whom they branded as enemies of their revolution — including its own members.
That said, we still agree that SMNI should be investigated and possibly found guilty of violating KBP broadcast standards for journalistic ethics for allegedly allowing itself to be used by former President Duterte to lob death threats as well as make admissions of criminal acts.
Moreover, this writer thinks that the continued operation of the Quiboloy owned SMNI makes a mockery of the KBP — for it is allowing someone charged with serious international crimes to control a vital enterprise, possibly influencing the entire nation with his impunity before the law.
We wonder why, though, President Bongbong Marcos himself hasn’t himself asked the NTC to act on the possible violations committed very publicly? Or, for that matter, why hasn’t House Speaker Martin Romualdez himself made the same resolution, instead of making just a show of force?
Looking at all of this, it is pretty clear that this country has given itself over to the rule of wicked and evil powers.
I pray that all of its peoples repent of its ways and seek God’s mercy.

If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

The Duterte camp remain an unmatched force when it comes to engaging ordinary Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/the-duterte-camp-remain-an-unmatched-force-when-it-comes-to-engaging-ordinary-filipinos/,"The problem with Opposition blogger Katrina Stuart-Santiago is she’s lucid at some point then irrationality overtakes her and she becomes another mumbling fool like the rest of her cohorts in the so-called 0pposition. In her most recent post, “Ponder propaganda: Fueling the Duterte machine”, she first astutely issues an indictment of her own camp’s handling of their messaging over the last several years culminating in their devastating defeat in the 2022 elections…
[…] we have been driving blind since the campaign for the 2022 elections — maybe even since the Senatorial campaign of 2019. To an extent, it seems like we’ve been content in the delusion that righteousness, with a dollop of troll army, is all that we need to battle it out in this landscape. We believe that because we are “right” then that will win us this battle.
And, as a result, pointing out their situation today observing how, “we are in over our heads where propaganda is concerned, because we have been outdone for most of Duterte’s six years, and we continue to be outdone two years into this Marcos-Duterte leadership.” But then she laments, at some point…
[Former President Rodrigo] Duterte had set the stage for this present, where the opposition, at best, has completely lost its footing, regardless of where we are on that spectrum that spans the Liberals and the Left.
Even before the advent of social media, content has always been the king. Recall how, back in the 1980s, then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile funded the weekend magazine Mr. & Ms. to get the public thinking and start opposing Marcos. Filipinos could still read back then so it was effective but only up until who the publication reached. I was a teenager then so I had no idea how the masa thought. Think of me as the moron Gen Z or millennial today.
Three of my staffers are between the age of 24 to 31. They don’t read the news. I asked them who they voted for in 2022. The 24-year-old went for the leading tandem of Leni Robredo and Kiko Pangilinan. The 31-year-old voted for Team Bongbong Marcos and Inday Sara Duterte. The 28-year-old split his vote and went Ping Lacson and Sara Duterte. You know who’s the most entitled? The 24-year-old who graduated cum laude from UPLB and landed her first job which pays P43k per month as an Executive Assistant 2 on a coterminous basis. I asked her why she voted for the two. The answer was she thought they would be best for the country because of the programs under the Office of the Vice President. When I asked her if she knew how government functioned, she couldn’t answer the question. The other two had a simpler answer. Strong leadership is what they were looking for.
I’m no Duterte apologist but he appealed to me in 2016 because of his pragmatism. It was street-smart pragmatism which appealed to the masa and also those in the A, B, and C crowds who wanted peace and order back in their communities. What Stuart-Santiago doesn’t notice is how the Marcos administration has been following in the footsteps of the opposition. The Dutertes are considered to be outliers. Inquirer columnist Richard Heydarian even described former President Duterte as an “anomaly”. The basis for this is they don’t belong to the so-called intellectual class, per their definition. Duterte isn’t known for his sartorial taste but he definitely has intellectual depth.
I wouldn’t say the same for Inday because she’s a millennial as well. Clearly she’s not at the same level as her father intellectually. To my mind, the 24-year-old UPLB grad defines the Opposition voter base, with a sprinkling of the masa from Region 5. Tribalism is the reason for this. But in terms of communication, it’s hard to beat Duterte at this game. He knows exactly which buttons to push and when. None of his rivals possess anywhere near the same inherent ability Duterte applies in engaging the public successfully.
There’s not much to look forward to in the next four years because the Opposition and President Bongbong Marcos are now sharing Uncle Sam’s bed. They also have made the Dutertes a common enemy. They think this is enough for them to last through the next four years and beyond. Without a new and genuine opposition led by the Dutertes, the public has no choice so they will settle for Marcos and his cousin House Speaker Martin Romualdez eventually. Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) doesn’t look like she will break away from the most powerful political bloc in the country today. She will be content to have a nominal seat without any real power.
Duterte’s only protection now against persecution are the Senators who are still in his camp. Their reelection is going to be his priority unless he decides to come out of retirement for what will be a bigger battle than his presidential campaign — to become the legitimate opposition and fiscalize the Marcos administration.",Politics
VP Inday Sara Duterte Carpio Hogs 13 Percent of 2024 National Budget,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/vp-inday-sara-duterte-carpio-hogs-13-percent-of-2024-national-budget/,"At perhaps no other point in this country’s history as somewhat of a democracy, we have a Vice President hogging 13 percent of our country’s Php 5.768 trillion national budget for 2024.
According to various reports the Department of Education proposed a Php 758.6 billion, the Office of the Vice President proposed a budget of Php 2.3 billion, and the NTF ELCAC, Php 8.6 billion. This totals to roughly Php 769.5 billion.
It is an unprecedented amount for a Vice President of the Philippines to command and control more than a tenth of the country’s spending.
If you haven’t read my previous articles before, where I outlined how VP Inday has positioned herself to strongly influence if not control the results of the barangay elections this year as well as the coming 2025 elections, just consider this:
Of course, VP Inday will defend her proposed budget before the House of Representatives and while legislators will make a public show of scrutinizing her 2024 budget, there will still be a huge chunk of it that will be approved behind closed doors.
That sizeable chunk I am referring to is VP Inday’s huge Intelligence Funds which is at a staggering P650 million through both the Office of the Vice President (P500 million) and the DepEd (P150 million). That is not to mention another P150 million which she can tap through the NTF ELCAC — making for a total of P800 million in intelligence funds.
In a video on Twitter, VP Inday justified her huge confidential budget in DepEd by saying that education  involves national security and admits that how the money will be spent will not be open to public scrutiny
Vice President and Education Sec. Sara Duterte defends DepEd’s proposal to be given P150M confidential funds for 2024.
“Education is intertwined with national security. Napakahalaga that we mold children who are patriotic,children who will love and defend our country,” she says.… pic.twitter.com/i5JaoD7fAK

Education is intertwined with national security? It would be absurd if she meant that children going to public schools would be under surveillance for any indication that they are in contact with people or groups identified as enemies of the state?
Or would it be more likely that the so-called intelligence funds would be used for political operations? Such as keeping tabs on political players on the provincial down to the barangay level, putting local political/media operators on a payroll, and subrosa political moves like maintaining a dossier of illegal activities perpetrated by every relevant political actor.
Ah well! Once again, we are seeing Filipinos being cooked in their own grease… In suo sibi pinguedine coctus!

Why VP Inday Sara Hasn’t Said A Word Regarding The Chinese Coast Guard Water Cannon Incident,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/why-vp-inday-sara-hasnt-said-a-word-regarding-the-chinese-coast-guard-water-cannon-incident/,"It is really no wonder why Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio has not said a word about the incident involving a Chinese Coast Guard vessel shooting a water cannon at a Philippine Coast Guard Vessel.
While it is tempting to say that VP Inday’s loyalty really belongs to the People’s Republic of China, it is more accurate to say that her self interest overrides and outweighs any need to demonstrate fealty towards either China or the Philippines.
While many high-ranking officials have expressed their condemnation and demanded justice, one notable figure has remained conspicuously silent: Vice President Inday. This silence has raised eyebrows and led to various speculations about her true loyalties. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals a complex interplay of loyalty and self-interest that may explain her reticence.
Critics argue that Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio’s silence may be indicative of her loyalty lying with the People’s Republic of China. As a member of the Duterte political dynasty, which has been accused of having close ties with China, this suspicion is not unfounded.
While loyalty can be a powerful motivator, self-interest often plays an equally significant role, if not more so, in shaping an individual’s actions. Vice President Inday, like any politician, undoubtedly has her own aspirations and political ambitions. Remaining silent on such a sensitive issue could be a strategic move to protect her own interests and maintain a delicate balance between the Philippines and China.
Moreover, let us remember that Vice President Inday is being summoned by the International Criminal Court along with her father, former president Rodrigo R. Duterte. When an arrest warrant for both figures is issued followed by a serious attempt at capturing both and the Philippine government allows it to happen, Rodrigo and Inday may need a place to seek asylum. Where else could they turn to except the People’s Republic of China?
Also, we must consider that for several years now, it has been said that several politicians are on the payroll of the People’s Republic of China and the ongoing rumor is that China is very likely going to support the incipient 2028 presidential campaign of VP Inday.
That aside, it can also be said that Vice President Inday is also well aware of the complexities of international relations and the potential consequences of her words and actions.
By choosing not to comment on the incident, it is also plausible that she may be attempting to navigate the treacherous waters of diplomacy, where one misstep could have far-reaching implications for the nation. Her silence could be a calculated move to avoid exacerbating tensions and to allow the appropriate channels of diplomacy to address the issue.
In the world of politics, timing is everything. Vice President Inday’s silence may be a strategic maneuver to gauge public sentiment and assess the political landscape before taking a definitive stance. By observing the reactions of the Filipino people, she can better position herself to align with the prevailing sentiment and maximize her political capital.
While the silence of Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio regarding the incident involving a Chinese Coast Guard vessel shooting a water cannon at a Philippine Coast Guard vessel may raise suspicions about her loyalties, it is crucial to consider the multifaceted nature of loyalty and the influence of self-interest. As a member of the Duterte political dynasty, she undoubtedly faces complex political dynamics and the need to carefully navigate the delicate balance between the Philippines and China.
Therefore, her silence may be a calculated move driven by strategic considerations rather than an outright display of loyalty to China.
In the ever-evolving landscape of international relations, it is essential to approach such situations with a nuanced perspective, recognizing the multitude of factors at play.
Peace be upon you!

Businesswoman Impoverished by Inday Sara’s Condonation of Hubby’s Shenanigans With King of Baclaran Edward Diokno Eje,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/businesswoman-impoverished-by-inday-saras-condonation-of-hubbys-shenanigans-with-king-of-baclaran-edward-diokno-eje/,"The case of master swindler Edward Diokno Eje a. k. a. hari ng baclaran (who foisted the “Malacañang appointment scam” on about a dozen or so people) didn’t quite explode in traditional news media and social media scenes.
This was, perhaps, because of the massive “news management” effort orchestrated to contain the situation and keep Vice President Inday Sara Duterte Carpio’s name out of it — or at least the part of her name that she drops depending on the state of her marital relations.
After all, Edward Diokno Eje’s brother is said to be one of Inday Sara’s army of staff members and he is also a kumpare sa inaanak of Inday Sara’s husband lawyer Mans or Mons Carpio.
Diokno Eje reportedly swindled about one billion pesos from people seeking appointments to various positions, bid awards for government projects, and a gaming franchise from the PCSO.
They all fell for his lies of being able to secure such things for a hefty fee, which they all paid happily until they discovered it was all a scam.
One of the biggest losers, if not THE biggest loser, is a businesswoman from the Visayas who got scammed out of P300 million by Diokno Eje. Allegedly, the so-called Hari ng Baclaran convinced the businesswoman that for P300 million, he could get her a gaming franchise from the PCSO that would be worth billions of pesos. The short of it is that Diokno Eje gave her fake PCSO documents supposedly granting the franchise and when the scam was discovered, the slimey gutterball began threatening the businesswoman.
Afraid for her life and having seen Diokno Eje brandish so many pictures of his connection with Mans Carpio as well as Paolo Duterte (the brother of Inday Sara), she messaged the then Davao City Mayor on her Instagram account asking for her protection and help in recovering her money from Diokno Eje.
The message was just “seen” and later, though it is not clear how, the businesswoman received a message from Atty. Mans asking that they (Inday Sara and himself) be kept out of the mess surrounding the purported PCSO franchise scam foisted on her.
But here’s the clincher: The businesswoman said that she wouldn’t have fallen for the scam had she not gotten assurances from Mans and others that Diokno Eje was a “legit operator” or in other words an honest “fixer”.
In other words, Inday Sara’s silence practically condoned the scam her husband knew about and probably signed off on in some way.
Years after the perpetration of the scam, the businesswoman had to sell off her properties and close down almost all her businesses just to get by. She has practically been reduced to living hand to mouth and staving off demands from her creditors.
And as for Diokno Eje… No one knows if he is still detained at the CIDG or if he has already been silenced forever — a loose end, eliminated.
P.S.
It seems rather odd that the DepEd issued a statement welcoming the arrest of Diokno Eje (did this have anything to do with the P50 million fumigation contract awarded to the King of Baclaran?). Likewise, Paolo Duterte also issued a disavowal of knowing Diokno Eje.

Trillanes Lists Dutertes Sixteen Acts of Betrayal,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/trillanes-lists-dutertes-sixteen-acts-of-betrayal/,"After we thought former Senator Antonio Trillanes had faded away, it seems he has had a resurgence and is now mouthing off against the Dutertes on full volume.
Just yesterday or the day before, he came out on X/Twitter to list down what he claims are acts of betrayal perpetrated by former president Rodrigo Duterte.
Ito po ang listahan ng mga katrayduran ni Duterte:
1.Isinantabi ang Arbitral Tribunal ruling;
2.Pinahinto ang EDCA;
3.Pinahinto ang VFA (2020-2021);

— Sonny Trillanes IV (@TrillanesSonny) August 22, 2023
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
At the end of this list, he took a swipe at Vice President Inday Sara Duterte by posting an old video of her speaking in Chinese — seemingly greeting Chinese president Xi Jinping on some occasion.
1. Set aside the Arbitral Tribunal ruling:
One of the most significant betrayals, according to Trillanes, was Duterte’s decision to set aside the Arbitral Tribunal ruling on the South China Sea dispute. The ruling, which favored the Philippines, was seen as a significant victory for the country. However, Duterte’s decision to downplay the ruling and pursue closer ties with China raised concerns about his commitment to defending national interests.
2. Stopped the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA):
The termination of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was seen by Trillanes as a betrayal of the country’s security interests. The agreement allowed for increased military cooperation between the Philippines and the United States, which was seen as crucial in deterring potential threats in the region.
3. Terminated the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) (2020-2021):
The termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States was another decision that raised eyebrows. The VFA provided a legal framework for U.S. forces to operate in the Philippines and was seen as a crucial element of the country’s defense strategy. Trillanes argues that terminating the agreement weakened the country’s defense capabilities and undermined its relationship with its long-standing ally.
4. Allowed the entry of hundreds of thousands of Chinese POGO workers, which may have led to the entry of Chinese soldiers:
The entry of Chinese POGO workers in large numbers has been a contentious issue in recent years. Trillanes believes that allowing their entry without proper scrutiny may have inadvertently allowed Chinese soldiers to enter the country. This raises concerns about national security and the potential infiltration of foreign military elements.
5. Allowed the entry of the Chinese Telecommunications Company (DITO):
The entry of the Chinese telecommunications company, DITO, has also been a subject of concern. Trillanes argues that allowing a Chinese company to operate critical telecommunications infrastructure raises questions about data security and potential espionage activities.
6. Chose and received kickbacks from Sinovac despite it being the least effective vaccine:
Trillanes accuses Duterte of choosing and receiving kickbacks from Sinovac, a Chinese vaccine manufacturer, despite it being considered one of the least effective vaccines available. This raises concerns about the transparency and integrity of the government’s vaccine procurement process.
7. Allowed the construction of Chinese cell towers within AFP bases:
The construction of Chinese cell towers within Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bases is seen as a potential security risk. Trillanes argues that allowing Chinese companies to build critical infrastructure within military installations compromises national security and could potentially facilitate espionage activities.
8. Sent AFP officers for military training in China:
Sending AFP officers for military training in China raised concerns about the influence China could exert over the Philippine military. Trillanes argues that such training programs could compromise the loyalty and independence of the armed forces.
9. Purchased military equipment from China:
Trillanes believes that purchasing military equipment from China compromises national security. There are concerns about the reliability and interoperability of Chinese-made equipment, as well as potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by China in case of a conflict.
10. Insulted the European Union:
Duterte’s derogatory remarks towards the European Union (EU) have strained diplomatic relations. Trillanes argues that insulting a key trading partner and ally undermines the country’s international standing and economic interests.
11. Stated intentions to form alliances with Russia and China:
Trillanes criticizes Duterte’s stated intentions to form alliances with Russia and China, as it raises concerns about the country’s alignment and potential shift away from traditional allies. This shift could have far-reaching consequences for the country’s security and economic interests.
12. Declared separation from the US and alignment with China:
Duterte’s declaration of separation from the United States and alignment with China has been a controversial move. Trillanes argues that such a shift in foreign policy could have long-term consequences for the country’s security and economic well-being.
13. Merged the Chinese Communist Party and the PDP-Laban:
The alleged merging of the Chinese Communist Party and the PDP-Laban, Duterte’s political party, raises concerns about foreign interference in the country’s political landscape. Trillanes argues that such a merger compromises the country’s democratic institutions and sovereignty.
14. During the onset of the Covid pandemic, Duterte did not implement an immediate lockdown to avoid offending China:
Trillanes accuses Duterte of failing to implement an immediate lockdown during the onset of the Covid pandemic to avoid offending China. This decision, according to Trillanes, compromised public health and safety in favor of maintaining friendly relations with China.
15. Appealed to make the Philippines a province of China:
Duterte’s appeal to make the Philippines a province of China, even if made in jest, raised concerns about his commitment to defending the country’s sovereignty. Trillanes argues that such statements undermine the country’s national interests and erode public trust in the government.
16. Insulted US President Obama:
Trillanes points out Duterte’s insulting remarks towards former US President Barack Obama, which strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. Such insults, according to Trillanes, undermine the country’s international standing and damage its alliances.
Former Senator Sonny Trillanes’ list of alleged betrayals by former President Rodrigo Duterte raises valid concerns about the country’s sovereignty, security, and international relations. Each point on the list, when examined critically, highlights potential compromises in national interests and the need for accountability and transparency in governance. It is essential for the Filipino people to remain vigilant and hold their leaders accountable for their actions to ensure the protection of the nation’s interests.

Analyzing Duterte’s Magically Increased Budget and Totalitarian Tendencies,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/analyzing-dutertes-magically-increased-budget-and-totalitarian-tendencies/,"In a recent article on One News, it was reported that the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) budget for 2022 had increased by 32% following the assumption of office by Sara Duterte. The budget hike has raised concerns regarding President Duterte’s potential abuse of power and privileges, leading to questions about her totalitarian tendencies. In this article, we will delve deeper into this issue and analyze the implications of these budget changes.
The OVP’s significant budget increase raises eyebrows, as it surpasses the average percentage growth rate of other government agencies. Such a substantial increase prompts us to question the motives behind this decision. It is important to note that unchecked power can lead to corruption, and history has shown that excessive concentration of resources can be used to suppress dissent and consolidate control.
Documents  showed that the Office of the Vice President (OVP)’s 2022 budget ballooned by 32 percent to P947.1 million as of end-2022, from the original P713.4 million approved under Republic Act 11936 or the General Appropriations Act of 2022.
Totalitarian Tendencies
Totalitarian regimes are characterized by leaders who exercise absolute power with little regard for democratic principles. While it would be premature to label President Duterte’s actions as unequivocally totalitarian, her persistent tendency to centralize power and disregard institutional checks raises concerns.
By expanding the budget of her office considerably, Duterte may potentially gain more control over resources, which could be utilized to serve her own interests rather than the greater good. In a democratic society, it is crucial to maintain transparent and equitable distribution of resources to ensure accountability and avoid the consolidation of power in a single entity.
As mentioned in previous posts, Inday Sara has strategically poised herself for a run for President in 2028 by using her appointment as Education Secretary to control public school teachers who man election precincts and her appointment as Co Vice Chair of the NTF ELCAC to use its P9 billion Barangay Development Program as the largest pork barrel fund in Philippine history. This is not to mention the establishment of previously unheard of Satellite Offices for the Office of the Vice President, which garnered criticism after being flagged by the Commission on Audit for not following its rules.
The significant hike in the OVP’s budget following Sara Duterte assuming office raises legitimate concerns about the abuse of power and privileges associated with her role.
While it is important to note that further analysis and evidence may be required to solidify these claims, overlooking these concerns can have long-term consequences for democracy and accountability.
It is imperative for citizens and institutions to carefully scrutinize the actions and decisions of those in power to ensure that the principles and foundations of democracy are preserved. Consequently, it is crucial to engage in open discussions and debates to hold public officials accountable for their actions, safeguarding the democratic ideals that underpin our society.

The Opposition MUST move on from their obsolete EDSA narrative and evolve into something BETTER,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/the-opposition-must-move-on-from-their-obsolete-edsa-narrative-and-evolve-into-something-better/,"We must never assume it thinks like the rest of us. Of public opinion Randy David writes in his latest Inquirer piece, “Awkward commemoration, missed opportunity” where he goes at length to elucidate the cringe surrounding this year’s EDSA people power commemoration activities. Interestingly, David proceeds to criticize Marcos again for not extending the hand of unity. He observes how, on this occasion, President Bongbong Marcos “opted to be silent about the event, preferring to delegate an official duty to his executive secretary, who issues on his behalf a perfunctory advisory adjusting the date of the nonworking public holiday as homage to the benefits of a long weekend” and then writes;
[…] the President could have used the Edsa commemoration to acknowledge the lingering sensitivities that continue to divide us — and call for national healing. He could have sealed such a call with a directive to the secretary of justice, mandating him to immediately review the cases against detained former senator Leila de Lima with a view to withdrawing them and releasing her at once if the evidence is lacking.
But then Marcos actually did just that in the statement he issued. David must’ve missed it. For the life of me, I don’t understand what remaining significance EDSA still holds. What I didn’t write down yesterday was the false hope it gave me that change had come. The feeling was similar to the what I felt going on a peace retreat before my high school graduation. I felt closer to God. I wanted to change after seeing the error of my ways. But reality crept back in and made me realize that you can’t be a good person where there are plenty of evil ones who are out to get you. This is what former President Cory Aquino sold to the Filipinos in 1986. As we will note from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) count then, it was a close one. I thought then that most Filipinos thought a lot like myself but I realized how wrong I was about this when I finally had the opportunity to travel the length and breadth of the Visayas and Mindanao regions.
Ninoy, Cory and Noynoy are all dead. There were no more Aquinos left to carry on their narrative. On the other hand, there are a lot of Marcoses left. There is Imee, Sandro, Matthew, and Vinny who can carry the torch in the future. The Opposition still does not see the writing on the wall. They even went to the extent of remixing Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo, the iconic song composed by Jim Paredes long before his unfortunate “scandal” video of him playing with himself. The song tugs at heartstrings but that’s all it’s good for. The rap segment on the bridge actually contradicts the message of the song because it implies that we are in another dark period in our history.
The fact is, EDSA wasn’t a revolution of the people. It was a poetic grab by an opposing power bloc favored by the Americans. Martial Law was the consequence of former Senator Ninoy Aquino flirting with the left by waking it from its slumber and tasking Joma Sison to lead it. Now Sison is also dead and in an urn in Utrecht. Leni Robredo, still the titular head of the Opposition, notably did not make an appearance in any of the rallies organized yesterday. Why? We have no clue. We have three movies competing amongst the public for validation this week; Oras De Peligro, Ako si Ninoy, and Martyr or Murderer. The debate seemingly continues without the people realizing it has been resolved with Marcos winning the Presidency.
Our political dysfunction is our downfall and this is why we aren’t as progressive as our ASEAN neighbors. It is also a mindset problem, evidently. Filipinos are wired differently. This stems from the Spanish and American influence over our society. It is always a game of one-upmanship among Pinoys which promotes crab mentality. There always needs to be alipins who will serve the rich. Contrast this with China whose Great Leap Forward has resulted in a society that sees Pinoys going to the mainland to work as domestic helpers. Before that, Filipinos sought work mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore. Even this wasn’t enough to motivate us to pressure government for reforms. It is actually a monumental indignity.
The future does not look bright because the premier university in the country is a hotbed of misguided activism. The University of the Philippines (UP) should be supplying government with the talent needed for nation-building. Instead we have activists who take advantage of the system by either entering the academe or government where they are corrupted by the system. They have no measurable impact and are not change agents. They, instead, end up being the problem instead of being the solution. It’s a vicious cycle.
I was 20 years old when Marcos was ousted. I’m 57 now and nothing has changed. Actually, it has gotten worse. I don’t expect change to come in the time I have left on this earth. I’m wary of the younger generation because they are more obsessed with fame and personal validation, do not have the courage to back their principles, and are emotional and psychological weaklings. Our susceptibility and beholdenness to Western liberal ideas is what caused this. We have become a nation of manlets and feminists who have no clue of what it takes to build a strong nation.",Politics
Will Ombudsman Samuel Martires Face Impeachment For Suspending NIA Administrator Benny Antiporda? (Part Two),https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/will-ombudsman-samuel-martires-face-impeachment-for-suspending-nia-administrator-benny-antiporda-part-two/,"In the first part of this series of articles on Ombudsman Samuel Martires’ six month suspension order against NIA Administrator Benny Antiporda I said I would delve into the details of the complaint filed against him and the complaint he filed against his agency’s allegedly erring subordinates.
There are two sides of this issue which must be highlighted. On one hand, there is the NIA employee’s side where they claim to be oppressed by NIA Administrator Antiporda. On the other hand, there is Antiporda’s side where he claims that NIA employees complaints is really an attempt to foil his efforts to discipline the ranks and root our corruption in his agency.
(Given that Ombudsman Martires is said to be a staunch enemy of corruption in government, one could assume that he would have looked into Antiporda’s complaint first before entertaining the harassment complaint lodged by the NIA employees. But that is not what happened and casual onlookers might be given to thinking that Ombudsman Martires sided with NIA employees accused of throwing a plunderous amount of government money.)
I have seen situations such as this several times over in the past when I was consulting for various cabinet secretaries from the time of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to even the time of former President Rodrigo Duterte.
This happened with then DOT Secretary Richard Gordon, where a union of government employees threatened him with corruption complaints after he had implemented reforms and disciplined government employees belonging to the union.
Ditto for former Agriculture Secretary Luis “Cito” Lorenzo and former HUDCC Chairman Mike Defensor where, again, government employee unions protested some manner of oppression or violation of their rights as employees.
I can’t remember the particulars of how each “union led” fight against government Department and Agency heads played out. But I remember it being said that lazy, incompetent, and corrupt government employees were eventually suspended, terminated, or reassigned elsewhere.
Harassed NIA Employees?
On the face of Martires suspension order against Antiporda, it was made to seem that employees had raised the issue of whether the latter should sit as THE ADMINISTRATOR of NIA. Further on, it alleged that because of this, Antiporda engaged in “retaliatory tactics” against employees who questioned his authority. The order enumerates the so-called tactics as:
Ombudsman Martires’ order claims that “After a careful evaluation of the records, this Office finds that among the respondents, Respondent BENNY D. ANTIPORDA’s guilt is strong and the case against him involve Grave Misconduct, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and Oppression, which may warrant his removal from the service.”
Thing is, the complaints against Antiporda sounds to me pretty much like the lament of government employees in other agencies who are battling the head of their agency after they had become the subject of disciplinary measures.
Where’s The Meat?
As I was reading Ombudsman Martires’ suspension order against Antiporda, I was hoping to find some mention of the evidence supporting the allegations made by the employees but couldn’t find any.
So, just on the basis of the Martires’ order, the public reading it would not be able to see for themselves if indeed there was “careful evaluation” and would just have to trust his word — which is fair enough, I suppose.
Then again, as I pointed out in the first article in this series, the statement from NIA Employees Association of the Philippines denying involvement in the complaint against Antiporda would make it seem that the order stems from at least one fictitious complainant.
If there were evidence, perhaps it would be in the complaint against Antiporda and my sources claim that they couldn’t find the complaint. Which leads me to ask, is the complaint so confidential that Antiporda himself wasn’t even furnished a copy of it before he was suspended?
Are officials like Antiporda not allowed to exercise their right to face their accusers and refute their accusations?
Were NIA Employees Harassed or Did They Raise Issues Against Antiporda’s Appointment and File Complaints To Evade Investigation?
Two months before Ombudsman Martires issued a six month suspension order against Antiporda, the NIA Administrator filed charges against officials of the NIA for various offenses, including violations of the anti-graft law.
Sources say Antiporda’s complaint was not acted upon whereas it took Ombudsman Martires just five (5) days to issue a suspension order that presumably would protect from further harassment one dubious complainant and several complainants who themselves were the subject of Antiporda’s complaint
It must be noted that the suspension order against Antiporda listed as complainants the “officers and members of the NIA Employees Association of the Phils (NIAEASP), (Cudal), (Raymundo) and a NIA concerned employee.
Antiporda asked the Ombudsman to “conduct further investigation and to file the appropriate criminal and administrative cases against (Atty Cudal) who is the Acting Chief Legal and Atty. Mary Annabelle Cruz-Domingo” both of the NIA Legal Division. The complaint signed by Antiporda was received by the Ombudsman on September 15, 2022.
The charges include: gross inexcusable negligence, violation of the standards of professionalism; and inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of functions. The case stemmed from the NIA lawyers’ alleged mishandling of a case where NIA lost a staggering P206 million to Green Asia Construction and Development Corporation.
Antiporda suspected that Atty. Cudal who was Acting Manager of the Legal Services deliberately moved to “abandon the case and let the same be handled by novice lawyer Cruz-Domingo so that in the event that NIA loses the case,” it can only be blamed on Atty. Cruz-Domingo.
According to Antiporda, Cudal “orchestrated that NIA will ultimately lose the case, and even made sure that the award of the CIAC (Construction Industry Arbitration Commission) will be executed at the most expedient way, which is the loss of legal remedies on the part of NIA.”
Antiporda explained in his complaint that “Had they made an effort to peruse the Rule of Court and the Rules of Procedure of CIAC, which both of them should have done, they could have easily known that the correct recourse is a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.”
Further on he says that “Atty. Cudal’s culpability is also undoubted. Albeit he issued a Notice to Explain and thereafter filed an administrative complaint against Atty. Cruz-Domingo after the erroneous filing of a petition for Certiorari without his approval, such actions are already after the fact and are obviously done as mere afterthought intended to save himself from blame.”
In his complaint, Antiporda further explains “As the legal manager, he (Cudal) could have acted with prudence and sedulity from the time his office received the Notice of Award from CIAC ordering NIA to pay Php 205,958,119.77. Considering the amount involved, the case should have merited his urgent and full attention.”
Michelle Raymundo, on the other hand, is the subject of a separate complaint filed by Antiporda with the Office of the Ombudsman on October 18, 2022 for “betrayal of public interest… in relation to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, habitual illegal use of a government vehicle, habitual drunkenness, discourtesy and maltreatment, grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a public officer.
Raymundo is the former Board Secretary of the NIA and as such, was issued an official vehicle, which she used for her personal use and beyond office hours to attend to regular drinking sessions with her friends and colleagues. Likewise, Raymundo is accused of maltreating her drivers.",Politics
CIA hijacks Philippine foreign policy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/cia-hijacks-philippine-foreign-policy/,"The Philippines is now focused on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), with the expanded agreement covering access to an additional four Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) facilities and the expansion of an airstrip in the Balabac Island group in Palawan. It was Philippine Ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez who made the announcement, not the President and not even Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo.
President Bongbong Marcos is supposed to be the chief architect of foreign policy but there are many who are inclined to believe that Romualdez is in-charge, vice Manalo, who is also unabashedly, pro-US.
The Philippines and the US recently concluded a two-plus-two one-on-one meeting between US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with their Philippine counterparts, Enrique Manalo and Carlito Galvez last March. This was also under the auspices of Romualdez but what observers noted was while the US was able to obtain much concessions from the Philippines, the latter wasn’t able to receive the same in return, primarily on the efforts of the Philippines to access a bigger piece of America’s market. The US betrayed the Philippines again.
Did Ambassador Babe Romualdez fight for the Philippine interest as hard as he fights for US military interests in the Philippines?
Filipinos Collateral Damage for US Interest
While Marcos continues to enjoy popular support coming off his record win at the polls in May 2022, critical-thinking Filipinos are wary of his pivot to the US given the risk involved in provoking retaliation from China through increased tensions in the disputed waters in the South China Sea and the fact that China is the top trading partner of the country, and major partner in infrastructure development.
All of these developments are coming on the heels of the perceived weakening of the US with its failures in Iraq and Afghanistan and the largely ineffective sanctions on Russia, which has been relying on the advice of Iran for ways to go around the American ban given they have been under the same regime since 1979.
It doesn’t help that the US trade sanctions on China have had the effect of fueling anti-American sentiment in key regions around the world. China has brokered a semblance of peace between the Saudis and the Iranians. The same is true with Syria. There are also African countries which have announced their disengagement with their former colonial rulers such as France. There have been widespread protests in France and Germany against NATO support for Ukraine and the continuing escalation of inflation in the continent due to US and NATO sanctions on Russian energy exports.
By far the largest elephant in the room which remains unaddressed is the bombing of the Nord Stream pipeline and subsequent expose by prominent American journalist Seymour Hersh that the US was behind it.
How Many Filipinos Will Die for America?
The Philippines was on the wrong side of history when the Pacific War broke out, leading to over a million Filipinos perishing. But those were circumstances beyond its control because it was the subject of horse trading between the declining Spanish empire and the rising American empire.
Pax Britannia ended after World War II. Pax Americana began with the Monroe Doctrine and continued with the ascendancy of the US during the Cold War and the fight against the spread of communism in Asia.
Another million Filipinos died in World War 2, Japan and America fought each other in the Philippines and obliterated Manila.
While America continues projecting itself as fighting for good versus evil, it has created far more deaths and destructions since WW2, and had turned nations into warzones many remaining so to this day. American economic and financial hegemony through the dollar is ending and this development is too serious to just sweep under the rug and say that in the end, America will still emerge triumphant.
But we need to keep a close watch on the pro-American cabal surrounding BBM. They have his ear and he has been dancing to the tune they’ve been playing even before his inauguration. If the government and the AFP isn’t going to protect the people as provided for in the Constitution, then we, the people, have no other choice but to protect ourselves.
Is Babe Romualdez the Filipino Edward Lansdale?
One can’t help but compare Romualdez to Edward Lansdale, the former US Air Force officer who was the Central Intelligence Agency’s resident chief in the Philippines after World War II. It was Lansdale who engineered the rise of Ramon Magsaysay to the Presidency. Many believe he was also behind Magsaysay’s death in a plane crash in Cebu.
Lansdale also worked with the AFP in counter-insurgency operations against the Huks. Lansdale was believed to have recruited Ninoy Aquino as a CIA operative. The same is true with Ninoy’s close friend, Max Soliven, who attended college at Fordham University in New York. Soliven and Romualdez became close after the Marcos’ fall from power.
The crowning move, as it seems, has been secured, with the announcement that President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. will be embarking on a working visit to the US in May with a meeting in the White House with key officials led by President Joe Biden and top members of his Cabinet.",Politics

Marcuse’s Great Refusal must itself be Refused,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/marcuse-great-refusal/,"I mentioned earlier that Neo-Marxist Herbert Marcuse is one of the greatest influences on today’s Woke movement. He is one of the Frankfurt School, which assumed Communism had not yet taken over the world because of the protection of western culture. So instead of looking at what’s so good about western culture, Marcuse instead urges attacks on that culture to take it down. In his works, he created many of the modern gaslighting techniques that are used by the far left and Woke movement today to achieve this goal.
In his work, Repressive Tolerance, he said that only the political left should be given total tolerance and freedom, while anything right-wing (even if not actually right-wing) should be demonized or censored. So he helped build up the illusion that the left/progressive=always good, right/conservative=always evil. Marcuse also not only promoted the deprivation of free speech from those made out to be “evil,” but he also advocated trying to prevent them from thinking certain thoughts, basically thought policing, which leads to outright bullying of people in the same manner as a Maoist Struggle Session.
This is happening on the Internet these days. Anyone saying that trans people are not following reality and that sex is biologically based and observed, not assigned, is considered “right-wing” and racist and are sometimes banned or shut down. In truth, left-wing elements can also lead to tyranny, which was demonstrated in the French Revolution and many other cases where the overthrowers themselves became despotic once in power. Today, it could reach the point where Wokes would call for “based” people to be killed.
I believe that in Marcuse’s books, One-Dimensional Man and The Great Refusal, he claims that the prosperity of the capitalist western world and the recreation afforded people under this are merely illusions. This is the classic Marxist conspiracy theory that one centralized power is using the capitalist world to keep people docile or satiated enough that they could not do the work of Marxism. So Marcuse’s solution is to “refuse” the western world, overthrow the enjoyable life offered by it and embrace the violence of Marxism.
But isn’t it that people content with their lives that they don’t overthrow societies is a good thing? Doesn’t that mean that such a society is meeting people’s needs and life is better there than ever before?
I believe that Marcuse doesn’t understand the western market-based liberal world. This world enabled many kinds of recreation like hobbies: scale modeling, toy collecting, role-playing games, science fiction and fantasy literature and video games. Even poorer people can enjoy these things now. Music and art also flourished under it. The market-based world made food plentiful and living more enjoyable. And people decide what they want to enjoy, it is not determined for them by others. I see nothing illusory or wrong about this. None of these would flourish under a communist society (well, when Russian band Alyans came out with the synthpop song Na Zare in 1987, I guess it was because of Gorbachev’s ‘glasnost’ at the time).
But why does Marcuse see it as illusory? Simple: the non-illusory world for him is the Communist one. He fails to accept that people really enjoy and have relatively better lives under a world where goods are traded, not handed out, and where individuals have the right over their own lives. It seems to me that Marcuse wants all work and no play – which makes Herb a dull boy.
Marcuse also promoted infiltrating popular culture, using it to destroy the Western world from within, something I believe is drawn from Antonio Gramsci. Part of this is the hijacking of fictional properties (Lord of the Rings, Marvel comics, etc.) to try and insert their Marxist messages in them and try to get revolution going. Good thing some people have seen it and are calling it out.
I mentioned before that American communist and Black Lives Matter figure Angela Davis was Marcuse’s protege. She carries on the attempts to paint and gaslight the free, market-based world as “evil” and everyone who supports it as oppressors. Many critical theories, including Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory and more, carry on this program.
Marcuse advocated for sexual liberation (his book Eros and Civilization), and there’s an irony here. It’s not really for sexual enjoyment only. Marcuse and other people, applying Sigmund Freud’s ideas, saw that sex was something that society was often prudish about. For example, most parents would caution children against casual sex. Marcuse and other Neo-Marxists saw this as something to get the children riled up about so they can overthrow western society. Hey, kids, if your parents keep banning you from having sex, then you should rebel against them! And, when rebelling, kids, join us Marxists! That’s what you see affecting LGBTs and leading to something like Drag Queen Story Hour.
In true Marxist fashion, Marcuse takes something and tries to convince you that it is other than what it really is. He claims big oppression exists where there is none or little and reverses good and evil. He comes out as a wannabe dictator who is wrapped up in his own world and could not see the truth. Or, he is like the really old-fashioned people who believe that young people should not be allowed free time or recreation but instead should be conscripted for work elsewhere. I wonder if Marcuse was merely jealous of people who were happy with their lives and all his writings are just a projection of it.
James Lindsay however wondered if Marcuse would have thought differently had he known about the failure of Mao-era China and its many deaths. Marcuse praised China in his writing, but he did not know yet about the millions killed by famine, the Red Guard and other communism-inspired actions, since news about this came after his death. One could only speculate, but certainly this history of China should be kept in the annals and carefully studied as among the bad examples all should avoid.
Recently, Marcuse was mentioned in a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) document titled “Knowledge-driven actions: transforming higher education for global sustainability.” The document seeks to require universities to teach sustainability. It sounds good at first, but Lindsay said that “sustainability” is the new tyranny, because requirements will be forced onto people. Anyone who refuses to follow will be imposed with social credit sanctions similar to what is happening in China. Lindsay also expressed his shock at seeing Marcuse mentioned in a UN document, and the document even mentioned how riots occurred because of him. And yet the document does not condemn Marcuse’s part in those events; instead it seeks to apply Marcuse’s ideas further, in a sense like, maybe we’ll get it right this time. I doubt they will. But it also means that Marxists are in the UN and are going to make a mess of things.
Some will point to problems with the capitalist world and I agree there are some, it’s not perfect. But the real world itself isn’t perfect anyway. And Marcuse’s ideas are not the solution; they are the germ of bad ideas that will only make things worse. Like most attempts at Utopia, his proposal is likely to lead to Hell. Enjoying ourselves in this market-based economy is not wrong and only needs to be tempered with the application of values and personal responsibility. The sexual liberation Marcuse (although I do recognize other figures like Alfred Kinsey and Wilhelm Reich) promotes will only spread more perversion and has been used to promote cognitively dissonant ideas, such as transgender ideology.
Lindsay however points out a seeming self-contradiction in Marcuse’s work. Marcuse himself warns about the danger of being right-wing when one is in power. However, when you follow Marcuse’s ideas, you will inevitably become right-wing. So Lindsay implies that Marcuse has either forgotten his own ideas or opposing himself. Perhaps that’s why Paolo Freire, yet another crackpot, suggests always going left even when you are in power. Keep doing the revolution even if you’ve already done it. Freire’s ideas are messing American education up as result, but that’s a story for another day.
Marcuse is one of the enemies in Karl Popper’s The Open Society and Its Enemies, the ones we should not tolerate because they are exactly the ones whose ideas and actions seek the destruction and takeover of the comfortable world that we know. The Great Refusal must be turned on Marcuse; his work and ideas must be challenged and blocked, although we can study them as cautionary tales. Of course, there are his cohorts in the Frankfurt School like Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and other bad idea makers like Gramsci and Gyorgy Lukacs. We must also do the same to ideas by Rousseau, Hegel, Mao and more, anyone whose ideas have imagined that the way to the perfect world is to destroy the classical liberalist and market-based free world.",Politics
"Religion and politics: an alliance of money, influence, and power",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/religion-and-politics-an-alliance-of-money-influence-and-power/,"If there is one event that sent chilling shockwaves to the whole world in 2022, aside from the Russian special military operations in Ukraine and the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign as the head of state of the United Kingdom, it would definitely be the assassination of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan, a country renowned for its public safety and pacifist image with virtually no recent history of gun-related violence, had witnessed its former head of government shot with an improvised firearm in broad daylight during the campaign trail. The perpetrator was previously a member of the Japanese Self Defense Forces, which is essentially to their Armed Forces because the current constitution inhibits Japan to organize its military. His words demonstrated the unholy alliance between religion and politics behind the curtains. This ended up opening new wounds regarding organized religion, remarkable considering that Japan isn’t even a deeply religious country in comparison to other nations.
The assassin’s primary motive for killing the renowned prime minister stems from the fact that the late leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) supported and received political backing from the Unification Church. This South Korean organized movement is labelled as a religious cult by some Japanese academes due to the organization’s use of unscrupulous methods to influence its members. Members of the Unification Church are compelled to purchase various goods at ridiculous prices to boost their “spiritual sales”. This forced some of its members to sell personal properties and even bankrupted numerous families including that of the perpetrator’s. These sales are remitted to Seoul to further expand the religion overseas. With a massive pool of financial resources gained from crippling Japanese families, politicians went close to the Unification Church for political support in the form of votes during the elections. With these politicians providing political recognition, the religious movement enjoyed blanket protection from having to answer to such controversies.
Aside from the Unification Church, Japan also had a horrendous history with another religious cult, the Aum Shinrikyo. This religious movement was the primary culprit for the 1995 terrorist attack in Tokyo’s subway, which had injured thousands and killed fourteen individuals. Sarin, a lethal nerve agent, was used by the perpetrators. The organization was also implicated in the murder of a lawyer and his family in 1989, as his actions as a religious cult buster was perceived as an existential threat for Aum Shinrikyo. In addition, the Matsumoto sarin attack, which served as a precursor to the 1995 sarin bioterrorism, was also linked to the aforementioned group. In the end, the Japanese government has decided to hang the perpetrators, including their founder, Shoko Asahara.
Religion and politics have a long, intertwined history in various parts of the world. Starting with the predominantly Islamic region of the Middle East, the commercial, scientific, and military successes of the Saracens through the formation of a caliphate eventually led Islam as its primary religion. Fundamental differences between its preachers and believers created a significant rift between its major sects, where Sunni Islam and Shia Islam ended up flexing their muscles in a race to gain influence in the world’s largest powder keg. This can be observed with the Saud family in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confronting the ayatollahs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Geopolitics plays a significant role in the Middle Eastern Cold War, but differences in their understanding and interpretation of the Quran adds fuel to the fire.
Despite its seven decade-long history of state atheism, the Middle East’s northern neighbor has also had its own share of religion being intertwined with national politics, which can be observed even today. Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, actively promoted the profession of atheism to its satellite states in the Warsaw Pact. However, unlike Communism, Eastern Orthodoxy stood the test of time, as more Russians are professing their faith to the Orthodox Church. Even though organized religions in Russia are compelled to declare and pay taxes, the administration of President Vladimir Putin provided tax incentives to the Russian Orthodoxy, which in turn supported his political career.
Russia’s immediate European neighbors are no strangers to religion and politics. Western and Central Europe witnessed the creation of the Holy Roman Empire, which unified European territories who share the Catholic faith. European kings and monarchs lead and govern through this idea of the divine right, which legitimizes the political power held by these monarchies. This gave birth to the excesses of the aristocracy and the clergy. Augustinian friar Martin Luther rejected the practices of the Roman Catholic Church through his Ninety-five Theses, most specially these indulgences that have filled the pockets of priests, bishops, and cardinals. The birth of the Protestant faith eventually led to the Thirty Years’ War in the next century, where it resulted to the formation of the Treaty of Westphalia. This Westphalian system forms the backbone of exclusive territorial sovereignty in international relations. Needless to say, the Thirty Years’ War earmarked the emergence of Protestant Netherlands at the expense of Catholic Spain in the European continent, according to Ray Dalio’s “The Changing World Order”.
As a predominantly Catholic country in Asia Pacific, the Philippines also has a lengthy history with organized religion. During the Spanish colonial period, the geographical distance between Madrid and Manila hampered efficient administration of the colony. This left the Governor-General with no choice but to depend on Spanish priests to act and administer the country on behalf of the state. With discontent brewing in the Philippine society, these Spanish priests were eventually confronted with armed revolts. This confrontation unfortunately placed the blame on secular Filipino priests in the late 1870’s, with the public execution of Gomburza.
Despite the inviolable separation of Church and State stipulated in the 1987 Constitution where there will be no state religion, Filipino politicians continue to associate themselves with various religious entities and groups, most specially during elections. After all, these political candidates direly need these votes to propel themselves to power. Numerous politicians are seen cozying up with these religious movements, as their arms are being raised by their respective founders, where these public endorsements serve as guarantees for their victory. Such has been the brand of Philippine democracy.
Freedom of religion has been a core tenet in liberal democracies and is considered as a fundamental human right, where individuals and communities are given the liberty to practice their respective beliefs. Through religion, virtues and values are taught that would aid in having individuals develop a sound moral compass. This is greatly beneficial to the society as a whole because well-guided citizens serve as the foundation for strong yet inclusive societal institutions to emerge. However, religion should never be allowed to transform into a means to feed the greed of the powerful, the influential, and the wealthy. Unfortunately, nobody knows how to hold these organizations, backers, and associates liable and accountable for these deplorable consequences.",Politics
Making SUMBONG to a foreign court like the International Criminal Court is a childish Yellowtard stunt destined to fail,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/making-sumbong-to-a-foreign-court-like-the-international-criminal-court-is-a-childish-yellowtard-stunt-destined-to-fail/,"Seems like members of the Yellowtard Communist-Axis are now copping flak over raising the dead initiative that is the “investigation” the so-called “International Criminal Court” are presuming to mount in the Philippines. The dysfunctional thinking within this inbred community, it seems, goes like this: If we can’t have our way within our own justice system, let’s take our case to a foreign court!
Such a class act, these people.
They keep insisting that the ICC has the “authority” to prosecute individuals for international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, regardless of where the crimes were committed or the nationality of the accused or victims. Not surprising then that more than a few nations view this as a violation of their sovereignty and choose not to participate in the ICC. To be fair, the question of who or what exactly grants this “authority” is the elephant in the room everyone seems to be ignoring. Then again, “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition do have quite the history of cherry picking the factual pillars of the positions they take.
The fact is, the Philippines risks huge loss of reputation if it subjects itself to an ICC “investigation”. In southeast Asia it is only the Philippines and East Timor that had, at one time or another, been parties to the Rome Statute. Not that there’s anything wrong with being an African country but being the first Southeast Asian nation to succumb to the “authority” of the ICC will make Philippines come across like one of those dysfunctional states in that continent. It seems, members of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis are willing to burn an entire house down just to kill a couple of rats. And then there is the issue of convincing an electorate that said rats actually are rats.
The fact alone that the Philippines sits alongside a minor country like East Timor in a list of ICC subjects already says something. The Philippines, after all is often regarded as one of the “major” ASEAN nation members. Indeed, even that distinction is coming into question as relative newbies like Vietnam and even Cambodia start to outrank the Philippines on many development metrics. The Philippines’ position as a respected and “major” ASEAN state is therefore under threat as it is. An ICC investigation is the last thing it needs and one that it can easily opt out of.
The Yellowtard and communist leaders of the Philippine Opposition need to be challenged to reveal what they really seek to achieve by inviting the ICC to intervene in their country’s domestic affairs, specially considering that the Philippines has a fully functional (albeit imperfect) justice system. Do they really have the broader and longer-term interests of the Filipino people in mind? Or is it really just a return to power with a vengeance that is what is really motivating this latest circus they perpetrate? Filipinos need to find out once and for all.",Politics
SO WHAT if the Marcos family is rich?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/so-what-if-the-marcos-family-is-rich/,"Is being rich a crime? If so where’s the legislation to support that assertion? There have been accusations and investigations that the Marcos family acquired much of their wealth illegally during Ferdinand Marcos’s presidency from 1965 to 1986, through means such as embezzlement, bribery, and kickbacks. However, the exact extent of any illegal activity has never been conclusively proven and the family has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Despite a “new order” supposedly established when the Yellowtards and communists won a so-called “revolution” in 1986 and subsequent governments toeing the line of those “revolutionaries”, no more than flaccid legal legs (if any) prop up what amount to mere propaganda surrounding the family’s “ill gotten wealth”.
Indeed, efforts to recover the wealth that the Marcos family is alleged to have acquired illegally have been ongoing for several decades. After the fall of “the Marcos regime” in 1986, the Philippine government established the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) to investigate and recover the allegedly stolen assets. The PCGG has filed several cases in the Philippines and abroad, including the United States, to recover assets believed to have been acquired through illegal means. The effort to stand up viable cases against the family in courts much more recover these supposedly “stolen” funds have largely been a failure.
Today, all that is left of this effort is pathetic propaganda. The strategy to keep the case relevant seems to amount to no more than repeated slogans and chants issued over more than a few “activist” spectacles. Ultimately, proof that these too have been ineffective culminated over three successive Philippine national elections over which the Yellowtards and their communist allies suffered catastrophic losses in succession.
Today, the pathetic effort of the Opposition to seize political power in the Philippines using dishonest means can easily be encapsulated in the sophomoric rhetoric contained in the tweets of the Opposition’s keyboard activists such as this one…
Indeed, even before one gets to the flawed point being made by noted Yellowtard “thought leader” Gerry Cacanindin, there is a wealth of outright falsehoods within the tweet that any schoolgirl can easily unpack. For one (among many more), those service vehicles that shuttled the Philippine delegation to the airport are likely to have been provided by the organisers of the event. In any case it is unlikely that Cacanindin had mounted sufficient research to at least check the facts he used to spin this ululation.
The Marcos-is-Evil narrative came about because it is easy to build an Opposition narrative around Victimhood Strawmen. A prayerful martyred “good guy” beating an “evil dictator” using non-violent means (though hardly original) is easy for a nation of lazy thinkers to wrap their heads around — certainly an easier “challenge” to run with as a national ideology than the idea that it takes brains, talent, and work to actually succeed. Thus Yellowtardism was born and the real Dark Ages descended upon Philippine society.
Evidently, Filipinos have learned enough about the dishonest modus operandi of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis of Intellectual Bankruptcy to ignore their brain-dead contributions to the national discourse.",Politics
American militarism and Filipino naivete creates no pragmatism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/american-militarism-and-filipino-naivete-creates-no-pragmatism/,"Prior to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s state visit to Japan, Filipino netizens reacted with mixed emotions about the approval and expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Supporters of the EDCA and its expansion quickly pointed out that cooperation with the United States in responding against counter-terrorism and natural calamities would be greatly beneficial for the Philippines. On the other hand, pundits point out that this would escalate tensions and raise the stakes in the geopolitical dynamics of the Asia-Pacific, mentioning that American saber-rattling may agitate the People’s Republic of China (PROC) and prompt it to adopt a more aggressive and bellicose stance. What is definitely at play in the Asia-Pacific, and what should the Philippines be cautious about?
The geopolitical realities of the Asia-Pacific during the 1890’s were completely different, with a significantly weakening Spanish control of the Philippines. To its west was French Indochina, and to its south were the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. On its north was an emerging expansionist great power in Japan. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the Philippine archipelago was officially under American occupation. As a way to differentiate Washington from its European colonial powers in London and Paris, the American government adopted a policy called benevolent assimilation, where the United States attempted to create a Philippines in its own image and likeness, most specially in its political systems and institutions.
After the harrowing end of the Second World War, Manila and Washington oversaw the signing of a mutual defense treaty, firmly placing the Philippines within American orbit. This treaty allows the United States to issue a declaration of war towards any aggressor state to the Philippines and vice versa, despite being subject to the approval of their respective Congresses. Paired with the Military Bases Agreement, such commitments proved useful for the United States, where Subic and Clark served as American staging points during the Vietnam War. However, the aforementioned agreement became too unpopular, which resulted in it not being renewed by the Philippine Senate in 1991.
Before 1991 came to an end, a surprising development changed the world order with the Soviet Union’s dissolution. American political scientist Francis Fukuyama mentioned in his book “The End of History and the Last Man” that the humankind will eventually transform and adopt liberal democracy as its government system. This can be true for previously Soviet-aligned or incorporated countries like the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia, but it seems to be the complete opposite when one considers the biggest elephant in the room: China.
China’s transformation began under the tutelage of their paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, who famously said that getting rich is glorious. Economic reforms went underway, where policies connected to “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” were adopted. With reduced government oversight in economic development, creation of special economic zones, and lifting of economic restrictions, the People’s Republic was able to single-handedly lift millions of Chinese out of poverty. These resulted in China dethroning Japan as the largest Asian economy, with a massive 1.4 billion market and a burgeoning export-oriented manufacturing industry to back its tremendous size.
Learning from the failures of the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was relatively conservative in enforcing political reforms. He pushed for less concentration of political power and influence, which was a complete opposite to his predecessor’s personality cult. He adopted a two-term limit for Chinese leaders, giving them a maximum of ten years, which he, himself, has followed. His successors in Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao served for two consecutive terms, until Xi Jinping abolished these limits, where he is currently serving his third, five-year term. Despite the rising authoritarianism of the police state in China, Deng Xiaoping’s foresight and pragmatism can be succinctly summarized with his “Black cat, white cat” proverb.
With a rising China and a stagnating America, confrontation in one way or another is inevitable. American investor Ray Dalio in his book “The Changing World Order” highlighted a number of historical instances when the ruling power was eventually challenged and overtaken by a different nation-state. The first example is when the Dutch emerged victorious in dethroning the Spanish during the 17th century with the Thirty Years’ War. The second example is when the British became too wealthy and powerful for Amsterdam to confront, where through the Napoleonic Wars, London became the most dominant power. The third example is when the Americans extended their influence to many parts of the world, with Britain eventually acquiescing due to its tremendous losses in both World Wars. All these instances have a common denominator in these power transitions, which are unimaginable bloodshed and damages to properties.
Unfortunately, geopolitical realities that continually challenge the status quo never change. For China, accessing the Pacific Ocean lies on the subjugation of the First Island Chain, which includes the territorial waters of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Aside from being the third largest economy, Japan is considered as a nuclear latent country, where it has all the capabilities of developing, mass-producing, and delivering nuclear weapons. Despite its measly population of slightly less than 25 million, Taiwan employs conscription and is a strategically important nation-state, with its virtual monopoly of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Considering these factors, the Philippines is undoubtedly the weakest link. Manila doesn’t have a massive economy, nor does it have nuclear capabilities. Unlike Taiwan, conscription is not employed in the Philippines and has no resources nor material products that can come close to the strategic value of these technologically advanced chips. With these realities, why does the Philippines need to be involved in a possible military conflict that Filipinos have virtually nothing to gain from?
As a regional hegemon, the United States has maximized its chances for survival. Despite this, they are employing a Cold War strategy in confronting China, through “containment” as Washington has aligned the common interests of Tokyo, Taipei, Manila, New Delhi, and Canberra. Undoubtedly, an arms race is brewing in Asia Pacific, raising tensions in these contested territories. Then-US President Dwight Eisenhower’s words warning the whole world about the dangers of the military-industrial complex might seem proverbial as military conflicts raise the demand and sale of American materiel. This can be observed when stocks of American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon becoming highly profitable. To complicate things further, stockholders of these companies are also members of the US Congress. What kind of cards will the Philippines have under its sleeves if the United States seems to be driven by war profiteering?
Deterring aggression from two superpowers will be a herculean task for any middling power like the Philippines, and it entails a meticulous balancing effort. Stationing American military personnel in Philippine territory by renegotiating EDCA would be a no-brainer to avoid alienating China. Implementation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program should also be observed, while continuous investment in procuring advanced military hardware for the armed forces is a must. To sustainably fund this building up of military capabilities and assets, foreign investors must be allowed to freely own and operate businesses in the country through economic liberalization. After all, a strong, robust economy yields a strong, robust republic.",Politics
Dear Bongbong Marcos: with vindication comes great responsibility!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/dear-bongbong-marcos-with-vindication-comes-great-responsibility/,"Is EDSA still relevant to Filipinos? I was 20 years old at that time and about to graduate from college. I spent my college years protesting against Marcos after Ninoy Aquino’s death in 1983. I was convinced that then President Ferdinand E. Marcos was evil and the Aquinos were good because of what I read in the papers and what our professors lectured to us about how we needed to get our freedoms back.
But I wasn’t a blindly obedient follower. I was born and raised in San Miguel, Manila so I got to see the comings and goings of Apo Lakay and Madame First Lady Imelda Marcos on J.P. Laurel St. We were also allowed to enter Malacañan Park at the other side of the Pasig River, which was the headquarters of the Presidential Security Command on our bikes. This is where Marcos would play golf with his closest associates such as Herminio Disini and Rudy Cuenca. I saw first-hand how Imelda would leave early in the morning onboard the PNR bus she used as her primary vehicle when she was Metro Manila Governor and not return until late at night. The Greater Manila Area then was kept clean by her army of Metro Aides. She treated the expanded capital as part of her household and kept things in order.
The reforms promised by Cory never came and the minute she reneged on her agreement with Doy Laurel, I realized that she wasn’t going to be what she said she would. The Constitutional Commission brought back the Senate and the House of Representatives along with the gridlock and the political dynasties. It was all downhill from there. EDSA wasn’t a revolution. It was a failed coup attempt by then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM), turned successful through American intervention. The plan was for civil disobedience after Cory Aquino lost the snap election to Marcos. Without the coup attempt, it wasn’t likely that Marcos was going to be ousted but the continuing political instability would take its toll on the economy.
Ironically, the same thing happened with Cory after her falling out with Enrile and the disgruntled Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officers who balked at her release of the top leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Without the support of Tabako and the Americans, Cory would’ve been deposed during the 1989 coup attempt. The opposition claims they fought hard for freedom and democracy but nothing much has changed during their time in power. The situation actually got worse.
After 36 years, we have another Marcos as President. Vindication and redemption for their family, true, but the prospects for the average Filipino still remain uncertain as President Bongbong Marcos is more focused on the validation of the geopolitical powers that be to the point that his independent foreign policy is nothing more than a pivot to the US again. The reform which was put in place by his father, by way of the constitutional convention and the adoption of a new constitution was shelved by EDSA but it doesn’t look like Marcos is keen on structural reforms. He won the election by a majority but doesn’t seem to have the sense of urgency to spend the political capital given him by the people to make drastic changes needed to make the country competitive and progressive.
It remains to be seen how China will react to Marcos’ pivot economically. But in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the Chinese white ships are constantly present, increasing tensions as the gray ships of the US Navy conduct patrols and Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) in the areas claimed by China. It remains to be seen what kind of compensation will be given by the US for access to bases in the country and if their support can be counted on in the event China imposes indirect economic sanctions on the country as it did during the Aquino administration. Filipinos are left without an option in the event there is a change in opinion about Marcos’ foreign policy since the opposition is undoubtedly pro-US.
Filipinos still haven’t learned their lessons about how the Americans only exploit their supposed “allies” in the region. We lost Scarborough Shoal China because we relied on American “support” as they negotiated a deal with China. Marcos Sr. was brought down with US support. This, it appears that Marcos Jr. has taken out an insurance policy to ensure that his term will not be cut short by Uncle Sam. Hopefully, we don’t get caught in the middle of a shooting war between the US and China over Taiwan. We should’ve learned our lessons already from our elders who lived through the time when the Americans left the Philippines under Japanese rule. We can only hope that history doesn’t repeat itself.",Politics

It’s not really mind-boggling as it’s always been in the back burner. I’ve been using it at work and I can say that with the right prompt, you get what you need and with a little bit of adjustments, you get your job done faster. Most people think that anyone can use it. This is not the case with prompts. It’s the same case with search engines. If you can’t formulate an accurate search string then you can’t find what you’re looking for.
Last week was interesting because an infographic of possible opposition candidates for the Senate in 2025, surfaced on Twitter.
Then this guy @benign0 got into it with the (in)famous Zyza Nadine Suzara a.k.a. Budget Babe on Twitter, she who supposedly is some kind of budget guru, all because she worked at the Department of Budget Management under Butch Abad during the Aquino administration. What’s funny is just like Opposition “chief economist” JC Punongbayan, both of these morons haven’t worked in the private sector since their college graduation. They’ve been in government as co-terminus appointees; when their boss steps down, they go with him or her. The reason for this is they probably don’t qualify for plantilla positions since again, they don’t have the requisite training and experience. This leads me to conclude they’re just Opposition mouthpieces who are social media savvy; at least they and their comrades think they are.
You know an argument is lost when one of the protagonists resorts to an ad hominem remark. In this case, Suzara tweeted that @benign0 has “small dick energy”, which is a euphemism for accusing him of having a small dick. Of course, this is something she wouldn’t be privy to given she’s not had a carnal encounter of any kind with @benign0.
The third member in our group said that “for a large c*nt, any dick is small” as a reaction to the babe’s remark. Of course the babe found this offensive when out before her. Double standard if you ask me since she expects to get away with being same against a man she’s losing an argument with. If it were me, I wouldn’t have held back considering she doesn’t resemble anything like a babe in reality and it’s obvious that during the lockdown, she did nothing but stock up on carbs, judging by a pic she posted at a wedding she attended.
But the dick that @benign0 is, couldn’t help himself and subsequently posted a meme, depicting the alleged Budget “Babe” in a bad light.
It’s bad when she’s ranged up against someone who’s closer to being a babe than she will ever be. It reminds me of another friend, the person behind We Are Collective, which exposed the true characters of the late Jesse Robredo and his widow former “vice president” Leni “MaDumb” Robredo and why they were really made for each other. Jesse was no hunk and Leni is no babe either but he went to the extent of describing how ugly Leni was in her teens. You can actually see that in her college annual when she graduated from UP. No whitening agents then and no eyebrow threading.
Think of it like the bold komiks found in Recto before where you have the son of the amo going into the maid’s room; huwak Koya, huwak. Maawa ka na Koya.
Bottomline: those in the opposition can dish it out but when faced with a formidable foe, they can’t take it, which is why even with the advent of artificial intelligence, the Opposition will continue to remain as dumb as a doornail. This is why I can’t comprehend why there remains a sector in society that continues to support them. The best explanation I can come up with is they’re also psycho-sociopaths who benefit from the largesse these personalities dispense with.
The refuge of morons is the academe and government which is why it is no wonder our youth are getting dumber and nothing happens in government. Imagine what would’ve happened if MaDumb won again. That would’ve been a combined horror and freak show rolled into one. But at least, the babe has been shut down for now and exposed for what she truly is.",Politics
Philippine Opposition clearly continue to be out of touch with the Filipino masses,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/philippine-opposition-clearly-continue-to-be-out-of-touch-with-the-filipino-masses/,"The morons in the Philippine Opposition continue to discuss and debate about why they continue to lose elections without even taking time out to get feedback from the voter base which wins people elections to begin with. Their efforts to vilify former President Rodrigo Duterte didn’t succeed. Their efforts to vilify the Marcoses succeeded for a time but eventually public opinion shifted because there was no marked change in the state of the Philippines under the Yellowidiots.
It was Duterte who paved the way for the Marcos return to the Presidency because he was the only one who made good on his commitment to bury former President Ferdinand E. Marcos albeit without the pomp and pageantry that his widow former First Lady Imelda wanted. That was Duterte’s compromise. The association of Marcos with Duterte did more good than harm for Duterte as it gave him the support of the Ilokano voting base throughout the country. Whether the loyalists care to admit it or not, Duterte’s assessment of then former Senator Bongbong Marcos was correct. Duterte saw through the weaknesses of Marcos early on which was probably why he didn’t appoint him in his administration and left him to resolve his election protest against Leni. Marcos lost the electoral protest following his alleged defeat in the race for the vice presidency in 2016 but he went on to win the Presidency in 2022. The public made it clear that he did win the Vice-Presidency in 2016.
It would’ve been different if it were a Duterte-Marcos tandem from 2016-2022. Why? Marcos would’ve been able to start on his family’s redemption arc and would’ve been finished by the time he was to step down as Vice-President and run to become Duterte’s successor, with or without his endorsement. But what we’re seeing now is how class origins matter. Duterte wasn’t connected to any of the oligarchs when he ran. Sure, the Gokongweis supported him but the others did not. Duterte has always put the greater majority’s welfare first. He kept the oligarchs in line when he was President. Totally different from Marcos now who has the oligarchs surrounding him in every foreign sojourn.
By far, the biggest policy shift under Marcos’s watch has been the pivot back to the US. China has become aggressive again in the South China Sea. Their ships are only 100 NM away from Pag-Asa. They control Scarborough Shoal as a result of Aquino’s blunder in 2012. The Chinese ignored the Americans then. What’s Marcos’s guarantee that the US will unconditionally support the Philippines should China begin imposing indirect economic sanctions as it did during the Aquino administration? Therein lies the proverbial rub.
At the same time, Marcos does not have the kamay na bakal approach when it comes to the cartels that are driving food prices up. This is why no amount of interest rate hikes will stop inflation from galloping along. Marcos has to come down hard on the cartels as his father Apo Lakay did during his time. Then he has to adjust the  agriculture policy to be more in tune with what’s actually the practical strategy. There isn’t much land left to distribute for agrarian reform. The smaller-sized farms aren’t viable which is why production routinely fails to meet the demand of our more rapidly-growing population. Demand for housing is competing for the land to be used for food production. The agrarian reform beneficiaries can’t modernize fast enough and the government bureaucrats are doing nothing to fast-track the needed modernization.
It can’t be all propaganda as the public continues to suffer from the impact of high food prices. The public doesn’t have much of an alternative because there is  no credible opposition that presents viable options for them. Marcos has the political capital and opportunity to leave a lasting legacy of his Presidency if only he had the same vision as Apo Lakay, with the required adjustments which take into account the changed environment. There’s no time to waste but even with the control of the legislature, the system is still gridlocked. This is why the political structure should be changed.",Politics

During the long political campaign, the opposition tried to sell the specter of the past resurrecting to haunt us. That was non sequitur.

The opposition propagandists threw their shadow on the wall and were terrified by it.
He then added an interesting anecdote…
Last week, my doctor reported to me he recommended several patients (all Leni [Robredo] supporters) to seek professional help for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I asked him what the symptoms of that disorder might be. Extreme anxiety, he said.
So, first, the Opposition mounted campaigns inspired by the products of their insanity from 2016 to 2022. Then they fall into a deep anxiety induced by the post-trauma stress they suffered following their loss in a seminal election. What next?
It seems all this had created a dangerous bunch of people. This is evident in what we see today — stragglers whose approach to coming to terms with their loss comes in the form of denying said loss. Rather than pick up the pieces, they scrounge around for scapegoats, lash out at strawmen, and turn blind eyes to information that offer factual answers to their questions. To these deranged people, their loss was not a result of playing well but more an outcome of “evil” people depriving them of a win they believe they are entitled to.
This is the sort of thinking that creates extremists, terrorists, and, ultimately, homicidal maniacs. Perhaps then, someone like Faith Nester Poltic, a nurse employed by the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center who allegedly issued a call to her fellow nurses to kill former First Lady Imelda Marcos, is an embodiment of the crisis we all knew was coming on the back of the mass trauma of the Philippine Opposition.
Filipinos need a smart and modern Opposition and not the intellectually-bankrupt zealots they are subject to today. What might possibly replace these political cockroaches? Evidently, we now know this is an extremely difficult question to answer — because we have seen how even three consecutive electoral losses still fail to induce long-overdue reflection among the most eminent of Opposition “thought leaders”. It takes, after all, informed minds to imagine a new character to build following traumatic setbacks. Perhaps if the Opposition learn to be strong and stop being such whiners, there may still be hope of a much-needed evolution in their thinking.",Politics
Should we continue to write about Leni Robredo even after she was buried in the the 2022 elections?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/should-we-continue-to-write-about-leni-robredo-even-after-she-was-buried-in-the-the-2022-elections/,"Absolutely. Leni Robredo was leader of the Philippines Opposition since 2016 after her pal Mar Roxas was crushed by Rodrigo Duterte in the 2016 presidential elections. She continued to remain in Opposition campaign mode even as “vice president” from 2016 through 2022 going as far as slinging mud at the government she was part of whenever given an audience. She then really stepped up in the lead up to the 2022 national elections aiming for no less than the presidency and making an even stronger claim to being the “leader” of all of the Opposition.
So people ask me why I continue to write about her despite last year’s election supposedly now behind us. Really? After all of the above they now expect us to simply move on from who and what Robredo was and represented?
For one thing, the 2022 elections evidently aren’t over yet as far as many members of the Opposition are concerned. According to a “report” authored by Dwight de Leon for Rappler, “some concerned groups still refuse to accept the results of the vote, raising numerous theories alleging fraud.” This means Robredo remains as relevant as she has been over the last several years. She is still seen to be the “hero” who will “rescue” Filipinos from the “evil” regime of the second Marcos presidency.
No less than the top Opposition “news” networks regard her as extremely newsworthy. Presumably, for happening to be a woman given that March was deemed “Women’s Month”, Robredo was put up as the quintessential Filipino woman by various news outlets such as CNN Philippines where she was interviewed by senior anchor Rico Hizon. In another interview video published by ABS-CBN News, she is cited as one of the country’s “remarkable women”.
All this, of course, just might work. Being buried by “the son of the dictator” in that all-important national election of yore is the real big news here — Robredo’s crowning failure. It seems, however, that she is off to great things — helping “the poor” and all that. She’s a politician, of course. All politicians help the poor, see. Robredo, however, is special. Humble bloggers like moi are not allowed to write about people crowned no less than The Messiah by thought leaders of the Philippines’ “civil society”.",Politics
Why is Leni Robredo still in the news? Because the Philippine Opposition can’t attract REAL political talent.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/why-is-leni-robredo-still-in-the-news-because-the-philippine-opposition-cant-attract-real-political-talent/,"Opposition “thought leaders” decry what they perceive to be a continued haranguing of “former vice president” Leni Robredo. Robredo, we recall “led” the Philippine Opposition to a crushing defeat in the 2022 presidential elections — an election that the Opposition deemed too important to lose. In actual practice, they did not seem to have considered it important enough to unite under a single banner to go up against what was clearly a formidable opponent. Worse, they chose Leni Robredo to be their “leader” — effectively creating a clique of wokes, associating themselves with a social elite, and effectively alienating the rest of the electorate. That is, quite simply, Losing Elections 101.
Yet here remains Leni Robredo, still the darling of Mainstream Philippine Media…

Granted, Big Corporate Philippine Media is under pressure from their shareholders to bring in the clicks, eyeballs, and engagement (to further attract those clicks and eyeballs). Lowest-common-denominator wisdom dictates that a character that was buried in a national election that catapulted now-president Bongbong Marcos to power by the first ever majority vote since that 1986 “revolution” shouldn’t be the subject of content required to fulfill that business imperative. To be fair, however, we can’t really dismiss the chops of ABS-CBN’s big corporate data analytics team. Data analytics, after all, often reveals counterintuitive truths; for example, proving to people afraid of flying that crossing a street is far more dangerous than getting on a 22-hour trans-Pacific flight full of non-mask-wearing passengers.
The fact is, Robredo does attract the clicks and eyeballs but not because she is well-liked. Robredo is, to put it simply, a nice social media pastime. This is why having Leni as the subject of a social media post or piece of media content gets those thousands of “retweets”, “likes”, and reshares. This is also why, a cohort like the Yellowtards (who “led” the Opposition to oblivion over three consecutive national elections) who measure messaging success based on numbers of likes, retweets, and shares had misled themselves catastrophically so many times (and continue to do so today). Social media stats don’t necessarily spell success. They only provide insight on what keeps people entertained.
More importantly, this highlights the profound dishonesty of mainstream media “journalism”. Corporate media is, at its most fundamental, in the business of entertaining people. What was once a “public service” — news reporting — was once regarded as mere overhead. Good business strategy involves either managing overhead or finding ways to harvest economic value off costly activities that can’t be gotten rid of. Television “news reporting” evolved (or, rather, devolved) very likely as a result of that management imperative — transformed from a sober public service to a bells-and-whistles entertainment product that delivers nagbabagang balita! (emphasis on the exclamation mark).
Coming close to a year after the Marcos-Duterte tandem utterly buried the Opposition, it seems kinda sad that Robredo — loser embodied — continues to be seen as the face of the Opposition. That a country of more than 110 million cannot produce even one Opposition leader to replace this loser says a lot about the pool of talent in its society. If not to win the next national election, the Opposition should at least prove that the Philippines’ got talent. If Filipinos can’t create global P- or F-pop phenomena, can’t replace decrepit jeepneys with modern public transport, or even invent longer-lasting light bulbs (despite the legend that a Filipino “invented” fluorescent lighting), at least show that somebody with potential to be a better opposition leader than Leni Robredo is slogging through her math textbooks at the Ateneo — or scrounging around for pagpag somewhere within those steaming squatter colonies while dreaming of becoming the next President of the Philippines.",Politics
The Philippines’ return to the embrace of its former colonial master firmly secures the Second Marcos administration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/the-philippines-return-to-the-embrace-of-its-former-colonial-master-firmly-secures-the-second-marcos-administration/,"Now they don’t want EDCA? Former Reuters correspondent Manny Mogato writes about the “genuine concerns from some sectors about a looming conflict in the region” in the context of the ramping up of the United States’ military presence in the Philippines within the frame of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Mogato expresses his skepticism over Philippine foreign secretary Enrique Manalo’s “assurances” that the Philippine government “would still discuss what activities would be allowed in the four new military bases where American troops were allowed access.”
…the Philippines has no capability to detect if munitions and other materiel stored in the EDCA sites are nuclear-capable.
The US has a policy of neither confirming nor denying if its ships and planes are carrying nuclear weapons. However, any nuclear-powered attack submarine that lurks somewhere in the Indo-Pacific area has strategic nuclear missiles.
Are we to believe the Americans that they will remove these strategic weapons every time an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine visits the country?
The opposition can’t make up its mind. At this point, no critical thinking Pinoy is naive enough to think that the Americans won’t test the limits of EDCA. They’ve had plenty of experience when they still had their bases in the country. Anyone think that Philippine President Bongbong Marcos is naive as well? Of course not. When your family is forcibly deported from your own country by a foreign power which also engineered the ouster of your father, being naive is being stupid and Marcos is not stupid. Marcos is going on an official visit to the US. He’s going to see Biden in the White House. This has been his goal. Western validation. The removal of the family stigma of being pariahs since 1986.
Meanwhile, the new Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang is on an official visit to the country. How Marcos and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) will balance out the diplomatic relationship between the two powers remains to be seen. But it’s clear the Philippines is the odd man out in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) again with our categorical support for the US and the EDCA bases they have in the country now. China has been making their displeasure known in the disputed waters with the increased number of vessels on patrol. China hasn’t deployed gray ships yet but they have done so in the Taiwan strait.
Interestingly, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its economic forecast for the Philippines. We’re the niño bonito again. Perhaps Marcos believes that the US continues to hold that kind of power in the same manner the IMF torpedoed the Philippine economy from 1983-1986, setting off the political crisis to justify the economic contraction. Most Filipinos are pro-US so Marcos feels safe with his pivot. It also neutralizes the opposition because the Americans won’t tolerate any destabilization attempt, not that the opposition is capable of anything serious at this point. When you have jokes for leaders then there are no available options.
On the local front, it’s open season for those who are part of the inner circle. The Philippine National Police (PNP) is playing with drugs again. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is happily back in the arms of their American counterparts. Again, this ensures that Marcos’ tenure is secure. The infrastructure deficit continues to rear its ugly head as it affects anything and everything. Just look at how expressways became parking lots during the holy week break. Supply can’t keep up with demand but that’s virtually impossible. This is why there’s a need for better transport options such as rail.
No need to elaborate about what’s wrong with our country. It’s also getting to be tiring barking up at the tree as it’s beginning to look like genuine reform is hopeless. The best we can do is just enjoy the optics of the Marcos Presidency. At this point, it’s the best show that’s on.",Politics
"Red tagging is not a crime. Communist genocide, on the other hand, is.",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/red-tagging-is-not-a-crime-communist-genocide-on-the-other-hand-is/,"It’s just a tag just as “reactionary” is a term used by communists to label their enemies. Imagine for a minute a future where the communists had successfully mounted their violent “people’s revolution” and installed their “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Why, the first thing these crooks would do is hunt down these “reactionaries”, drag them from the nice houses they built with their hard-earned money and put them in front of firing squads.
This is exactly what the commies did in Cambodia. The communist party of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge, went on a massive killing spree that resulted in the deaths of millions of “reactionaries”. So bad was this massacre that Cambodian journalist Dith Pran coined the term “killing fields” to describe the thousands of mass grave sites that were used to bury the victims of this “revolution”.
Mr. Dith saw his country descend into a living hell as he scraped and scrambled to survive the barbarous revolutionary regime of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, when as many as two million Cambodians — a third of the population — were killed, experts estimate. Mr. Dith survived through nimbleness, guile and sheer desperation. His credo: Make no move unless there was a 50-50 chance of not being killed.
Back then, and in many other parts of the world that they infested, communists engaged in the very same activity they claim to be victims of today. Their rabid supporters merely pointed a finger at a person they summarily deemed a “reactionary” and their respective Gestapos took it from there. The very same “revolution” is being mounted by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) through its terrorist group, the New People’s Army (NPA). In an interview published in Esquire magazine in 2017, the late founder of the CPP-NPA, Jose Maria “Joma” Sison, articulated his vision of the armed revolution his people are waging…
The people’s war answers the central question of revolution, which is to seize power. Even before nationwide seizure of power, local organs of the people’s democratic government are already being established to displace the reactionary government. Socio-economic revolution is going on through genuine land reform, promoting cooperative production and favoring Filipino-owned industries. The cultural revolution is going on. It is advancing the cause of a national, scientific and people-serving cultural and educational system. Revolutionary educators, writers and artists, scientists, and technologists and other cultural workers and the great mass of activists of the national democratic movement are waging a cultural revolution.
As recently as 2020, the then soon-to-croak founder of the Party described the nefarious objectives of the NPA…
Combatants are rotated so that everyone has combat experience and contribue to the drive for increasing the arms of the NPA by launching tactical offensives to wipe out enemy units. The long-running plan of the CPP is to raise the armed strength of the NPA from 10,000 high-powered rifles to 25,000 in order to reach the strategic stalemate and launch tactical offensives with companies and battalions.
The key difference is that, today, the Philippines is a democracy with a functioning criminal justice system and a civilian police force. Any political camp is free to label the other something — “Yellowtard”, “Dutertard”, “DDS”, “Lenitard”, “fascist”, bayaran, “troll”, and, yes, “communist”. It’s no different to how other woke communities like feminists and “gay rights” activists come up with all sorts of terms to categorise people based on their sexual orientation and reproductive equipment (whether natural or artificial). It’s just part of the human condition, the human mind being a wondrously complex classification engine and our species being one that is tribal at its cultural core.
Communist “activists” make it sound as if they are a special class of people — one that is exempt from being labelled and tagged. Thus, they now come up with the idiotic notion that being “red tagged” is a crime. Well, all we can really say to these “special” people is this: Welcome to the club. There is nothing special about being a communist.",Politics
Happy Leni Robredo Day!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/happy-leni-robredo-day/,"The sun has set in the West and another Leni Robredo Day has past. Seems like a sudden surge in media coverage of last year’s failed presidential candidate was ill-timed as it created an unintended association with yesterday’s date. By the way, this isn’t an April Fools article. This is 100 percent as real as any other article published on a Get Real Philippines site.
Why does Leni Robredo come to mind whenever the idea of a fool comes up in a conversation? The answer to this question is, of course, a no-brainer. Thing is, most things need to be spelt out to Filipinos explicitly. This is why satire and dry humour don’t work in Philippine showbiz.
Leni Robredo is a fool because she put her hand up to “lead” what was the most important battle the Yellowtard-Communist Axis would ever fight. It was a battle they thought — no, believed — they would never need to fight. It was the fight to stop a second Marcos ascent to power. Worse, when it did come to the point where it needed to be fought (a point which neither came suddenly nor was all that surprising) they chose Leni Robredo to lead them into battle. They chose her and were confident they’d win.
The way the Yellowtards and commies are behaving today, one would think that they had lost no more than a school soccer match and just gone home to take a shower and watch TV. They’re content having mom pat them on the head assuring them they played well and that next weekend would be another match and that all they needed to do next time was “try their best”.
Their best.
We recall the wise words of John Mason played by Sean Connery in the 1996 film The Rock. It goes something like this:
Losers whine about doing their best. Winners go home and f*ck the Prom Queen.
What seems to ail the Opposition is that their aspiration is not to win. Their aspiration is to be seen to be the “good” forces in any “fight” and that those meant to lose are the “evil” ones. Such thinking adds two layers of cognitive blocks to clear thinking: (1) a feeling of entitlement to victory and (2) an unwillingness to reflect and take lessons from failure.
We see that pattern today in how even the foremost “thought leaders” of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis strut around exchanging mutual high fives for an achievement the rest of us may not be privy to — some sort of victory that only insiders are in on. Perhaps they are right. Maybe the Yellowtards (and their Red comrades) remain blessed by a superior authority the graces of whom our damned lot — the non-chosen and unsaved people — remain outside of. What are the origins of such style of thinking? The answer to that question is so obvious that I think I’ll stop right here.",Politics
Disunity cracking the UniTeam: Knives out as players jostle for position,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/disunity-cracking-the-uniteam-knives-out-as-players-jostle-for-position/,"Is there a break in the UniTeam this early in the game? Most likely yes. Back in the campaign leadup to the 2022 national elections, then President Rodrigo Duterte read the political tea leaves right and knew that then candidate Bongbong Marcos couldn’t win the presidency without his daughter Inday Sara Duterte in tow. His biggest political miscalculation was believing his favorite child would obey his mandate that she run for the presidency with Bong Go as her runningmate or worst, with her as the running mate. Inday wouldn’t have any of this not after she demonstrated her power by ousting the long-time political and personal ally of her father Bebot Alvarez. This is the reason why there is this much political noise early in the game.
It will be the first year of Marcos in office yet if you’re a politics junkie, you get the feeling that the crown isn’t firmly in place on his head. This doesn’t mean that there will be a coup against Marcos. It’s just that he’s not able to control the competing factions in his coalition so he can properly govern, by Philippine standards. Marcos remains popular because of the Duterte alliance. This is the confirmation that Filipinos are done and over with the Yellowidiots and have cast their lot with the Marcos-Arroyo-Duterte combine. Inday doesn’t take to umbrage kindly which is why she quit Lakas as soon as it demoted former Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) in the House of Representatives. As columnist Lito Banayo points out in his Manila Standard piece “Deconstructing the ‘disunity’”, Inday’s statement is like a coded message to BBM.
On the matter of timing, it comes at about the same time the president appointed Gilbert Teodoro as defense secretary, a position that supposedly Sara wanted, as stated by then presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos?
And Senadora Imee, the president’s elder sister, take note once again, has not been totally supportive of her brother’s presidential initiatives, whether on his pro-US of A expansion of foreign military presence or the Maharlika fund.
Neither the senator nor the vice-president have been endorsing persons for appointive positions in an administration that till now has many vacancies yet to fill.
The vice-president finds the antics of the congressmen she labeled “sycophants” as “quite amusing.”
Make no mistake, however, for when her time comes, she will not forget, and she will not be amused.
But the latter part of her statement is gist for intrigue, where she reiterates that the administration of the president is “strong and stable.”
This is why when asked for a reaction to Duterte’s resignation from Lakas, the President could only say, she is what she is. Marcos’s problem is his political party going into the 2025 midterm election doesn’t exist. For the first time there was no mass exodus into the president’s party. The Partido Federal’s membership hasn’t increased even if its candidate won the presidency. Simply put, most everyone stayed in their respective political flags of convenience. There hasn’t even been a mass defection to Lakas even if Sara was a member. The coalition is holding because the powers that be declare that it should be the case; for the time being. But in a banana republic where money and politics or politics and money are interchangeable, the opportunity to grab the top spot isn’t one to be passed on. This is why there is that commissioned survey.
Marcos has made all the right moves to cement his hold on power. The oligarchs are happy. He has pivoted to the US and has been rewarded with a White House audience. Gibo Teodoro is his defense secretary which means he’s the one in charge of selling the new pension fund and making sure to squeeze the most out of Uncle Sam for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization. The Duterte-Romualdez falling out is not irreparable but it does present a risk going into 2028. This is why Imee isn’t completely in her brother’s inner circle. She is the bridge to Inday and GMA. Sara’s political evolution isn’t complete yet. She needs to hone her skillset further but that won’t happen until she ends her estrangement from her father. She isn’t like her father who wields intellectual depth and can stand alone and by any comment he makes about any issue put before him. Her team isn’t the best of the best either as proven by its composition at DepEd. The education portfolio is a ticking time bomb. Defense wasn’t given to her not because she would launch a coup against Marcos but because she wouldn’t be palatable to Uncle Sam.
To my mind the disunity in the UniTeam has been brought about also by Marcos’ inner circle. There is no bastonero like Bong Go and Bingbong Medialdea who kept order and prevented the projection of the President as weak. Credit also goes to Duterte who didn’t need a spokesperson to communicate with the public. On the outside, everyone is still being civil but there’s no doubt that the knives are out and moves are being made. This is why we don’t have much of a future because so much time is wasted on the pursuit of money and power through politics that there is no focus on proper governance, reforms and long-term planning. At my age, I’ve seen everything and change isn’t in the horizon. Not any time soon.",Politics
Militant STAND UP “activist” and former USC Councilor Carl Ieuan Uba in hot water over allegations of sexual misconduct!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/militant-stand-up-activist-and-former-usc-councilor-carl-ieuan-uba-in-hot-water-over-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct/,"Social media is a a abuzz over a certain Carl Ieuan Uba who was councilor in the University of the Philippines (UP) Student Council (USC) over the school year 2021 to 2022.
It seems Uba was a respected member of the cadre of communist “activists” that infest UP campuses as evident in this tweet from the organisation League of Filipino Students which is closely associated with the Communist Party of the Philippines.
Allegations of sexual harassment directed against Uba had recently been emerging on social media, many of them authored by former students or group members attesting to having filed criminal complaints against Uba who served in USC under the UP Diliman campus organisation Student Alliance for the Advancement of Democratic Rights in UP (STAND UP). One noted activist, Kelsey Hadjirul who had filed a case tweeted that Uba “was a known sexual predator, facing several cases from different sectors”.
STAND UP, under the banner of which Uba served in the USC “is the premier student leadership formation and the broadest party-alliance of militant organizations in UP Diliman,” according to the Twitter profile of the organisation. As of this writing, no statement on the matter can be seen issued over its social media accounts (including that of its Facebook page).",Politics
The Senate: a political institution that lost its luster,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/the-senate-a-political-institution-that-lost-its-luster/,"The Philippine Senate is a political institution that was created during the American occupation years. Also called “the upper house”, the Senate is a legislative body that can be traced back to the Philippine Commission, which was created to assist the Americans in administering government powers in the Philippines. According to the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Senate is composed of 24 senators, where 12 seats will be up for grabs every three years. A senator can only serve two consecutive six-year terms, for a total of 12 years. As senators are elected by the whole country, it requires candidates to be immensely popular as the electorate votes for 12 senators every three years.
Aside from its legislative responsibilities, the current constitution grants additional powers to the members of the Senate. Senators are needed to complete the Commission on Appointments, where approval is required from the aforementioned commission before department secretaries and ambassadors officially assume their duties in their respective departments or foreign posts. The Senate also has the ability to impeach the president and the chief justice, albeit requiring the House of Representatives’ (lower house’s) consent. In addition, the Senate ratifies treaties signed with other countries, whether bilateral or multilateral in nature. These strong powers granted by the constitution to the Senate provide an impression that, ideally, the upper chamber must be filled with respectable, competent, and dignified individuals who are committed to defend the interests of the Philippine archipelago and of the Filipino people. However, reality seems distant to what is ideal.
The current political reality is that, the Senate is no longer the political institution that it should be. This can be seen when one keenly observes and contextualizes the general and midterm elections held from 1992 until 2022. Three decades’ history of electing senators reveal patterns that put a spotlight light on how feeble and fragile political institutions are in the Philippines. With such, there are two election observations that must be noted vis-à-vis the Philippine Senate.
The first observation is that, the winning candidates who garner the most number of votes are usually showbiz or media personalities, or candidates who are directly related to these individuals The exemptions would be the 1995 elections with current Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 2016 elections with then-Senator Franklin Drilon, and the 2019 elections with current Senator Cynthia Villar. However, in the 2016 senatorial elections, Senator Tito Sotto ranked third, while current Senator Grace Poe held to the second position in the 2019 elections. This leaves the 1995 senatorial elections as the only genuine exemption to such generalization.
The second observation is that, the Senate is becoming a mere launching pad for politicians who eye higher positions in the next general elections, which are the Offices of the President and the Vice President. In the 1992 elections, then-Senator Joseph Estrada became Vice President and in the next general elections, he won the presidency with then-Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo occupying his previous position. In the 2004 elections, the ticket of Arroyo-de Castro emerged victorious, who both had legislative experience as senators. In 2010, then-Senator Benigno Aquino III won Malacanang and, last year, Ferdinand Marcos Jr cruised his way to a landslide victory for the country’s top position after also serving as a one-term senator. Only the 2016 general elections would serve as an exemption, as both then-Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and then-Camarines Sur Representative Ma. Leonor Robredo held no position in the Senate. Aside from the eventual winning candidates and then-Vice President Jejomar Binay, the 2016 elections were crowded with senators who ran for higher office.
Connecting these two observations regarding Philippine electoral results together, it becomes evident that the Senate is no longer the illustrious political institution that it was initially meant to be. Gone are the days when Filipino luminaries like Miriam Defensor Santiago, Juan Flavier, Blas Ople, and Joker Arroyo, who exemplified competence, genuine public service, and a solid understanding of Philippine realpolitik graces the Senate halls. Unfortunately, the senate has degraded and become a stark reflection of a deeply-embedded oligarchy and oligopoly that stubbornly resists political reform. However, these politicians cannot be blamed completely because the current political system of the Philippines incentivizes them to lean more towards popularity instead of competence. Luckily, the Philippines can learn from world history through the successes of the Roman Senate and the United States Senate, which are political institutions that played significant roles in nation-building.
Albeit different from its legislative powers that are associated with modern upper chambers, the Roman Senate served as a governing body from the formation of the humble Etruscan city-state of Rome until the eventual disintegration of the Roman Empire. The changing powers of the Roman Senate reflected the economic, political, and social realities that Rome has faced, where the aforementioned political institution served as the basis for the Romans in creating a strong state. Despite its shortcomings, the Roman Senate allowed itself to undergo structural reform and surrender some of its powers due to external pressures. This allowed the Roman state to effectively and efficiently respond to national exigencies which allowed the Roman civilization to last for more than a millennium.
On the other hand, the American Senate, which serves as the other half of the bicameral legislature of the United States, roughly plays the same roles and is afforded similar powers to that of the Philippine Senate. However, what sets the United States Senate apart from its Philippine counterpart is its structure. The current American Senate is composed of 100 senators, where each state is represented by two senators, who in turn are elected by their state electorate. Despite qualms over proposals to adjust the numbers of senatorial representation that would reflect their respective demographics, the two senators per state structure was designed to avoid tyranny of the majority. If it wasn’t the case, the sheer numerical superiority of the states of California, Texas, Florida, and New York can easily silence the interests of Vermont, Alaska, Delaware, and Wyoming.
Looking at the cases of the senates of Rome and the United States, the Philippines’ upper house must definitely undergo political restructuring. Ideally, the Senate must be an institution that acknowledges and works toward the protection and promotion of Philippine national interests, but the reality seems to be far from it as it has merely become a bastion of political ambition. How can representative democracy work in the Philippines when the upper chamber is predominantly represented by individuals hailing from Luzon and Metro Manila? Will these senators understand the hardships of the heavily-marginalized regions and provinces of the Philippines? If Filipinos desire political reform, most specially in the senate, it begins and ends with charter change.",Politics

That leadership conundrum at the time will go down in history as the most baffling aspect of the 2022 national elections because, even before the campaign started, it was well-recognised that the then emerging Marcos-Duterte “administration” ticket was on its way to a landslide victory that only a unified opposition can stop.
All that is, of course, history and enough analysis of that story had been done. Well, for that matter, there really was no need to apply any rocket science to analyse what is, really, a massive Opposition failure. The Opposition should have ideally been unified in late 2020, locked and loaded with a leader by early 2021, and equipped with an intelligent pitch to Filipinos (as opposed to the limpdicked pink one they came up with) at about that same time. In short, the Opposition was already a failure early in 2021.
The debate on the Philippines’ strategic direction is now one being had between camps largely within the original “Unity” camp with the most intense exchanges happening between camps loyal to the Dutertes and those loyal to Marcos. To be fair, it is still an adolescent war-of-words between two cults of personalities. The point, however, is that the presumed “opposition” — what remains of Robredo’s discredited “KakamPink” force — is no longer even a footnote in the national debate. This is largely due to their persistent belief that they were “cheated” out of a win they were entitled to by sinister forces of “disinformation” and “historical revisionism” and continue to prop their waning relevance up with their old Martial Law Crybaby narrative.
Again, we only need to face simple facts about why the old “Opposition” find themselves in the dumpster today. They failed to unify, failed to put up a competent leader, failed to come up with a campaign pitch based on an accurate reading of public sentiment, and refused, as the campaign progressed, to learn from insights described by data published by reputable polling firms. They were utterly buried in May 2022 because of their arrogance, lack of capacity for inward reflection, and tone deafness to the national pulse.
Today, the Opposition stew in their own juices of failure while the “victors” gloat Talo si Leni (Leni lost!). That’s because that is what really happened. Leni Robredo is not a victim of “sinister forces”. She lost because she did not play well. Rather than stew, the Opposition need to focus on levelling up. Play a better game. Anticipate the feints, the bluffs, and learn to think three steps ahead. It’s simple, really. Whether one likes it or not, democracy is a game all Filipinos signed up to. You can’t dismiss a game you chose to play just because you lost.",Politics
Did Babe Romualdez forget that the US Killed Millions of Filipinos?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/did-babe-romualdez-forget-that-the-us-killed-millions-of-filipinos/,"In less than a year, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez has achieved most of what was on Uncle Sam’s laundry list of to-do’s for US Interests to be pursued in the Philippines. These pursuits had been in the dumps since former President Rodrigo Duterte won the Presidency in 2016 and promptly declared that the Philippines will not side with any major foreign power, an indirect reference to the Americans as the former colonial masters.
Romualdez didn’t achieve much during the Duterte administration in his role as the Philippine representative to the US. He didn’t even bother to issue a strongly-worded statement when Filipinos became the top victims of vicious hate crimes there or when Filipino deportees were handcuffed during the plane ride home,
He failed to fight for the Philippines when the US blocked the weapons delivery for our soldiers at the height of Marawi crisis or vaccines for our medical frontliners during the height of the pandemic.
The same is true when it came to working for Filipino nurses’ rights to additional compensation at the height of the of the Covid lockdown when American hospitals were teeming with patients and nurses risked their lives by working way more hours than required.
He also failed to demand a commitment from the US on their support for our ownership claim of Sabah,
Romualdez has been busier shuttling back and forth between Washington and Manila, mostly lobbying for American interests in the Philippines, instead of the other way around as his job requires.
He did admit to directly lobbying with Duterte for the restoration of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which was an American condition to allowing the sale of Western-brand mRNA vaccines to the Philippines. At the height of great need for the Philippines, the Americans, who claim to be our allies, were nowhere to be found, and so was Ambassador Romualdez.
In an Asia Times interview with Richard Heydarian, Romualdez also elaborated on the question of an expanded alliance, not only with the US, but with other QUAD partners such as Japan and Australia. Romualdez said that the Philippines is open to such agreements with “like-minded” allies in the region. Interestingly, he didn’t even mention that Japan and the US bombed each other in Manila in World War II resulting in the deaths of over a million Filipinos.
Since the renewal of “closer ties” between the Philippines and the US, the latter has been more vocal in its expressions of support against Chinese “incursions” in the disputed waters off the South China Sea.
Philippine Coast Guard echoes US Interests
The Philippine Coast Guard has also been more aggressive in issuing challenges to Chinese fishing vessels during its patrols, in recent encounters asking the captains of vessels thru approach to provide information about their intentions. There are no reports of these Chinese fishing vessels bothering to respond to these challenges at all.
One can’t help but think that the US is being deliberate with these moves as part of an effort to provoke China into acting against the Philippines and Taiwan. There have been statements from both Romualdez and Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo of additional Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the country, aside from the additional four which were recently announced.
All of these concessions favor the US but not much has been given to the Philippines in exchange for the same. The US Trade Representative, Katherine Tai, even went to the Philippines to slap the rejection in our face, categorically stated that the Philippines is still not part of the Trans-Pacific trade agreement and the renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is up to the decision of the US Congress.
America’s Betrayals of the Philippines
Critical-thinking Filipinos question what exactly the Philippines stands to gain in return for these military concessions which put Filipinos at great risk.
The Americans gave the Japanese a pass when it came to the amount of war reparations to be paid to the Philippines. The Americans never rebuilt the infrastructure damaged during the war nor did they come up with a corresponding aid package to finance the reconstruction for the Philippines. The Americans handed Sabah to the British on a silver platter after it took possession of the Philippines under the Treaty of Paris. The Americans took advantage of the country’s natural resources from 1898 up to 1974, when the Philippines was still a colony and after “independence” in 1946, when the Americans continued to enjoy parity rights with Filipinos up to 1974.
It appears that Romualdez is primus inter pares with President Bongbong Marcos when it comes to the conduct of foreign policy, particularly to the diplomatic relationship with the US. It can’t be said that Marcos doesn’t know what’s going on but the elephant in the room is this: What concessions did Romualdez get for Marcos which became the basis for the turnaround in the country’s “independent” foreign policy?
There will be ramifications for these actions with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China. So far, China has continued playing a game of chicken with Marcos and the Americans. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang paid a visit to the Philippines recently. The reception and talks were cordial but the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs and Coast Guard continue to publish messages critical of China in the media.
Marcos loyalist social media operators surfaced a photo of Marcos having dinner with Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian but it seemed convenient that no other details were provided. This was supposed to be proof that Marcos is a “friend to all.”
Despite the continued claims of Marcos that his foreign policy continues to be “independent,” not too many Filipinos believe it to be. Most Filipinos are pro-American than Chinese but they must not forget that the Americans have a poor track record of delivering on their puny “commitments” to the Philippines.
There is the Scarborough Shoal standoff of 2012 which serves as a constant reminder of how easily the Americans can sell out the Filipinos if it is in their best interest. This is what the “rules-based international order” that the Americans have been pushing, stands for.
Conservative estimates cite a total of one million Filipinos perishing in World War II. Manila was the second most devastated city after Warsaw. It ceased to be the Pearl of the Orient. During the Philippine – American War from 1899 – 1902, an estimated 200,000- 600,000 Filipinos died, with only 20,000 as combatants. The greater majority consisted of civilians who perished in massacres perpetrated by American soldiers.
Who is the man called Babe?
Jose Manuel Del Gallego “Babe” Romualdez is a second cousin to the Marcos’ through the former First Lady Imelda, who is the first cousin of his father, Alberto Sr. His brother, Alberto Jr., was the Secretary of Health during the Estrada administration. He is the third Romualdez to become the Philippine Ambassador to the United States. Eduardo, an uncle and Kokoy, his cousin, preceded him.
Romualdez is one of two rabid Amboys in the Philippine diplomatic and press scene. The other is former Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin, who is now the Philippine Ambassador to the Court of St. James.
Interestingly enough, both Romualdez and Locsin enjoy their career renaissance because of their appointment to their previous posts by the erstwhile quintessential anti-American, former President Rodrigo Duterte.
Locsin was initially appointed the Philippine Ambassador to the United Nations while Romualdez as Special Envoy to the United States while the post of Ambassador was unfilled. Duterte later made Romualdez’s appointment permanent, while Locsin replaced Alan Peter Cayetano, as the country’s top diplomat.
Some pundits labeled Duterte’s appointment of Romualdez and Locsin as master strokes because it left him free and clear to make it appear he effected a paradigm shift in Philippine foreign policy by being more pro-China and anti-US, while retaining the services of two the country’s top pro-American journalist-diplomats.
Romualdez has been working to restore American preeminence in the Philippines since Marcos’s victory last May 9. It was Romualdez who organized the working visit to the US, which was basically Marcos attending the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York and meeting with different US companies looking at potential investments in the country. The bonus was the meet-and-greet with US President Joe Biden on the sidelines.
Marcos just completed his official visit to the US. The media reported on the many promises and pledges but not one questioned how much of the past pledges were actually delivered and actually benefited the Philippines. His audience with Biden, who enjoys less than 35% approval rating, is the crowning achievement of Romualdez, who had been pushing for it with the State Department and the West Wing officials of the White House.
This is after the US rejected the Philippines request for better trade arrangements, but comes after the Balikatan exercises between the Philippines and US military, where 12,000 American soldiers were said to have trained shoulder to shoulder with 5,000 Filipino soldiers.",Politics
Leila De Lima’s acquittal ultimately counts for nothing for the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/leila-de-limas-acquittal-ultimately-counts-for-nothing-for-the-philippine-opposition/,"“Thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition are once again doing the Dance of Joy over what they see as their latest “win” against the “Forces of Darkness”. That, of course, is on the assumption that the Opposition led by the Yellowtard-Communist Axis are the “good” in a “fight” versus “evil”.
After spending more than half a decade in jail on charges of drug trafficking, this recent acquittal of a charge that she received money from drug traffickers is just the second of three cases filed against former Senator Leila De Lima. This means De Lima will continue to remain imprisoned pending the outcome of the third. The Opposition, as expected, are making this all about “long overdue justice” finally being served. They put this within the context of their insistence that De Lima was a “victim” of persecution perpetrated by the government of former President Rodrigo Duterte who, they say, was behind what they describe as “trumped up charges” levied against De Lima for being critical of his government.
In doing so, the Opposition are of the belief that “bad” things happen to “good” people like De Lima because of “bad” presidents. One wonders then whether if they now believe that a “good” president is behind this “good outcome” for said “good” person — which brings us to an important point. The bottom-line question here is whether or not a good outcome for De Lima will score political points for the Opposition. After all, a camp that went to lengths to politicise the “plight” of a person they painted as a “victim” would expect a return on that investment, right?
Unfortunately, De Lima — an Opposition “asset” that had seen better days — will likely not contribute much to the already scant political capital that the Opposition hope to apply to their goal of winning an election any time soon. The problems of the Opposition lie far deeper than the scarcity of able leaders they had long suffered. While confronting evidence that their efforts to win the 2022 elections failed because of the profound incompetence of their campaign stares them in the face, the Opposition has so far exhibited an inability to learn important lessons from that experience. De Lima herself whose “victimhood” was fodder for this dysfunctional campaign was part of the very collateral that failed to deliver results to the Yellowtard-Communist Axis in that last “important” election.
What new fodder for the ongoing power grab the Opposition continues to mount against the government could be squeezed out of the De Lima circus is anyone’s guess. The “Human Rights” Card has already been overplayed for decades and the dismal showing of the Opposition in the last election should have been a wake up call to them to apply a bit more creativity, original thinking, and listening skills to their messaging. Sadly for the Philippine Opposition and the Yellowtard-Communist Axis that presumes to lead it, it seems their severe learning disability will persist over the foreseeable future.",Politics
Getting the Philippines to Denmark (Part I),https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/getting-the-philippines-to-denmark-part-i/,"The Philippines had recently celebrated its 125th Independence Day. It is a celebration that symbolizes how Filipino forefathers have broken the shackles of centuries-long Spanish imperialism and colonialism. It also serves as a reminder to reflect on the sacrifices of Filipinos in pursuing the path towards self-determination. As June 12, 1898 became a date when the Filipino people attempted to liberate itself from its powerful Western colonizers, two questions continue to persist even after 125 years, and seem to attract no conclusive answers. Is the Philippines a free country, and do Filipinos live lives with freedom? The first question pertains to the Philippine state, while the second question is about the Philippine society. These types of multi-dimensional questions require multiple points of view and perspectives to answer.
Technically speaking, the Philippines did not enjoy its freedom after General Emilio Aguinaldo declared the country’s independence from Spain. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Madrid sold and transferred the ownership of its colonial possessions to the United States, then a rising global hegemon. Aside from the Philippine Islands, Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico were also included in the aforementioned treaty. With these territories, the United States began acquiring new territories beyond its home continent, which is eerily similar with how their European counterparts in the United Kingdom and France expanded their respective empires.
Washington’s geopolitical ambitions began to take shape during the McKinley administration as the United States became politically powerful and economically wealthy. With the United States becoming more involved in protecting its own economic interests, the Philippines became its newest gateway to Asia. With Paris holding French Indochina, and London occupying British India and the Malay States, France and the United Kingdom had an advantageous geographical proximity to the biggest treasure chest in Asia: China. Having the Philippine Islands under American leadership afforded Washington an ability to extend its influence and engage in economic activities in the Pacific. American occupation of the Philippines was veiled with the sugar-coated words benevolent assimilation, where Americans bear the responsibility to civilize the savages, thus the concept of the White Man’s burden that even prominent writer Mark Twain openly criticised. Eventually, American exceptionalism and Japanese militarism came into a collision course.
Tokyo’s geopolitical ambitions on the other hand were based on the failures of Qing China in the Opium Wars. In the eyes of the Japanese, modernization, westernization, and reformation were the keys to a strong country which they pursued relentlessly after the Tokugawa Shogunate came to an end. With a burgeoning economy and a population with a rapidly-growing appetite for natural resources, Imperial Japan annexed territories from its immediate neighbors in Qing China, Korea, and Imperial Russia. Deteriorating relations with other major powers didn’t help as Tokyo eyed more territories to carve up for itself, most specially the lush rubber plantations and hydrocarbon fields in modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia through its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What had barred the Japanese military juggernaut in exploiting those resources is the Philippines which housed a significant number of American armed personnel making Manila a necessary capital city to take over.
Foreign powers portrayed their global ambitions on the Philippines, where Manila became the Warsaw of the Orient with the conclusion of the Pacific War. As a way to lessen its load as it became a significant player in global politics, the United States granted official independence to the Philippine Islands, albeit with various economic restrictions that favored American investors and companies. Nevertheless, the Philippines made its official entry in the international theater as a founding member of the League of Nations’ successor, the United Nations. A few decades after 1898, the Philippines became its own nation, its own state.
How did the Philippine Islands become a state? It is because that the Philippines has achieved four requirements that makes a state a state — a permanent population, a defined territory, government, and recognition by other countries. Nevertheless, the Philippines continues to be seen to be a weak, fragile state. Weak states are characterized by dismal government services, inefficient judiciary systems, graft and corruption, internal security issues, massive wealth inequality, and fractionalization. Is this the kind of freedom that is present and enjoyed in the Philippines?
Prominent economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have thoroughly discussed in their book The Narrow Corridor the subject of what genuine freedom is all about. Imagine the slavery institutions of the past. Slave labor has seen a long history in human civilizations, from Ancient Egypt to the Belgian Congo, even in pre-colonial Philippines’ with the aliping saguiguilid and aliping namamahay. What made slavery institutions last was the existential risk of being free. Tracing English philosopher Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan, where man, by nature, is selfish and focused on self-preservation as vital for survival. Despite being at the bottom of the social strata, slaves existed and persisted because a social contract exists that guarantees their survival. Running out free in the wild, away from institutional slavery is a more dangerous option than being tied to owners as slaves, or being tied to land as serfs. That is why despite the victory of the Union against the Confederacy during the American Civil War, black slaves weren’t fully accorded the economic and political opportunities that white Americans enjoyed during that time because their labor through slavery had been thoroughly institutionalized most specially in the plantation-based economies of the Southern states.
According to Acemoglu and Robinson, freedom exists in a narrow corridor where it is safeguarded by a strong state and a strong society. These state and societal institutions should be both formidable and inclusive. In their words, Scandinavian countries, most specially Denmark, demonstrate such strengths. Thus the term “Getting to Denmark” becoming a development benchmark in political science and economics.
A state is considered strong when it possesses the capabilities to take on and carry out responsibilities efficiently and handle internal and external shocks effectively. On the other hand, a strong society is characterized by strong familial or patrimonial ties and an ability to mobilize groups of peoples to forward a cause. There are countless instances in world history where state and society have competed to undermine, weaken, and overpower the other. However, when both powers of the state and society effectively and efficiently check and balance each other, where benefits of having a strong state are reaped without upending the society, a “shackled leviathan” exists. It is in this shackled leviathan where genuine freedom exists.
For the Philippines, having a strong state that doesn’t undermine but instead engages the strong civil society is the most important ingredient to lead the country towards Denmark. This makes sense when linked with then-President Gloria Arroyo’s slogan, Matatag na Republika. However, this is easier said than done as both political order and development have the state as one of its three central pillars. Renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s two-part masterpiece about political order may provide us with better insights in enhancing the powers of the Philippine state, which will be discussed in the second part of this article.",Politics
Ph Opposition in desperate search for a leader as failed presidential candidate Leni Robredo flags,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/ph-opposition-in-desperate-search-for-a-leader-as-failed-presidential-candidate-leni-robredo-flags/,"Should Senator Risa Hontiveros now be considered the de facto leader of the opposition as Inquirer columnist Richard Heydarian proposes? Heydarian crowns Hontiveros Leader of the Opposition on the sole bases of her being “the only dissenting voice in the Senate” in the face of overwhelming support for the passing of legislation to implement the Philippines’ first sovereign wealth fund dubbed the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF)…
Even after a supermajority of her colleagues tried to spin their version of the MIF as sufficiently safeguarded, the fiercely independent-minded stateswoman maintained that “the fund is not what we need now” and is yet to “pass the test of economic viability” before being taken seriously. She also made it clear that she “will be watching intently” the implementing rules and regulations of the MIF, once signed into law, to “ensure that the prohibitions we put in place and the wins we were able to secure during the plenary deliberations are not lost.” Far from grandstanding, Hontiveros’ latest intervention echoed her unquestionable track record as the leading “fiscalizer” in our legislature.
To be fair, Hontiveros did win her reelection bid as opposed to former Vice President Leni Robredo who got buried in an avalanche of votes in the 2022 race for the presidency that rival Bongbong Marcos went on to win. Yet Robredo continues to project the image that she’s still the leader of the opposition with Angat-Buhay, which is on a donation soliciting binge with its recently launched website. However the most recent SWS survey shows Robredo lagging behind in the 2025 senatorial race. She’s not even in the top 12 which all but confirms her humiliating defeat last May 2022.
Realistically, between Robredo and Hontiveros, it’s not much of a choice as neither of the two exude intellectual depth and charisma which can sway public opinion to their side. The opposition is wanting for a popular leader which is why they have their sights on neophyte Senator Raffy Tulfo. Tulfo is a masa idol and while he doesn’t have intellectual depth either, his common sense approach to national issues makes it easy for the D and E demographic to identify with him. However, Tulfo isn’t inclined to side with the opposition any time soon because they don’t offer him any specific advantage. He won his seat independently. He was an adopted candidate of the Lacson-Sotto slate but that didn’t offer him much of an edge either as the coalition broke up in the end when Bebot Alvarez jumped to Robredo.
This opens up the possibility of either a third party or a Tulfo alliance with Vice President Sara Duterte should a break occur between Marcos and his VP before 2028. The 2025 midterm election will have an impact on the 2028 presidential race. It remains to be seen how realignments will play out. What sure is the opposition is still dead in the water. Neither Robredo or Hontiveros, is capable of making it rise from the dead.",Politics
On Afghan refugees: Philippines bending so far backwards for the US it risks breaking its back,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/on-afghan-refugees-philippines-bending-so-far-backwards-for-the-us-it-risks-breaking-its-back/,"In his Manila Standard column today, Lito Banayo beseeches the President, “Please listen to your sister”. Banayo refers to the issue of the Afghan refugees that the United States are suggesting should be temporarily accommodated in the Philippines while they are being cleared for resettlement in the US. Banayo credits said sister, Senator Imee Marcos, with consistently taking “an independent stand” to her brother’s and does so now “particularly on the proposal of the American government to send Afghan refugees to the Philippines for ‘processing’.”
Safe to say that he’s playing deaf as the president is surrounded by two Romualdez cousins; Ambassador to the US Babe and House Speaker Martin. To these two, what Uncle Sam wants, Uncle Sam will get. There’s no limit as to what they’re willing to do for as long as they’re in the good graces of our former colonial master.
The South Vietnamese were left behind by the Americans when they were routed  by the North Vietnamese. The boat people fled Vietnam and sought shelter in nearby countries but with the Philippines being the nearest, we ended up with the most number refugees housed in Morong, Bataan and Sta. Lourdes, Palawan where they established Vietville. The rescue of the Vietnamese in the South China Sea waters was humanitarian in nature. What the US wants with the Afghan refugees is an imposition. Why the Philippines to begin with? Probably because we’re not the type to complain and say yes faster than the Americans can finish making the request. The Romualdezes are too eager.
When Presidents Quezon and Quirino welcomed separately Jewish refugees to the country, we had plenty of land to spare as our population in those times were not as large as now when we are bursting at the seams with 114 million and more.
So this is not about being less humanitarian than our predecessors; it is about the coping mechanisms of our economy. It is about national security and threats of terrorism.
The other interesting point brought up by Banayo is the evacuation of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Taiwan in the event hostilities between the US and China erupt. We’re not capable of doing so. It remains to be seen if this has been discussed with the Americans at the level of Babe and Martin.
At this point, Imee is scoring points against her brother and cousin by not  toeing the line. Maybe this is why she’s  not included in the provincial and foreign trips. A gadfly is of little use to the inner circle which has access to the president. For our sake, we need more Imee’s and less Romualdez’s. We aren’t getting much, again, for the access to the EDCA bases. We should be getting more. Let’s not forget that Uncle Sam was willing to use the Covid vaccine as leverage for the VFA.
The Americans don’t give a rat’s ass about us. More than likely they will abandon us like they did in World War II, if they go to war with China. We need to be practical and not be stupid idiots again.",Politics
"Administration split between Marcos, Duterte camps throw shade on US regional designs vs China",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/administration-split-between-marcos-duterte-camps-throw-shade-on-us-regional-designs-vs-china/,"Proof that all is not well within the ruling coalition? Columnist Alex Magno in his PhilStar piece “Overreach” today fearlessly forecasts that “personality clashes that surfaced the past few weeks will become more severe as realignments happen in preparation for the midterm elections.”
At a recent event, Vice-President Sara Duterte professed support for President Marcos Jr. but added that his middle name was unspeakable. That was an obvious jab at House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the President’s first cousin.
The supermajority at the House initially tried to downplay the friction, pleading for unity to accomplish the administration agenda. The past few days, however, their tone has become more confrontational. They now appear readier to deal with the “Sara problem” head on.
Sara is going to face a challenge in 2028 because Uncle Sam will do everything possible to prevent her from becoming president because she will not simply follow their dictates. The American grand design for the region is to stop China’s rise as the economic and military power in Asia. The re-annexation of Taiwan will make China an economic powerhouse with the chip-making foundries of tech giant TSMC.
This is why this early, there is political noise. Look to the administration building its own political coalition. It won’t be under Partido Federal’s umbrella because there is nothing under there. The worst thing that could happen is Lakas becoming the principal member of that coalition. Unlike 2019, which was still administration versus opposition, 2025 is the first shot for 2028. It will involve the members of the ruling coalition being asked to choose sides.
Sara is part of the reason why President Bongbong Marcos remains popular. The moment a break in that alliance happens will be the downfall of one because the political repercussions will be serious. This is what the stupid Opposition is counting on. Even if this does happen, the public still won’t go for them. They will be split between Marcos and Duterte. For now, civility is still the norm. This will change come the new year. The congressmen will go where the money is.
The Senate is another story. Even if Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri is ousted, who will replace him? That’s how low the Senate has gone. There are no Senators who have enough stature to loom large over the institution. The new agrarian emancipation act will be enough to keep the masa satisfied with the administration. But between now and 2025, voters will be concerned about inflation and the militarization brought about by the American access to Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bases.
It’s easy to paint China as the villain. But you only need to look at what’s happening in Ukraine to realize that all the dollars and military equipment the US throws at Ukraine is not enough to win that war. Think about that.",Politics
Inutile Opposition leaves administration factions to carve out the Philippines among themselves,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/inutile-opposition-leaves-administration-factions-to-carve-out-the-philippines-among-themselves/,"Not really sucked the oxygen out, as Opposition columnist Manuel L Quezon III writes in his Inquirer piece “Ruling coalition fiesta”. Eerily quiet is the same as noisy if you think about it. Quezon writes, “With an opposition with no teeth, speculation on ruling coalition intramurals has sucked all the political oxygen out of the room.”
But MLQ3 has something going about charter change if only to make possible Martin becoming Prime Minister since he doesn’t have a chance of becoming President.
Might it be more useful to abolish the Senate, and institute the parliamentary system, which is the tempting alternative for those convinced they can never win a national election? After all, the Senate as an institution, which requires both celebrity and money, is increasingly fated to become an old folks’ home as it is past senators who retain the stature to have viable candidacies.
It really becomes a question what the Inday-GMA-Imee faction will decide on for 2025. Do they break from the administration or do they keep their spot and wait for 2028?
I don’t think that the Marcos family, as a political unit, will be done in 2028. But the cracks are also showing since it’s President Bongbong Marcos and Senator Imee Marcos with the warm bodies; three sons, only two viable enough to run for office and only one who’s active in politics – Sandro and Matthew. The joker in the card game is Rodrigo Duterte. The former president is still all praises about his successor. He knows better than to rock the boat given how Marcos is friendly with the Western powers that be. At this point, Digong doesn’t need the headache of the International Criminal Court (ICC) hanging over his head. But as we all know, when you can’t dispense with the spoils, it’s hard to keep your political house in order.
The oligarchs will go with Marcos over Deputy House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) simply because there are deals to be made, specially with the privatization of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). A little birdie told me that the direction with election IT contractor Smartmatic is now similar with 2019. Since the administration controls it, best not to do away with it.
We can speculate all we want but the proof is in the composition of the administration Senate slate. The Lakas leadership will have to make a choice between GMA and Martin. Sara will need to decide what to do with Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP). Imee still identifies as a Nacionalista. She doesn’t have her own political machinery but relies on support from a bevy of political parties, including Lakas and PDP-Laban.
The Opposition, for its part, can’t find its footing. Amazing how many Pinkidiots were triggered by the tweet about MaDumb marking her wedding anniversary with Jesse again. It’s not that she “lives rent-free” in people’s heads. It’s more about her accepting her fate, which should also be the case with her moronic supporters.
Last but not the least are the also-rans from the 2022 race; Ping Lacson, Manny ‘Pacman’ Pacquiao, Isko Moreno, and Vico Sotto. They’re all going to have to decide what their next move is going to be.
The administration will not be wanting for campaign funds. Once Maharlika is signed, the monies stashed abroad can be brought back home again, if this is really one of the reason why there’s the rush to get it done.
Maybe the powers that be are really looking at running the country like Philippines Inc. This is why the Opposition should be less kamote and more focused on critical analysis. Most millennial voters have complained about this and it’s only really the “marginalized” entitled wokes who continue to profess blind stupid obedience to being Kakampink or Kakamtanga.",Politics
Totally Inday Sara: Life Under Full Blown Totalitarian Rule By 2028 and Beyond,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/totally-inday-sara-life-under-full-blown-totalitarian-rule-by-2028-and-beyond/,"After thirty years of living in the Philippines as a man with Middle Eastern ethnic origins who chose to be naturalized as a Filipino decades ago,
I still have yet to grasp why most Filipinos and their political analysts still cleave to the inappropriate categorizations of political behavior. Most still tend to say that that political behavior is rightist (favoring the status quo or the elite) and leftist (favoring those who are ruled or the masses).
It makes for a messy categorization and thus, doesn’t enable people to rightly choose the kind of leader to handle the reins of governance properly.
Instead of saying a leader is a rightist or leftist, I propose that Filipinos look at their leaders as either demonstrating the behavior of one who is for totalitarianism where people are mere resources that must be controlled or one who is for individual freedoms, protecting people from the control of a political elite with a system of laws enabling them to rule themselves.
Over the past three decades, the Philippines has experienced significant political changes, with shifts in leadership reflecting a battle between republican ideals, characterized by the rule of law as well as the protection of individual liberties, and totalitarian ideals, marked by the rule of men as well as the enforcement of collectivism.
This article aims to examine each of the following Philippine presidents and ascertain whether they leaned towards republican or totalitarian principles: Cory Aquino, Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Benigno Simeon Aquino III, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, and Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
After this very brief survey of these succession of leaders, I wish to present a coming divergence in the path of Philippine political development where the country must choose between House Speaker Martin Romualdez (representing republicanism) and Vice President Inday Sara Duterte Carpio (representing totalitarianism).
1. Cory Aquino – The Republican Icon:
Cory Aquino, the Philippines’ first female president, symbolizes the spirit of republicanism. Her ascent to power following the Marcos dictatorship represented a restoration of democracy and the rule of law. She promoted the 1987 Constitution, which enshrined principles of human rights, checks and balances, an independent judiciary, and a strong legislature. Aquino’s presidency marked a significant milestone in safeguarding democratic institutions and ensuring that the rule of law prevailed.
2. Fidel V. Ramos – Striving for Republicanism:
Fidel V. Ramos demonstrated a commitment to republican ideals throughout his presidency. He emphasized economic reforms and bolstered institutions to promote foreign investments, transparent governance, and an independent judiciary. However, Ramos’s presidency faced challenges in fully realizing republican principles due to various political controversies but overall aimed to strengthen democratic norms.
3. Joseph Ejercito Estrada – A Slide towards Totalitarianism:
Joseph Ejercito Estrada’s presidency witnessed elements of both republican and totalitarian approaches. While initially enjoying widespread popularity, allegations of corruption and autocratic tendencies marred his administration. Estrada’s refusal to be accountable for accusations against him and his eventual impeachment showcased a deviation from republican principles, casting shadows of a more autocratic rule.
4. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo – Struggles with Totalitarianism:
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s presidency faced significant scrutiny, with allegations of electoral fraud and human rights abuses. While she implemented some beneficial economic policies, her administration’s actions suggested an inclination towards totalitarian tendencies. Suppression of dissent, manipulation of institutions, and questionable governance decisions undermined democratic values and weakened the rule of law.
5. Benigno Simeon Aquino III – A Mixed Bag:
Benigno Aquino III’s presidency represented a mixed approach to governance. While he championed some republican ideals, such as transparency and good governance, his administration also faced challenges in fully addressing corruption and improving accountability. Nevertheless, Aquino’s tenure saw attempts to strengthen democratic institutions.
6. Rodrigo Roa Duterte – Totalitarian Leanings:
Rodrigo Duterte’s presidency veered towards a more totalitarian approach. Known for his strongman persona, his administration’s focus on the war on drugs raised concerns regarding extrajudicial killings, deteriorating human rights, and a lack of respect for the rule of law. Actions like attacks on press freedom and advocates further solidified perceptions of Duterte as prioritizing the rule of men over the rule of law.
7. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. – Potential Totalitarianism:
As the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s political lineage raises concerns regarding potential totalitarian leanings. Despite efforts to rehabilitate his family’s image, questions surrounding human rights, corruption, and dictatorship persist. With these factors in mind, the potential for a return to totalitarianism under his leadership cannot be dismissed. Although, we must note, that being not of the disposition of a typical totalitarian leader, he has stronger tendencies veering towards republicanism.
The political landscape of the Philippines has witnessed a dynamic interplay between republican and totalitarian ideals. While some leaders, such as Cory Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos, have championed republican principles and strengthened democratic institutions, others, like Joseph Estrada, Gloria Arroyo, Rodrigo Duterte, and potentially Ferdinand Marcos Jr., displayed concerning tendencies towards authoritarianism. Understanding and acknowledging the different governing styles of each president is crucial for the Filipino electorate as they navigate their country’s democratic future. Upholding republican principles and the rule of law remains essential to safeguarding democracy and ensuring a brighter future for the Philippines.
Moreover, I would propose that during the times that the Philippines veered strongly towards republicanism, the country made the strongest gains in terms of economic growth. Though it would be argued that the Cory Aquino years were characterized by economic doldrums which persisted until the third year of the term of her successor, Fidel V. Ramos, it must be noted that the economy yielded unprecedented growth in 1997 onwards.
Upcoming Divergence: Totalitarian Inday or Republican Martin
Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, the current mayor of Davao City in the Philippines, has gained significant attention for her strong leadership style and uncompromising approach to governance. While some may argue that her leadership represents a form of totalitarian rule, it is essential to examine her policies, actions, and the context in which she operates to understand the implications of her leadership style.
Totalitarian rule is characterized by centralized control, suppression of opposition, and the use of force to maintain power. In the case of Inday Sara Duterte, her leadership style exhibits some characteristics that align with this definition. She is known for her no-nonsense approach, often displaying a tough and authoritarian demeanor. Her strong-handed tactics have gained her popularity among those who appreciate her ability to get things done efficiently.
One of the key aspects that critics point out is Duterte’s suppression of opposition. She has been accused of stifling dissent, particularly through her alleged involvement in the harassment and intimidation of political opponents. There have been reports of journalists and activists being targeted for their criticism of her administration, raising concerns about freedom of speech and the right to dissent.
Additionally, Duterte’s leadership style is often associated with the use of force. Her administration has been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to law enforcement, particularly in the context of the infamous Davao Death Squad. While she denies any direct involvement, the extrajudicial killings that occurred during her father’s tenure as mayor of Davao City have raised questions about her commitment to human rights and due process.
Furthermore, Duterte’s consolidation of power is evident in her family’s political dynasty. Her father, Rodrigo Duterte, served as the mayor of Davao City for over two decades before becoming the president of the Philippines. This concentration of power within a single family raises concerns about the lack of checks and balances and the potential for abuse of authority.
However, it is crucial to consider the context in which Duterte operates. Davao City has long been plagued by high crime rates, corruption, and inefficiency in governance. Duterte’s tough approach can be seen as a response to these challenges, with her focus on maintaining law and order and improving the city’s overall security. Her supporters argue that her leadership style is necessary to combat the deeply entrenched problems that have plagued the city for years.
Moreover, Duterte’s popularity among the Filipino people cannot be ignored. Despite the controversies surrounding her leadership, she has consistently received high approval ratings in various surveys. This suggests that there is a significant portion of the population that sees her as an effective leader who can bring about positive change.
Inday Sara’s leadership style exhibits elements that align with the definition of totalitarian rule, it is essential to consider the context in which she operates. Her tough approach and consolidation of power raise concerns about suppression of opposition, use of force, and lack of checks and balances. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge the challenges she faces and the support she receives from the Filipino people.
House Speaker Martin Romualdez on the other hand most closely represents true republican leadership.
In a world often marred by political turbulence and personal agendas, the concept of true republican leadership seems like a distant ideal. However, House Speaker Martin Romualdez has emerged as a beacon of hope, embodying the principles of a government ruled by laws rather than the whims of men.
Martin Romualdez’s tenure as House Speaker has been marked by his unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law. He firmly believes that a country’s progress and stability can only be achieved when its leaders adhere to the principles of justice, fairness, and equality. Romualdez consistently emphasizes the importance of respecting and abiding by the laws that govern society, ensuring that the nation is guided by a system that transcends the personal interests of individuals.
Romualdez has been instrumental in fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the legislative branch. He understands that a true republican leader must be accountable to the people they serve. Under his leadership, the House of Representatives has implemented measures to enhance legislative transparency, such as live streaming of sessions, public consultations, and the publication of lawmakers’ statements of assets, liabilities, and net worth.
Moreover, Romualdez has championed the passage of landmark legislation that promotes good governance and accountability. By advocating for these reforms, he has paved the way for a more open and participatory government, where the laws are accessible to all citizens and the actions of public officials are subject to scrutiny.
True republican leadership requires the ability to bridge divides and build consensus, and Romualdez has demonstrated his commitment to fostering unity and bipartisanship. He recognizes that a government divided against itself cannot effectively serve the interests of the people.
Romualdez has been successful in encouraging dialogue and cooperation among lawmakers from different political affiliations. By promoting an inclusive and collaborative approach, he has facilitated the passage of crucial legislation that addresses the needs and aspirations of the Filipino people. His ability to forge alliances and find common ground has proven instrumental in achieving tangible results for the nation.
In an era where personal interests often overshadow the greater good, House Speaker Martin Romualdez stands as a true embodiment of republican leadership. Through his unwavering commitment to the rule of law, transparency, accountability, and unity, he represents a return to the fundamental principles that define a government ruled by laws, not the whims of men.

Democracy Will Die With Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/democracy-will-die-with-inday-sara-zimmerman-duterte-carpio/,"Not even a year into her term as Vice President, Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio was caught trying to jump the line of succession leading to the Presidency and this has unmasked her power mad, reptilian character.
The failed plot entailed seizing the House Speakership through former President now Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, having President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. impeached/ousted, and then having herself installed by virtue of constitutional succession.
Thank God that such a treacherous, evil plot was exposed and foiled quickly and decisively. Thus, demonstrating conclusively and for all that the combined serpentine tactics of the the ladies from Central Luzon and Mindanao are no match for the pedigreed performance of the Marcos and Romualdez families that have created the very fabric of Philippine democracy as we know it today.
The political and legal brilliance of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. that pervaded and moved every single moment of his twenty year rule IS the very framework — the very ground — in which all the politicians today build their careers.
WHAT FOOLS would think they could shake the very foundations of Philippine politics?
Inday Sara’s brazen but foiled attempt to seize power from President Ferdinand Junior not only exposes her treacherous nature, but also reveals that barely hidden disdain she has for constitutionally mandated processes and constitutional rights.
But, long before this latest treachery, incidents have trailed Inday’s ascent to the Vice Presidency. Consider that;
She has been accused of being involved in extrajudicial killings during her tenure as mayor of Davao City; she punched a sheriff in 2011 for trying to implement a lawful eviction and demolition order in Davao City; she is said to have misused government funds and property for personal purposes; she cursed a fellow local official and endorsed vigilante justice — which ought have gotten her disbarred; she illegally ousted a vice mayor; she is said to condone the fraud and contraband smuggling done by her family members and friends; and of late, she was accused of harassing unionized public school teachers.
Inday Sara Duterte should not be considered as a presidential candidate in 2028 due to her flouting of democratic processes and democratic rights.
Her actions have shown a disregard for the principles of democracy, which are essential for a leader in a democratic nation. As a public figure, she has a responsibility to uphold these principles and set an example for the citizens.
Duterte’s behavior undermines the democratic rights of the people. Democracy thrives on the participation and engagement of citizens, but her actions suggest a lack of respect for their voices. This can create a dangerous precedent where the rights and opinions of the people are sidelined or ignored.
Her disregard for democratic processes can lead to an erosion of checks and balances within the government. Democracy relies on a system of checks and balances to prevent the abuse of power. By flouting these processes, Duterte sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the very foundations of democracy, potentially leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few.
Her actions can have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and expression. A healthy democracy encourages open dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. However, Duterte’s behavior suggests a tendency to silence dissenting voices, which can stifle the diversity of opinions necessary for a functioning democracy.
Her flouting of democratic processes can erode trust in the government and democratic institutions. Trust is a crucial element in any democracy, as it ensures the legitimacy and stability of the system. When leaders disregard democratic processes, it can lead to a loss of faith in the government and its ability to represent the interests of the people.
Vice President Inday Sara Duterte’s flouting of democratic processes and democratic rights makes her unsuitable as a presidential candidate in 2028.
Democracy relies on leaders who uphold its principles and respect the rights and voices of the people. Her actions undermine these fundamental values and can have detrimental effects on the functioning of a democratic society.
Peace be upon you!

"VP Inday Sara is Thick as Thieves with cGMA, Drops Fellow Visayan Frasco Over Tourism Branding Fiasco",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/vp-inday-sara-is-thick-as-thieves-with-cgma-drops-fellow-visayan-frasco-over-tourism-branding-fiasco/,"A Cebuano friend messaged me and said that he felt betrayed by Vice President Inday Sara Duterte Zimmerman Carpio’s deafening silence on the smear campaign against Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco — daughter of Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia.
“Yang si Inday Duterte nga dali ra nga nagpabutho sa iyang kaparehong Bisaya nga si Christina Frasco, anak sa Gobernador sa Cebu nga si Gwen Garcia, pinaagi sa usa ka panghasi nga kampanya apan nagpabilin nga suportahan ang korap nga Kapampangan nga dugong aso nga si Gloria Macapagal Arroyo bisan pa sa kalisod ug kalisang.”

(English translation: Vice President Inday Sara Duterte Zimmerman Carpio easily drops her fellow visayan Christina Frasco, daughter of Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia, over a smear campaign but sticks with corrupt kapampangan dugong aso Gloria Macapagal Arroyo through thick and thin.)
Having been Duterte Carpio’s spokesperson and practically kinfolk, it would be but natural and also expected of her to at the very least re-affirm her belief in Frasco’s capability to lead the Department of Tourism.
But, alas, her unwillingness to come to Frasco’s aid only reveals the deep narcissistic streak in Inday’s character — a feature of her psychopathic persona. After all, Frasco no longer serves any use to her and as things go with people appointed in the BBM administration, she may be on her way to getting unceremoniously booted out. You see, starting from the time that former Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez was kicked out of the palace, it seem that it has become a recently started tradition for appointees targeted for getting the boot to first get scandalized for either corruption or gross ineptitude.
In stark contrast, Inday Sara sticks close or, in a manner of saying, thick as thieves with former president and congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
In 2018, they joined forces with former Ilocos Norte governor Imee Marcos to remove then-speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, marking their first and most notable collaboration.
Their strong relationship is once again in the spotlight following Arroyo’s unexpected demotion from senior deputy speaker to deputy speaker of the 19th Congress. This move surprised even some members of Lakas-CMD, the dominant party in the House of Representatives.
Just two days later, on May 19, Duterte publicly declared her “irrevocable resignation” from Lakas-CMD, the party that had facilitated her ascent to the vice presidency.
In the realm of politics, hypocrisy can be a prevalent and disheartening characteristic. It is essential to hold our leaders accountable for their actions, especially when they claim to champion the interests of their constituents.
Perhaps the following analysis would shed light on the alleged hypocrisy and exploitation surrounding Duterte Carpio — undoubtedly the most prominent figure in Visayan politics.
One of the allegations against Inday Sara Duterte is her alleged manipulation of regional sentiments for political advantage. While she claims to be a champion of Visayan rights and interests, her actions often contradict her rhetoric. Critics argue that she uses her Visayan identity as a tool to gain support, yet fails to address the core issues faced by the Visayan population. This raises questions about her sincerity and commitment to the betterment of her constituents.
Another aspect of Inday Sara Duterte’s alleged hypocrisy lies in her lack of transparency and accountability. Despite being a public figure, she has been accused of operating behind closed doors, making decisions without proper consultation or public input. This lack of transparency raises concerns about her commitment to democratic principles and the welfare of the Visayan people.
Critics argue that Inday Sara Duterte has used her position of power to further her own political ambitions rather than focusing on the development and progress of Visayas. They claim that she prioritizes personal interests and alliances over the needs of her constituents. This alleged exploitation of power raises questions about her true intentions and commitment to serving the people.
She has been criticized for her failure to address pressing socioeconomic issues faced by the Visayan population. Critics argue that her focus on personal and political gains has overshadowed the urgency of addressing poverty, unemployment, and inadequate infrastructure. This alleged negligence further strengthens the argument that she is more interested in personal gain than in genuinely serving the Visayan people.
Peace be upon you!

"Inday Sara: A Lousy VP, A Lousy Education Secretary, and A Lousy Anti Terrorism Talking Head",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/inday-sara-a-lousy-vp-a-lousy-education-secretary-and-a-lousy-anti-terrorism-talking-head/,"If you were born yesterday or part of the Duterte cult, you’d think that Inday Sara Duterte Carpio is such a supergenius like Elon Musk that she can lead three distinct roles in government exceptionally well. But being a mediocre and petulant political brat, she’s doing poorly as a Vice President, Education Secretary and Co Vice Chair of the enormously bloated (NTF ELCAC) National Task Force on Ending Local Communist Armed Conflict.
As an education secretary, her brightest success has been to alienate thousands of bureaucrats and public school teachers by ordering the scrutiny of Automatic Pay Deductions for unions. Regardless of whether or not the leftist group Alliance of Concerned Teachers (a union and also a Party List Group) was being targeted and profiled in the memorandum issued by Inday Sara, it was regarded as an overreach if not outright meddling into public school teachers’ right to self organization.
Right then and there is a sign that Inday Sara is mixing up her role as Education Secretary with being Co Vice Chair of the NTF ELCAC, an organization that is primarily a military undertaking in the guise of the stupidly coined “Whole of Nation” approach.
And as far as bringing in military or rather despotic approach towards managing the country’s education system, Josephus Jimenez writes in Philippine Star’s Freeman about the militarization of DepEd.
“Going back to DepEd, why are the many career CESO officers being bypassed for outsiders who aren’t educators but military men? I know many competent regional directors, division superintendents, district supervisors, principals, and master teachers. Is this a purposive and department-wide militarization of DepEd? Is this an indication that Inday Sara wants teachers to see that she will not tolerate the progressive and sometimes radical styles of ACT and other militant unions? This kind of stance may be good for DND but never among educators in the academe and scholastic havens. I wonder how the UP activists would look at these strong-arm tendencies of the DepEd secretary.”
As for her role as Vice Co-Chair of NTF ELCAC, her last publicly visible act was to attend a meeting of some sort and that was mostly it. So far, there is no word on whether she has acted on behalf of the organization or even supported it through her OVP funds. But some are suspected that she may have a hand in directing the flow of NTF ELCAC’s P9 billion Barangay Development Funds. The funds are supposed to incredulously build everything from roads, clinics, schools, power and water facilities — all of which could have been done through DPWH, DOH, DEPED and other agencies whose mandate it is to provide these infrastructure.
As a Vice President… She’s doing poorly in that department as well. You see, the Philippine Vice President’s only job is to take over the Presidency in the event that the duly elected president dies or is incapacitated or ousted.
I hope people remember her failed ploy with former President Now Congresswoman Gloria Arroyo to unseat House Speaker Martin Romualdez and then usurp the Malacanang by impeaching then ousting President Bongbong Marcos.
And yet, we have people idolizing Inday Sara Duterte. For what?
If she had not sprung forth from the loins of her ugly father, she’d be nothing. She ain’t got brains, charm, or a face that would catch a second look.
Peace be upon you!

"Inday Sara Duterte, Political Idolatry, and the Delayed Evolution of Philippine Politics",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/inday-sara-duterte-political-idolatry-and-the-delayed-evolution-of-philippine-politics/,"I find myself compelled to write this rather long blogpost because people reading my previous writings may have gotten the mistaken impression that I am pro-Marcos.
In fairness, my glowing commentary in previous articles regarding President Bongbong Marcos and his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, may have contributed to this. However, these favorable opinions have to be seen in the context of the articles themselves, where I proposed that Marcos and Romualdez more closely resembled republican leaders (in the sense of cleaving to the rule of law; and where Vice President Inday Sara Duterte represented totalitarianism (in the sense of cleaving to a rule of one or many persons).
Beyond this, Marcos and Romualdez suffer the same flaws found in Inday Sara or any other politician in any other part of the world.
However, their power and rule is emanates from the country’s system of laws whereby Inday Sara’s power purportedly comes from the personal allegiance of millions of blind followers or, at the very least, comes from people who have the allegiance of millions of people.
Marcos and Romualdez, although definitely being the most able to manipulate the country’s legal systems to produce their desired outcome, can only operate within the bounds of that system. Inday Sarah, because of her power over loyal followers, can and has operated beyond the bounds of this system — which is the very reason why the International Criminal Court is subjecting her to an investigation of crimes against humanity.
If I were to admit favoring one politician over the other, I would have to concede that I favor the Marcos and Romualdez because there is at least some system of laws that can mitigate their excesses whereas there would be no way to control Inday Sara if she manages to arm her followers or gain armed followers.
Which is probably Marcos’ wisdom behind not giving her the Department of National Defense and instead giving it to Gilberto Teodoro.
I suppose the Marcoses — perhaps through Sandro or another member of the clan — can gain followers that are comparable in size and allegiance as that of Sara’s but probably not any time soon.
However, all that has to happen to Sara is for her legal hold over the presidency to be challenged and that time may be soon, depending on whether the ICC can actually come over to the Philippines to assert its authority. In which case, it could be possible for Inday Sara to operate as Vice President from a satellite office in Mindanao and that would make it even more difficult for the ICC to serve her an arrest warrant.
Can you imagine the horrors that would come out of such a predicament? I can and it sends chills to my bones.
All that said, is the reason why I write to warn people against Sara and the political idolatry that she represents.
But what is political idolatry? This is a discussion that many students of politics may find worthy of examining.
Idol worship, also known as idolatry, refers to the veneration or worship of physical objects or representations believed to embody or symbolize divine powers or entities. These objects, often referred to as idols, can take various forms, including statues, paintings, amulets, or even natural elements like trees or stones. The act of idol worship involves offering prayers, making offerings, and seeking blessings or guidance from the deity believed to be present within the idol.
Idol worship predates recorded history and has been an integral part of human spirituality in diverse cultures. Ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Mayans all engaged in some form of idol worship. These societies believed that the idols represented their gods or goddesses and served as a means of communication with the divine realm. For instance, the Egyptians revered statues of their deities as vessels through which the gods could interact with humanity.
Idol worship holds significant religious and cultural value in various faiths around the world. Hinduism, for instance, embraces the practice of idol worship as an integral part of its spiritual tradition. Hindus believe that the idols, known as murtis, are not mere representations but rather embodiments of divine energy. Through the act of worshiping these murtis, devotees establish a personal connection with the deities and seek their blessings and guidance.
Similarly, in Buddhism, the use of statues or images of the Buddha serves as a focal point for meditation and contemplation. Buddhists do not consider the statues as divine beings but rather as reminders of the Buddha’s teachings and the path to enlightenment.
Idol worship has often faced criticism, particularly from monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These faiths emphasize the worship of an unseen, formless deity and consider idol worship as a form of idolatry, which is strictly prohibited. Critics argue that the veneration of idols can lead to the worship of false gods or distract individuals from the true essence of spirituality.
However, it is essential to acknowledge that idol worship is not necessarily a literal act of worshiping the physical object itself. Instead, it can serve as a medium through which believers express their devotion and connect with the divine. The idol serves as a focal point, a tangible representation of the intangible divine presence.
Idol worship is a complex and multifaceted practice that has endured throughout human history. It holds deep religious and cultural significance in various traditions, allowing believers to establish a tangible connection with the divine. While it has faced criticism and misunderstanding, it is crucial to approach the topic with an open mind and respect for the diverse beliefs and practices of different cultures and religions.
The Philippines, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage, is a melting pot of diverse customs, beliefs, and traditions. Among the many aspects that shape the Filipino identity, idolatry stands out as a fascinating phenomenon deeply ingrained in the country’s culture.
To understand the roots of idolatry in the Philippines, we must trace back to the pre-colonial period, when indigenous tribes inhabited the archipelago. These tribes believed in an animistic worldview, attributing spirits and divine powers to various objects and natural elements. These objects, such as stones, trees, and animals, were revered as sacred and worshipped as idols.
With the arrival of Spanish colonizers in the 16th century, the religious landscape of the Philippines underwent a significant transformation. The Spanish introduced Christianity, particularly Catholicism, which gradually blended with the existing animistic beliefs. This fusion gave rise to a unique form of idolatry, where the veneration of saints and religious icons became an integral part of Filipino religious practices.
Idolatry, in the context of Philippine culture, extends beyond religious rituals. It permeates various aspects of Filipino society, shaping social norms, values, and even political landscapes. The devotion to religious icons and saints is deeply embedded in the daily lives of Filipinos, with numerous festivals and processions held throughout the country to honor these idols.
These festivals, such as the Sinulog Festival in Cebu or the Pahiyas Festival in Lucban, Quezon, not only celebrate religious figures but also serve as platforms for community unity and cultural preservation. They showcase the Filipinos’ unwavering faith and their collective identity, reinforcing the importance of idolatry as a cultural practice.
As time progressed, idolatry in Philippine culture underwent significant changes, adapting to the evolving needs and beliefs of the Filipino people. The veneration of religious icons expanded beyond the confines of churches and religious ceremonies, finding its way into homes and personal spaces.
Filipino households often have a designated altar or a small shrine where religious icons are displayed and honored. These altars serve as focal points for prayer, meditation, and a sense of spiritual connection. They represent a deep-seated belief in the power of these idols to intercede on behalf of the faithful, providing comfort and guidance in times of need.
However, it is important to note that idolatry in the Philippines is not limited to religious figures alone. Modern-day idols, such as celebrities, politicians, or even sports icons, have also emerged as objects of adoration. This phenomenon reflects the changing dynamics of Philippine society, where idolatry extends beyond the realm of spirituality and intertwines with other aspects of daily life.
Idolatry in Philippine culture is a multifaceted phenomenon that intertwines religious beliefs, cultural practices, and societal norms. Its historical origins, rooted in indigenous animistic traditions, have evolved over time, adapting to the influences of Spanish colonization and modern-day dynamics. The veneration of religious icons and saints remains a prominent feature of Filipino society, serving as a testament to the deep faith and cultural pride of the Filipino people.
While idolatry in the Philippines may be viewed differently by individuals, it is essential to recognize and respect its significance in shaping the country’s cultural landscape. As we continue to explore and celebrate the diversity of cultures around the world, understanding and appreciating the role of idolatry in Philippine culture can foster greater intercultural dialogue and appreciation.
In today’s political landscape, it is not uncommon to witness the elevation of political leaders to near-deity status. This phenomenon, known as political idolatry, poses a significant threat to the democratic principles upon which our society is built.
Political idolatry refers to the excessive veneration, adoration, or worship of political figures, often bordering on blind loyalty and devotion. It occurs when individuals place their trust, hopes, and aspirations solely in the hands of a particular leader, disregarding critical thinking and independent analysis.
The Dangers of Political Idolatry:
1. Erosion of Democracy: Political idolatry undermines the principles of democratic governance by discouraging healthy skepticism, dissent, and constructive criticism. It can lead to the consolidation of power, enabling leaders to make decisions unchallenged, without being held accountable for their actions.
An example of this is how VP Inday Sara has reportedly appointed retired military officials in key controlling positions of the bureaucracy of the Department of Education and issued a memo targeting all unionized public school teachers. Both acts tend to show evidence of iron-fisted control over the organization where orders are issued rather than inspiring productive collaboration and where the assertion of the right to organize is put under close scrutiny, possibly for the purpose of which acts can be held liable for violations of the Anti Terrorism Law.
2. Polarization and Division: Idolizing political figures often leads to the creation of an “us versus them” mentality, fostering polarization and deepening societal divisions. This can hinder meaningful dialogue and compromise necessary for the functioning of a healthy democracy.
This is something that we saw emerge during the term of former President Duterte where even friends and family were divided over their opinions about his rule.
3. Suppression of Individual Thought: Political idolatry discourages critical thinking and independent analysis, as blind allegiance to a leader’s ideas becomes the norm. This suppression of individual thought can hinder the development of innovative solutions and stifle progress.
Remember, if you will, the tax case filed against the Prietos who owned the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the closure of ABS-CBN, and the litigious attitude of government officials who filed libel charges against journalists that question their integrity.
4. Diminished Public Discourse: When political idolatry takes hold, public discourse often devolves into personal attacks, character assassinations, and the spread of misinformation. This toxic environment hampers constructive debates and prevents the exploration of alternative perspectives.
Who hasn’t experienced being trolled or cancelled by so-called Duterte Diehard Simps? There have been many social media influencers, celebrities, and officials who have been attacked by so-called DDS for criticizing Duterte — the father and the daughter.
Political idolatry poses a significant threat to the democratic fabric of our society. By understanding its implications and recognizing the dangers it entails, we can strive to foster a political culture that values critical thinking, healthy skepticism, and respectful discourse. It is imperative to remain vigilant and engage in open-minded discussions that challenge our own beliefs and those of our political leaders. Only then can we safeguard the principles upon which our democracy is built and ensure a better future for all.
Peace be upon you!

ICC to Issue Warrant of Arrest for Vice President Inday Zimmerman Duterte Carpio,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/icc-to-issue-warrant-of-arrest-for-vice-president-inday-zimmerman-duterte-carpio/,"In her article on the inclusion of Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio in the International Criminal Court investigation on human rights abuses in the Philippines, veteran journalist Ellen Tordesillas possibly unveiled the reason why Duterte Carpio attempted to unseat President Bongbong Marcos through a now failed attempt to wrest the House Speakership and initiate impeachment proceedings that she hopes would lead to his ouster.
The article in Vera Files reads:
Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio and two incumbent senators were named in documents submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigating the killings related to the drug war during the previous administration and when Duterte was mayor of Davao City, a copy of the documents obtained by VERA Files shows.
The vice president’s name was mentioned as knowing and approving the killings when she was city mayor, a post that her father held for more than 20 years. Sara was mayor from 2010 to 2013, and from 2016 to 2022.
A person knowledgeable of the ICC probe said she could be issued a “summons” by the ICC. If she would not comply with the summons, she would be issued a warrant of arrest.
This is the very first time the name of Sara has been mentioned  in documents relevant to the ICC investigation.
(Read the full article here.)
The article presents substantial evidence implicating Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and two incumbent senators in the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) investigation into the drug war-related killings during Duterte’s administration. The inclusion of high-ranking officials in the investigation highlights the seriousness of the allegations and the need for accountability.
Respecting the International Criminal Court and cooperating with its investigations is essential for upholding international human rights standards. By actively participating in the ICC’s proceedings, the Philippines can demonstrate its commitment to justice and the rule of law. This will not only contribute to addressing past human rights abuses but also help in preventing future violations.
One of the significant advantages of regaining an international reputation for compliance with international human rights standards is the potential for economic benefits. By showing a genuine commitment to human rights and justice, the Philippines can attract foreign investments, foster stronger international relations, and enhance its global standing. Investors and international partners are more likely to engage with a country that respects human rights, leading to economic growth and stability.
The inclusion of Sara Duterte-Carpio’s name in the ICC investigation is particularly significant. As a former mayor of Davao City, she held a position of authority and influence during the alleged extrajudicial killings. If the ICC issues a summons for her, it will be crucial for her to cooperate with the court’s proceedings. Failure to comply with the summons may result in a warrant for her arrest, highlighting the international community’s commitment to ending impunity for human rights abuses.
Similarly, the mention of Senators Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go and Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa in the investigation raises important questions about their involvement in the alleged crimes. If sufficient evidence is found against them, they too could face arrest warrants from the ICC. This underscores the need for a thorough and comprehensive investigation that includes all individuals responsible for human rights violations, regardless of their positions or affiliations.
The ICC’s forthcoming judgment on the appeal by the Philippine government will provide further clarity on the jurisdiction and continuation of the investigation. It is vital for the government to respect the ICC’s decision and fully cooperate with the court to ensure a fair and impartial proceeding. Doing so will demonstrate the country’s commitment to upholding international law and sending a strong message that human rights abuses will not be tolerated.
The inclusion of high-ranking officials in the ICC’s investigation emphasizes the importance of respecting the International Criminal Court and its pursuit of justice.
By actively participating in the proceedings, the Philippines can regain its international reputation as a country that respects human rights, potentially leading to economic benefits and stronger international relations.
It is imperative for all individuals implicated in the investigation, including Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio, Senators Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go and Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, to fully cooperate with the ICC to ensure a thorough and comprehensive investigation.

Recent moves by former President Rodrigo Duterte a possible play for the 2025 elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/recent-moves-by-former-president-rodrigo-duterte-a-possible-play-for-the-2025-elections/,"Is it really or not really a jab at Marcos as Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) suggests in his piece today? I think not or maybe yes. MLQ3’s extreme realm of speculation is former President Rodrigo Duterte (PRRD) went to China also to ask President Xi Jinping for political asylum…
There are two other possibilities. One is that as the Philippines snaps back to its old alliances (and, in fact, deepens them), the usefulness of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has ended and Beijing has to signal that its interests (and backing) are fully enjoyed by Duterte now. The other possibility is that, with neck braces now being out of fashion, the former president went under cover of being a medical tourist but what he’s actually after is a promise of asylum.
Harebrained is how I would describe that. Hand Duterte over to International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction and the government will see people going out onto the streets. If that ever happens, Duterte will hole up in Mindanao and not in China. It’s likely he’ll try to bring down the government as well so that makes it far-fetched.
What this meeting may signify is Duterte making a play for 2025. He still has PDP-Laban as his political flag of convenience. There are Bong Go, Bato delay Rosa, Francis Tolentino and “Idol” in the Senate. There is Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) still with her political influence. But the oligarchs who used to back GMA are definitely not going to choose her over President Bongbong Marcos (BBM) given how they’re having it so good “working” closely with the President. They never actually had it so good until now.
Definitely the campaign funds will flow into the administration slate come 2025 but the pertinent question is the composition of that slate and who will be the remaining members of the UniTeam coalition. Vice President Sara Duterte still can’t make a public break from Marcos. She can only go after House Speaker Martin “Tambaloslos” Romualdez but BBM won’t tolerate any open conflict between the two. Such is the predicament Sara and GMA find themselves in.
PRRD is more flexible. He has praised Marcos but is openly against the additional Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) bases without directly sniping at Apo Lakay Jr. But here’s the rub, Vicente Duterte died one year after his failed bid for Congressman after Landring Almendras and the late former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay Sr” E. Marcos. dumped him. Even if Digong didn’t have a good relationship with his father, blood will always be thicker than water. It’s his last hurrah. If he feels compelled to get back at Marcos for what is now the second slight over the Sara and Martin tiff then he will make his move but not to the point of destablizing the Marcos administration.
Digong is the consummate political poker player. He doesn’t let anyone see his cards. I’m sure that keen political pundits have seen through Marcos’ weakness. Even Manang Senator Imee Marcos realizes it which is why she’s distancing herself from her ading politically. She’s still part of the Duterte-GMA alliance.
There is no love lost between her and her cousin. Imee also has an eye for the Presidency. The best way for Martin to become Marcos’ successor is for him to become Prime Minister because he won’t win in a national race against either Sara or Imee. Digong’s ace card now is running for Senator in 2025. That would change the power structure in the Senate and in that position, he can extract concessions from Marcos. Abangan.",Politics
President Bongbong Marcos’s 2023 State of the Nation Address (SONA): Great Expectations vs Stark Reality,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/president-bongbong-marcoss-2023-state-of-the-nation-address-sona-great-expectations-vs-stark-reality/,"The President Wil deliver his second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday July 24, 2023. The pre-SONA information drive of the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) has been harping on the positive gains since the first one last year. What has President Bongbong Marcos (BBM) achieved in his first year in office?
The New Agrarian Emancipation Act stands out among the legislation passed by the Senate and House under Senate President Miguel Zubiri and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. It is landmark agrarian legislation equaled only by the late former President Ferdinand E. Marcos — Apo Lakay‘s Presidential Decree (PD) No. 27 — which declared the entire country an agrarian reform area. But what else after this? Not much.
I had high  expectations of Marcos. The hope was that since he had seen what happened since 1986, he’d knew exactly what needed to be done to put the country on the right path again. Instead, there is the Maharlika sovereign fund and the pivot to the US which effectively makes the Philippines the equivalent of China’s reclaimed defensive perimeter in the South China Sea. After he declared martial law, in 1972, Marcos Sr (PFEM) went after the drug lords, the oligarchs, political warlords, and the cartels. The tag line was Sa Ikauunlad ng Bayan, Disiplina ang Kailangan (“To ensure national progress, discipline is essential”). We haven’t seen any of these from Junior. No iron fist. BBM is more like a CEO than the leader of the country which should’ve been more progressive than its regional counterparts.
The reality is even Vietnam has passed us by and we are actually regressing instead of progressing. Filipinos gave Marcos enormous political capital but he hasn’t used the same wisely. Marcos has surrounded himself with the oligarchs who supported his presidential bid and hasn’t made it a priority to amend the Constitution, particularly with respect to the economic provisions.
Let’s put it this way, other southeast Asian countries have their share of cronies but they aren’t gatekeepers. In our case, even with legislation passed to liberalize certain sectors, the playing field still isn’t level because there are the corporate political parties and the politicians in the pockets of the oligarchs. Good if they are all investing their profits back in the country but you see them diversifying operations in the region, with some like ICTSI, being global players.
Then there is disiplina. It’s high time that the Pinoy learned about the concept. As it is, it’s been a free-for-all since 1986 which is why we have bedlam in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the regional urban centers. There is no long-term planning. We haven’t plugged the infrastructure deficit and quality of life continues to deteriorate. I can’t “love” the Philippines if the damned jeepneys are still on the roads and what is “Bagong Pilipinas” if there is no plan for radical reform such as a change in the form of government?
The general sentiment is “di ko ramdam si BBM”. Former President Rodrigo Duterte had a mayoral demeanor which is what endeared him to the average Pinoy. In contrast, the “presidential” Marcos is statesmanlike but that won’t get us anywhere. What we need is combination of a statesman and a “bastonero” in Muntinlupa, which is what Apo Lakay was at his peak. You can be a bastonero in barong anyway. The pomp and circumstance is back in the presidency but are we just going to continue to be gawkers at the rich and the famous and the high and mighty? What is it that’s said about the measure of a country having social equality if the rich take mass transport just like any other Juan and Kulasa? The President tools around in a Mercedes in the capital and a luxury SUV when in tbe regions. The optics are good but that doesn’t solve my primary problem of my P1,000 only being able to buy half of a large brown bag of groceries given the present level of inflation.
Our leaders continue to pander to both the rich and the poor to the point that the poor are entitled enough to demand ayuda while the rich dole out charity as consuelo de bobo for the same kind of entitlement they get from their political lackeys. The vicious cycle has to stop if we’re to catch up with our regional neighbors. It doesn’t look as if this is going to be a possibility in the next five years.",Politics
Repivot of Philippine foreign policy back to the US under BBM steals thunder from traditional anti-China Opposition rhetoric,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/repivot-of-philippine-foreign-policy-back-to-the-us-under-bbm-steals-thunder-from-traditional-anti-china-opposition-rhetoric/,"The tone Inquirer columnist Randy David himself takes in his piece “Foreign policy in [Marcos’s SONA]” likely mirrors the conundrum he and members of his camp find themselves in today. President Bongbong Marcos is the archenemy of the Opposition and yet he has co-opted their agenda of bringing the Philippines back into America’s arms. This is why the leftist-militants are a lost cause. They don’t have any ideological underpinning. Its all about a seat at the table of power. The romanticism associated with being a rebel has been lost. At least the Yellowidiots continue to tout neoliberal ideology, which resonates with Gen Z and the millennials.
David writes;
Duterte’s recent audience with [China’s President Xi Jinping], in which the Chinese leader praised him for “resolutely [making] the strategic choice to improve relations with China in an attitude of being responsible to the people and to history” and admonished him to “continue to play an important role in the friendly cooperation” between the two countries, is nothing less than a slap on the face of Mr. Marcos. It has no precedent. Not even Mr. Marcos’ admission that he knew about the visit and that he “welcome[s] any new lines of communication,” could remove the sting from that scarcely veiled rebuke.
Was former President Rodrigo Duterte’s China visit really an affront to Marcos as David asserts? It can be construed as such but the cover was the former president was there to see the school which the Chinese built to honor his mother. A picture speaks a thousand words and the difference in the demeanor of Xi when Marcos went on a state visit as opposed to the optics of Xi meeting Duterte was obvious. Xi made sure that the optics conveyed his preference of Duterte over Marcos.
Duterte is the consummate political player. He didn’t say anything but with Xinhua, China’s official state news agency, releasing the story with the accompanying picture, the message was conveyed to the intended recipient. Duterte continues to enjoy a direct line to Xi. Pragmatically, it can also be spun to point out that the former president made representations with Xi to convey that not all Filipinos are pro-America. This is important in case Uncle Sam decides to provoke China into a conflict in the South China Sea similar to what happened in Ukraine with Russia.
Ultimately, it boils down to a choice between the two hegemons; China or the US. The world has changed so much that it can’t be the usual good-versus-evil narrative that the Americans have been playing since they became dominant with Pax Americana. By the end of the 18th century, the American defense perimeter began with the Philippines. China is only claiming the South China Sea. We must not forget the US reaction when the USSR built missile bases in Cuba. This is why Russia went into Ukraine. It’s nothing but a proxy war with Ukraine on the losing end.
Since March, the US has been conducting non-stop exercises with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and its regional allies. AUKUS, the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US, is set to become the region’s equivalent of Western Europe’s North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). The other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will not allow this and it is unfortunate that we are again identified as the American lackey in the region.
David himself understands the risk this entails but his regret is the fact that it wasn’t the Opposition that delivered on the American demand, but Marcos because he prioritized his family’s vindication before the world instead of the welfare of his countrymen. It remains to be seen what Marcos has planned after the midpoint of his term. By that time, Filipinos will have come to their own conclusions. This is why the other political players are looking at 2025 already. The same is true with Duterte. He’s keeping his cards close to his chest but he’s made it clear to the current administration that they can’t afford to take him lightly or even write him off.",Politics
Impending ICC Arrest Warrant Derails Inday Sara Duterte Carpio’s Presidential Ambition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/impending-icc-arrest-warrant-derails-inday-sara-duterte-carpios-presidential-ambition/,"Would we want a fugitive for a President? Because, in all likelihood, that is what Inday Sara Duterte Carpio will be if she wins the presidency and if the International Criminal Court sentences her guilty of whatever crimes she might be accused of.
It is very likely that Inday Sara’s presidential ambitions may go sideways similar to the way senator Grace Poe’s presidential run.
Although, in Poe’s case, what derailed her presidential campaign was the question of her citizenship and it was enough for people to junk their support for her. Sara’s case, however, is much worse than that as it involves allegations of killing purported criminals and political opponents — the murder of hundreds of people.
That’s just the allegations involving the killing of people. We haven’t even gotten into the allegations involving her supposed connection to other crimes like smuggling, swindling, and corrupt practices.
The possibility of having a criminal as President is the thing that we Philippine citizens must consider very seriously right now, even though the International Criminal Court is still a long way from handing down a sentence against former President Rodrigo Duterte, Inday Sara Duterte Carpio, and others being investigated for so-called crimes against humanity.
It is a very real possibility that Inday Sara will be sentenced guilty along with her father.
After all, who hasn’t heard former President Rodrigo Duterte talk about the Davao Death Squad and other such stories of killing people he claims to be criminals? These statements by the former President were regarded as true by his followers and were among the reasons why many supporters his bid for the presidency in 2016.
Let’s not forget that some of the highlights of his presidency included:
Duterte got away with saying so many atrocious things like a “rockstar” during his presidency but now, faced with an ICC probe on his alleged human rights abuses, he ought to start acting more meekly and humbly. You know, kinda like those tough guys detained by the police, the ones we see almost regularly on Philippine TV news.

Continued Shrinking of VP Inday Sara’s Political Capital,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/continued-shrinking-of-vp-inday-saras-political-capital/,"Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio was probably under the delusion that she is anything like her father when she tried to ape his penchant for bold and daring moves only to fall on her bloated, mannish face.
Only former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte can be called a “rockstar” president because he was reasonably assured that his outrageous and colorful antiques would not make a dent on the political capital he had nurtured over decades of public service. Having established good relations with almost every major political elite family and mastered the common touch, Duterte’s antic of cursing the Pope and questioning the wisdom of God himself reaped more applause than the pious rancor of so-called God fearing elite Filipinos.
Now, emerging out from under her father’s wing, VP Inday Sara is soon realizing just how greatly her political career was buoyed by her father’s political capital.
Being a brash and immature political player in the national scene, her attempt at wrestling power from President Bongbong Marcos through a coup of the House Speaker and then an impeachment complaint that would lead to his ouster mortally damaged her relations with the incumbent administration.
Her resignation from the ruling party, Lakas, was not out of some manner of delicadeza but something she was forced to do after being outed as the architect and chief beneficiary of the failed power play.
As if that weren’t bad enough, the International Criminal Court has threatened to issue a warrant of arrest should she refuse to respond to its summons.
This further diminishes her political capital as she as well as her father is now at the mercy of the President and perhaps even both houses of congress — lest they allow the ICC to come into the country and take them into custody.
I can only imagine how the sight of VP Inday and former President Duterte in handcuffs would affect their followers.
For sure, much indignation will be shown. But in time, this will die down because no follower or fan — however loyal — would ever want to share the fate of their “idols”.
But more than that, I don’t think it would be prudent for the Marcos administration to lay it all down the line just to keep the Duterte’s outside of the reach of the ICC. That would mean staking their own political capital for the Dutertes, one of which had shown treachery despite the gracious treatment accorded to her.
Moreover, continued harboring of the Dutertes would imperil the good will of the internaitonal community and this is something the Marcos administration — nay, the country itself — needs.
Even if, for the sake of argument, the Marcos administration risks its own political capital for the Dutertes, how would Inday Sara campaign effectively in 2028 as she is badgered about being an international fugitive?
Some would say, “The Marcoses did it and they committed even worse atrocities.”
To which I would say, it took them four decades to rise back to power and perhaps a considerable portion of their wealth.
The Dutertes, on the other hand, have neither the benefit of the passage of time nor the immense resources necessary to mount an effective comeback into power.
Peace be upon you!

Inday Sara’s Cosplay and Snub By BBM,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/inday-saras-cosplay-and-snub-by-bbm/,"Days after President Bongbong Marcos’ second State of the Nation Address, I still find myself gagging over the en faire tout un fromage over our political elite’s so-called red carpet pageantry.
I don’t recall when traditional news media started featuring the fashion statements of this country’s politicians, but it should stop because it detracts from what in most instances is a non-event for the most part — as it should be.
The yearly SONA is after all, just a report of what was accomplished by the country’s leaders in the previous year and what it intends to achieve in the year ahead. It is merely ceremonial and, let’s face it, what a third world country’s leadership says really has little or no effect on the rest of the world.
It is a checkbox long list of checkboxes that must be ticked off by the President.
So, adding a “red carpet gala” to this already tedium doesn’t improve it at all and has the effect of drowning a chewy steak with barbecue sauce. It just accentuates its banality even more and haunts you with an acrid lingering taste.
The bangaw on top of this bureaucratic affair in the nation’s House of Representatives is the appearance of Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio in a moro costume. Her NPC (non playable character) followers are all agog about how much better it is from former Vice President Leni Robredo’s samurai costume.
If it did anything at all for her, the moro cosplay only displayed her banality and accentuated her dumpling-esque shape.
But it’s really no wonder that she displays this craving for attention and I do pity her for having suffered neglect as well as abandonment from her father during her childhood years. It’s just so sad to see her “daddy issues” having to play out using the country’s money.
I also feel both pity and sense of relief for President Bongbong Marcos. I pity him for having to put up with Inday Sara, as it was necessary for him to create a political alliance with her and now that such an alliance has already achieved its purpose, he must distance himself from her unless she drags him down when much still has to be done for his nation.
The so-called snubbing of Sara is indicative of the state of her plummeting political capital. It was unfortunate that her NPC publicity people had to accentuate it even more with photos of her arm in arm with House Speaker Martin Romualdez.
Watching her going through this rigmarole of pretending to still be in the good graces of those who footed the bill of her rise from provincial despot to the vice presidency has all the charms of a dog eating its own vomit.
To be honest, I understand Bonget more than Inday and because of this, it is natural for me to sympathize with him. Unlike Sara who has an innate insecurity because of poor parental upbringing and being a Mindanawon who feels compelled to show superiority to the Manileño, Bonget has never used public events to call attention to himself or salve some childhood trauma. He represents his early education well.

Filipinos suffering ‘effigy fatigue’ as traditional “activists” exhibit a profound imagination deficit in SONA 2023 antics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/filipinos-suffering-effigy-fatigue-as-traditional-activists-exhibit-a-profound-imagination-deficit-in-sona-2023-antics/,"Anti-Marcos rhetoric. What else, right? It’s not as if we could expect anything more of the Philippines’ traditional “activists” who are beavering away over the weekend to prepare for the usual antics expected of them on the occasion of Monday’s State of the Nation Address (SONA).
It is interesting then that Yellowtard Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco writes today a piece titled “Slogans over substance”…
…our government’s obsession with new logos and slogans is rooted in a desire to project a false sense of novelty and achievement, while actually masking old and problematic ways of thinking and doing.
Lasco may as well be describing his own people who have so far, over the last five decades, neither backed their slogans with substance nor shown tangible results having, to be fair,  walked their proverbial talk with their countryside terrorism. Even then, the walk nowadays is anything but badass seeing that pink still colours much of leftist rhetoric — a holdover from the Opposition “led” by former “vice president” Leni Robredo that cost them the 2022 national elections.
Mere stunts won’t win back the nation the Yellowtard-Communist Axis lost over three consecutive election years. The traditional  Opposition need to come up with compelling content to fill Filipinos’ timelines and ditch the old Martial Law Crybaby rhetoric that has made them a mere punchline in national politics. One of their own bloggers, Katrina Stuart-Santiago has long been calling out her people to take action and institute deep reforms in the way they think. In her most recent piece “(Middle Class) Crisis: Why rising from May 2022 has been difficult” she writes of their camps’ catastrophic losses…
When so many are (still!) in denial about the electoral outcomes, still insisting that we were cheated of an election, still insisting that surveys (even the most recent one!) spread disinformation. Because critical, difficult conversations are unwelcome, we have yet to process what went wrong (and what the other side did right) in 2022, and so many of us have just gone back to living our lives the way we do — by paddling along, surviving inflation, and for middle-class stuck-in-the-Philippines-us, just living off whatever self-care routines we can still afford.
Evidently, even Stuart-Santiago’s is a small voice in a community of screeching social climbers. That’s a shame, because Filipinos deserve a better Opposition — better than even the “new” one that is emerging in the ashes of this tired axis of dysfunctional liberalism that is said to be on one side of a “rift” forming within the “Unity Team”.",Politics
Inday’s Presidential Ambition is In-dead,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/indays-presidential-ambition-is-in-dead/,"Inday Sara Duterte has long been considered a formidable political figure with ambitions of becoming the country’s president. However, recent events and controversies have cast a dark shadow over her political career, indicating that her hope of winning the presidency is dead.
Below are the figurative nails in the coffin of her political ambition:
1. Betrayal of Running Mate:
One of the significant factors contributing to Duterte’s declining popularity is her alleged involvement in a plot to impeach and oust her running mate, President Bongbong Marcos. This revelation has shattered the trust of the Filipino people, who expected unity and cooperation from their leaders — especially when both leaders campaigned for unity. Such betrayal undermines her credibility and raises questions about her ability to lead effectively.
Moreover, betrayal is not something political players forgive and while the rift grossly evident, it is just a matter of time before the depth of the damage done becomes undeniable.
2. Implication in Extrajudicial Killings:
Another issue plaguing Duterte is her connection to the investigation on extrajudicial killings, which has caught the attention of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC’s summons and the threat of an arrest warrant have further tarnished her image. The allegations of involvement in such grave human rights violations are not easily dismissed, and they have eroded public trust in her ability to uphold the rule of law.
Furthermore, if indeed the ICC issues an arrest warrant against her, it will raise serious doubt in her ability to campaign effectively in 2028 as what had happened to Grace Poe when she ran for president in 2016 even after the Supreme Court had ruled on her status as natural Filipino.
3. Declining Popularity:
Recent surveys indicate a decline in Duterte’s popularity, only a year into her vice presidency. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the aforementioned controversies, a lack of concrete achievements, and a failure to address pressing issues faced by the Filipino people. Her inability to deliver on her promises has left many disillusioned, leading to a loss of support.
Unlike her father, Rodrigo Duterte who maintained an extraordinarily high approval rating throughout his six years in office, Inday’s ratings have sunk below fifty percent in Mindanao. Even other surveys showing a higher rating indicate a similar decline but with higher numbers.
4. Legacy of the Duterte Administration:
It is essential to consider the impact of Duterte’s familial ties to her father, President Rodrigo Duterte. While her father’s presidency was marked by a strongman image and controversial policies, the public sentiment towards his administration has shifted. The legacy of the Duterte administration, particularly with regard to human rights abuses and the war on drugs, may have a lasting negative impact on Duterte’s chances of winning the presidency.
5. Political Landscape and Competitors:
The political landscape in the Philippines is constantly evolving, and Duterte faces formidable competitors who have gained significant traction. Other potential candidates, such as Senator Raffy Tulfo, Senator Robin Padilla, former Vice President Leni Robredo, Senator Risa Hontiveros, and others evoke more excitement than a repeat of from the Duterte political franchise.
Duterte’s declining popularity coupled with strong opponents makes her path to the presidency even more challenging.
Inday Sara Duterte’s hope of winning the presidency appears to be fading rapidly. The betrayal of her running mate, implication in extrajudicial killings, declining popularity, the legacy of her father’s administration, and the competitive political landscape all contribute to this downfall. Rebuilding trust and addressing the serious allegations against her are monumental tasks that may prove insurmountable. As the political climate continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Duterte can revive her chances, but for now, her aspirations seem dead in the water.

Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for this beautiful nation and its people, which has fueled my desire to understand and contribute to its political landscape.

Inday Sara to Turn Philippines into North Korea,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/inday-sara-to-turn-philippines-into-north-korea/,"Although we see Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio’s power and influence waning, I am writing this as a thought experiment of sorts just to emphasize the dangers of electing a pro-totalitarian candidate as President.
It is important to note that the Philippines and North Korea are two distinct countries with different political systems, cultures, and socio-economic conditions. However, if we were to consider hypothetical scenarios where the Philippines would be more like North Korea, the following aspects might be considered:
1. Political System: North Korea is known for its totalitarian regime, where power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader and dissent is suppressed. If the Philippines were to adopt a similar political system, it would entail a highly centralized authority, limited political freedoms, and strict control over media and communication channels.
During her father’s term as president, we already saw how all those opposed to Rodrigo’s rule were marginalized and even cancelled. It had been the agenda of the Duterte administration to use the so-called “war” on illegal drugs and local armed communists to eat up the power base of the opposition with the objective of preventing them from being elected.
Now, with the Anti Terrorism Law (ATL) in place, it will now be possible to detain and freeze the assets of people declared as terrorists. Very recently, congressman Arnulfo Teves was tagged as a terrorist although he had figured as a suspect in the killing of his political rival Governor Roel Degamo.
Because of Inday Sara’s penchant to warp the application of laws, perhaps being schooled by her father in these ways, it is likely that she will silence dissent with the ATL.
2. Human Rights: North Korea has been widely criticized for its human rights abuses, including restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and movement. If the Philippines were to resemble North Korea in this aspect, it would involve curbing civil liberties, imposing strict censorship, and suppressing political opposition or dissenting voices.
We have to point out that Inday Sara is already being summoned by the International Criminal Court to answer to charges of committing human rights abuses alongside her father and two senators who served as his aides.
3. Economy: North Korea’s economy is largely isolated from the rest of the world due to international sanctions and limited trade. If the Philippines were to adopt a more closed economy like North Korea, it would mean reduced international trade, limited foreign investment, and heavy reliance on internal resources.
A situation wherein importation and exportation of good would be heavily restricted, the Duterte’s who’ve been rumored to control ports in Davao City would benefit immensely from “allowing” the entry and exit of what would later be very lucrative goods.
4. Media and Information Control: North Korea maintains tight control over media and information flow, with state-run media being the only authorized source of news. If the Philippines were to resemble North Korea in this regard, it would involve restricting independent journalism, censoring online content, and controlling public access to information.
Having destroyed ABS-CBN and caused the ejection of the Prietos from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, almost all other media outfits in the Philippines fear the same fate.
5. International Relations: North Korea has strained relationships with many countries due to its nuclear weapons program and provocative actions. If the Philippines were to be more like North Korea in terms of international relations, it would involve adopting a confrontational stance, isolating itself diplomatically, and pursuing aggressive policies that could lead to increased tensions with other nations.
Under her father’s presidency, the Philippine’s relations with the European Union and the US were strained. His pro-China stance also distanced the Philippines from Japan and other states friendly to the EU as well as the US.
It is important to reiterate that these scenarios are purely hypothetical, and the Philippines currently has a democratic system with a different set of values, principles, and aspirations — at least, for now.
Peace be upon you!

Duterte Quiboloy Cultists In Despair Over Inday Sara,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/duterte-quiboloy-cultists-in-despair-over-inday-sara/,"Followers of the politico-theological super cult created by former president Rodrigo Duterte and pastor Apollo Quiboloy are in despair over the waning political career of Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio.
Still addicted to the gravy train of power and money that flowed during the Duterte presidency, a huge number of them are worried over the coming end of their happy days as both their leaders are bound for either death, jail, or death in jail.
The International Criminal Court is undeterred from making Duterte answer to the charges of rampant human rights abuses and killings during his term as mayor of Davao City as well as the thousands of extra judicial killings perpetrated that he allegedly commanded.
On the other hand, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a wanted notice for pastor Apollo Quiboloy for “conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion, sex trafficking of children; sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion; conspiracy; bulk cash smuggling.”
The Duterte Quiboloy politico theological super cult has its roots not only in the psychopathological traits of both leaders, but also perhaps in a real friendship founded on commonalities and mutual benefit.
The friendship between Rodrigo Duterte and Apollo Quiboloy can be traced back to their early years in Davao City, Philippines. Duterte, known for his tough stance on crime and his successful tenure as mayor of Davao, first encountered Quiboloy when he sought spiritual guidance during a challenging time in his life. Quiboloy, a prominent religious leader with a large following, offered his support and counsel, sparking the beginning of a profound bond.
The friendship between Duterte and Quiboloy has had a significant impact on both the political and religious landscape of the Philippines. Quiboloy’s religious sect, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, has grown exponentially in recent years, attracting followers from all walks of life. This increased visibility has led to a greater influence for Quiboloy and his teachings, as well as increased scrutiny from skeptics.
In the political arena, Duterte’s association with Quiboloy has provided him with a strong support base, particularly in the southern region of Mindanao. Quiboloy’s endorsement has helped Duterte garner votes and maintain popularity among his followers. However, critics argue that this association blurs the line between religion and politics, potentially compromising the separation of church and state.
Followers of both Duterte and Quiboloy were hoping that Inday Sara would be able to thwart both the ICC and FBI from capturing their leaders.
However, the failure of Inday Sara’s ploy to wrest the presidency from Bongbong Marcos fatally damaged her political capital.
It was hoped that she would be able to support and field candidates for various local and national government positions in 2025 as a preparation for mounting a presidential campaign in 2028.
But all of that was scuttled when she revealed her treacherous hand all too early. The plan had been to first unseat House Speaker Martin Romualdez, after which she would install former president now congresswoman Gloria Arroyo, and then move to impeach then oust President Bongbong Marcos.
It was a foolish and brash ploy that backfired and burned up crucial alliances that would have enabled her to more effectively support the Duterte Quiboloy cult machinery and hold its reins onward to victory in 2025 then ultimately in 2028.
But, now, the Duterte Quiboloy politico-religious cult is staring down a rapidly emptying barrel as it is for certain that the horrendously huge funds given to the OVP, DepEd, and NTF-ELCAC is on its way to be throttled down via the DBM and then cut considerably by 2025.
Infact, we see Inday Sara being made to resign from her position as Education Secretary, while the NTF ELCAC — which is struggling to access its budget — will be disbanded. These two organizations house and support the operators of the Duterte Quiboloy politico religious cult.
The OVP satellite offices will be next on the chopping block as the Commission on Audit clamps down on more violations and the relevant oversight committee in the House of Representatives moves to re-align or outright cut its budget.
Without government money to sustain the Duterte Quiboloy cult and its leaders about to get arrested, it would be logical to speculate that Inday Sara would attempt to take over its leadership. This would enable her to still wield power based more on some form of fealty.
However, even that may be out of her reach. Even if Duterte and Quiboloy themselves, perhaps before their impending arrest, were able to anoint her as their successor.
Peace be upon you!

Bongbong Marcos has pulled the neoliberal narrative rug from under the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/bongbong-marcos-has-pulled-the-neoliberal-narrative-rug-from-under-the-philippine-opposition/,"Filipino neoliberals seem to be obsessed with the victim mindset. In his recent Inquirer column, Randy David describes Americans voting for former President Donald Trump as flirting with one-man rule because of the possibility that Trump might win again in 2024. “This,” David writes to punctuate his point, “is how dictatorships are born—often on the back of a popular vote.”
The former president is outpolling all his rivals, so much that even if the latter united behind one of them, their combined votes would not come close to denting Trump’s dominance. At the national level, Joe Biden’s approval ratings have been abysmal. Between him and Trump, the votes are evenly split, signifying a deep politico-cultural divide within the American polity itself.
American media has long hidden the truth about the divide between north and south, which was the cause of the civil war and the fact that, up to today, racial discrimination still exists in American society. Then there’s the military-industrial complex which has been tagged as being behind the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. For years, we were led to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman despite the Zapruder footage showing Kennedy was successively shot twice; the first hitting him at the throat and the second, at the back of his head. No trained marksman can get off two shots that quick with the target on a moving vehicle.
It was easy to brainwash people then into believing America stood for good while the rest of the despots in the world were evil. There is conclusive proof that most of the wars, after the last two great wars, were American-instigated. This is substantiation that America’s divisive wounds never completely healed after the civil war. Conservative Americans constitute the bulk of its military. Recruitment sources the warm bodies from the youth of the Midwest and the South, the two regions far removed from the glamour and sophistication of the major cities on the West and East Coast.
The 2020 election was tumultuous to say the least. America is financing another war right after it pulled out of Afghanistan. It suffered the fate of other hegemons which tried to subjugate the Afghans. Miserable failure. The last American military victory was its defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Its latest incursion in the Middle East since 2001 ended in defeat. The world isn’t a better place with American hegemony as it continues to pressure Russia and China to bend to its will.
What’s funny about national democratic Filipinos like David is their penchant for siding with hegemons in the defense of democracy. Trump isn’t a communist but is branded as a potential dictator. How for god’s sake? What David and the rest of the neoliberals across the world are afraid of is the rise of conservatism and rightist tendencies in Europe and other countries. David has nothing to fear in the Philippines because Marcos is adhering to the dictum of the “rights based international order.” They won’t get what they exactly want but their American and European principals will have to live with it because they need a lackey in the region and that is us with the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).
The opposition’s conundrum is President Bongbong Marcos has co-opted their agenda which leaves them scratching their heads because he has adopted their cause as his own. Subliminally maybe this is what David is referring to. Look at the leftist-militants being virulently anti-China but also being anti-Marcos. It doesn’t compute given the current alliances. I don’t think the opposition can get its head out of its ass for the 2025 and 2028 election. Maybe it’s only a matter of time before they go extinct.",Politics
What Will Happen If VP Sara Duterte Succeeds President Bongbong Marcos?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/what-will-happen-if-vp-sara-duterte-succeeds-president-bongbong-marcos/,"A week or two ago, I was watching Stephen CuUnjieng talking about why foreign investments continue to shy away from the Philippines. Among the many things he said, one that stood out was the country’s apparent lack of long term planning and a consistent following through on that plan.
In the Philippines, every newly elected President represents a divergence from the policies, programs, and plans made by the President he or she succeeded. The divergence itself may vary, both in magnitude and in area, but the result is always the same and that is a shift in the country’s focus as well as direction.
In former President Rodrigo Duterte’s presidency, the bigger emphasis was on “winning” the war on drugs.
This so-called war failed. As far as anyone with an internet connection and Google can find out, the illegal drug trade continues in this country and it doesn’t look like it will end anytime soon — if that is even possible. The only noteworthy results of this grand fiasco was that it, in the course of pursuing this “war”, Duterte succeeded in racking up charges of massive human rights abuses and alienating the international community — save, except for the Russia, People’s Republic of China, Mongolia, North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
Perhaps a saving grace of Duterte’s presidency is the emphasis (although much lesser) given to infrastructure building or the so-called “Build Build Build” program and this has become one of the central programs of President Bongbong Marcos’s administration.
The continuation of Build Build Build (renamed Build Better More) as well as more focus on agriculture, the revival of mining operations, tourism, and other bright spots for investment, Marcos is also on the right track in reconnecting the Philippines to the proverbial river of global investment.
If Marcos manages to make good on plans of getting the economy back on its feet (and I figure it will take most of his administration to barely get us there), we may see the emergence of a stronger, more numerous Filipino middle class because he is putting in more of the country’s money behind prosperity programs instead of anti-poverty programs which just bread more poverty.
It would be an absolute dung-kicker move if our voters elect another Duterte hoping for a repeat of Rodrigo’s misguided all-balls/all-mouth no-brain leadership.
So far, as we have seen in the past year, Vice President Sara’s leadership has amounted to dole outs galore through the satellite offices of her office and a failure to deliver any meaningful improvement on public education — which she directly handles as Education secretary. It would be great if she could claim to have actually been integral to the defeat of the so-called terrorist communists a. k. a. New People’s Army, but she’s just the chief blabber mouth of NTF ELCAC.
Based on her moves so far, if she does succeed Marcos as President, we can look forward to enabling mendicancy as the cherry on top of a plethora of populist programs that have no hope of changing what needs to be changed: Da Pobresito Pinoy.
As they say, “Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.” In this series of turns from strong men to weak men, I do hope that Marcos is the strong man that creates good times and perhaps someone like House Speaker Martin Romualdez is the “just as strong” man that leads us to better times.
Peace be upon you!

"With Duterte gone, Philippine politics is back to normal",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/with-duterte-gone-philippine-politics-is-back-to-normal/,"Now that former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is on a jet bound for The Hague to face the “International Criminal Court” (ICC), the political “debate” is back in traditional form — the old battle between the Marcoses and the Martial Law Crybabies. The partisan camp that dominates the latter are honchos and “activists” of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis who, we recall, hijacked the street “revolution” that resulted in the ouster of former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986. With the son — current President Bongbong Marcos — in power today, “thought leaders” of the Martial Law Crybabies will very likely be turning their sights back on their traditional nemesis.
It may be Game Over for the Dutertes but not for the Yellowtards and commies. Unlike the Dutertards who count just a rabble of “influencers” amongst their activist ranks, the Martial Law Crybabies boast an experienced and formidable political and influence machine. Pillars of this machine are the Yellowtards’ hold over the Philippine oligarchy, their intimate (often literally) relationship with honchos of the Roman Catholic Church, the mainstream media industry (including their Western cronies), and faculty and student leaders of the country’s educational institutions most of which are infiltrated by commie elements.
Indeed, a key rallying cry of the Martial Law Crybabies is “Never forget”. While the bloc suffered a catastrophic failure to honour their vow that there would never again be a Marcos in power, they, at least, will never forget the “Martial Law Era” over which Bongbong’s father presided. High time has come for the Yellowtards, in particular, to pick up from where they left off.
The commies, for their part, will recall that they are against any legitimately-elected Philippine government (past, present, and future) and any form of “imperialist” influence applied to the Philippines. Their template “activist” slogan, after all, is the all-time classic “Tutulan ang imperyalistang U.S.-[insert name of president here] rehime” (translated in English “Oppose the imperialist US-___ regime!”).
Indeed, make no mistake, commies have only one singular goal — wage an armed “people’s revolution” to topple the “reactionary” regime and install a “dictatorship of the proletariat”. While the ideology of the Yellowtards may not be as monomanic as their commie chums, make no mistake too. The Yellowtards will resort to any means to acquire power under the veneer of “the people’s will”. It was, after all, the Yellowtards who roped in the ICC to their “cause”. Lest we forget.",Politics
Necropolitics is the strategy of last resort for the Duterte camp,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/necropolitics-is-the-strategy-of-last-resort-for-the-duterte-camp/,"The popularity argument is being worn thin by the Duterte camp. It is devilishly difficult to gauge public sentiment more so considering there is a multitude of competing “survey” firms that claim to be “scientific” and “unbiased” in their methods of getting a reading on public opinion.
It seems political and “thought” leaders as well as pedestrian observers have not learnt much from the sketchy reliability of displays of popularity in the past. The catastrophic defeat of Leni Robredo in the 2022 elections is one case in point. Displays of solidarity in massive rallies backed by the chi chi clique of the private school set and their Catholic schools together with the amplification services of mainstream media all failed to deliver her that “important” presidency. Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency of the United States is the most recent example of a similarly incompetent appraisal of public sentiment by inbred liberal thinking.
Perhaps then it is worth considering that supporters of embattled former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte could be barking up the wrong tree. Images of sporadic mass protests in his support bubbling up in the Philippines and abroad being shared across social media may lead one to believe that there could be a pathway to Duterte’s getting out of the bind he is in. However, this all seems akin to the same situation in the South China Sea where Filipinos too had dropped the ball. Once you’ve been tricked into ceding territory to the enemy, it is very difficult to get it back. The government of current President Bongbong Marcos was very clinical in its (practically literal) execution throwing out a pain-in-the-ass political rival over the fence and into the hands of a foreign “court” hungry for validation.
Duterte may not come back alive but his coming back dead could be that silver lining his “die-hard” (DDS) supporters are scrounging around for. One must not discount the power of necropolitics. This is, after all, a country with a state religion that uses a dead man hanging off a cross as its rallying icon.
We have, after all, no less than almost half a century of contemporary Philippine history to look back to for lessons — from the time the bloodied body of the late former senator Ninoy Aquino was paraded through Manila’s streets for political gain, the rise of the Second Aquino presidency on the back of Cory nostalgia, to the body of the late “dictator” kept in cryo over the course of his journey to a hero’s burial. That’s not to mention the National Hero himself Jose Rizal who was written into Philippine history books on the back of his “martyrdom” in the hands of Filipinos’ then colonial masters.
At this stage, now that his camp have all but dropped the ball, former President Rodrigo Duterte is more valuable dead. While alive, his political capital and that of his camp will progressively be eroded as the trial in The Hague drags on and more of the details of his alleged “genocide” is used as fodder by the Yellowtard-Communist Axis and their European chums.",Politics
Astounding double standard: Mainstream media mum over government intimidation of political bloggers,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/astounding-double-standard-mainstream-media-mum-over-government-intimidation-of-political-bloggers/,"Chalk another one up for the double standard of the Philippines’ mainstream media. On one hand, they would be up in arms over even the slightest hint of government and powerful politicians’ influence — much more suppression — of citizens’ rights to express themselves in a public forum. On the other, and in today’s case, they’d let slide an obvious concerted effort to suppress a strong collective voice.
At the core of this “debate” over freedom of expression is the assertion by politicians that certain bloggers and content creators are exploiting their large social media followings to disseminate information of questionable quality. Then again, if one would stop to step back from the tech media available today and look at the first principles here, how different is blogging and social media posting from the act of stepping onto a soapbox in a public square and shouting out one’s views?
To be fair, many digital content publishers apply malicious intent in the delivery of their craft. Some have, rightly so, been called out for the outright falsehoods they liberally pepper their work with. Then again, “journalists” employed by traditional media organisations would also be hard-pressed to disprove a lack of balance or malicious bias in their work. Indeed, look no further than the suspicious circumstances surrounding the founding of “social news media” organisation Rappler in 2012 — impeccably timed to coincide with the impeachment circus against the late Chief Justice (at the time) Renato Corona that was about to erupt. Rappler then joined other mainstream media organisations in an all-out demonisation campaign against Corona, publishing and amplifying outrageous and unverified information about him.
Worse things were perpetrated by this mob back then. Rappler “online reporter” Magtanggol de la Cruz published the balance of one of Corona’s foreign currency deposits in an article that bears the ironic title ‘Secrecy in foreign currency deposits‘ dated the 8th of Feb…
The latest one that has grabbed my attention has to do with whether or not a Philippine bank can be compelled via a subpoena to disclose information relating to a foreign currency bank deposit of its depositor, in this case, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The scuttlebutt, of course, is that Justice Corona has a US$[bleep] deposit held by the Philippine Savings Bank (PSBank) and that the prosecutors even know its account number.
…refering to a previous article dated the 4th of Feb where “online reporter” Carmela Fonbuena reveals not only that dollar amount but the account number where it is deposited as well…
The $[bleep] deposited in account number [bleep] is supposedly just one of 14 accounts that the Chief Justice and his wife Cristina individually and jointly own with daughter Carla Castillo and her husband Constantino III. Prosecution wants the branch manager of PSBank Katipunan branch to appear before the court and bring the bank documents on February 7, Tuesday.
All the above were potential criminal acts that reflected badly on the integrity of the then Senate impeachment trial court which, it can be argued, became party to violations of bank secrecy laws when it allowed admission of evidence obtained by unlawful means.
The short of it is that really bad things were done by supposedly credentialled “journalists” working for “reputable” corporate institutions such as Rappler. Why then is Congress today giving the time of day spending precious taxpayer funds turning the screws on small fry such as these personalities within the so-called “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) blogger community? Perhaps these content creators are, in fact, perceived to be a significant threat to today’s powers-that-be — a government and political camp that had, in fairness to them, handily outwitted their vastly more popular nemesis camp.
The camp of former President Rodrigo Duterte, unfortunately, have not much left other than an ability to stir up public discontent via the messaging of its cadre of political bloggers. In light of this, perhaps it would be sensible for the DDS community to carefully consider the quality and soundness of their methodology seeing that a desperate foe becomes more dangerous as their desperation escalates.",Politics
Philippines hopelessly divided under a government that stood for “UNITY”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/philippines-hopelessly-divided-under-a-government-that-stood-for-unity/,"In his recent Inquirer column, Randy David shares his views on the aftermath of the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. He cites the inutile state of the Philippines’ judicial system which “failed to hold Duterte accountable for the thousands of killings during his brutal drug war.”
[Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla’s] acknowledgement of the ICC as a “court of last resort” for the families of victims of the drug war is a quiet but radical shift. He recognized that our institutions indeed failed, and clearly had no intention, to deliver justice on their own.
While the focus of David’s lament is on the alleged “extra-judicial killings” (EJKs) supposedly perpetrated during Duterte’s drug war, what of the victims of the drug addicts and pushers who also don’t have the resources for extended court proceedings? And that is for cases where the perpetrators are caught by the police, which is another challenge in itself.
A Filipino who faces this conundrum has to prioritize earning a living for his family and not having to pay a lawyer or rely on the unreliable and usually under-experienced and overworked Public Attorney’s Office (PAO lawyer. The victim or the victim’s family, usually doesn’t have the means to take time off from work to attend to the case. The difficulty of the experience often leads to the plaintiffs just giving up and the accused never being prosecuted unless it’s a state case.
There is also the issue of how we obtain evidence and prosecute presidents who run afoul of the law. In the case of former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada, the demolition job on him began when he emerged as the top candidate in 1998 and never stopped until he was ousted in 2001.
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was packaged as the savior by the Yellowidiots until she disagreed with how the Hacienda Luisita case was to be handled. There was also the issue of how she was just supposed to serve the unexpired term of Estrada and not run for re-election. But she decided not to honor the agreement and she faced numerous attempts to oust her during her extended administration. She wasn’t successful in getting her nominated successor appointed and she spent the next five years of the administration of her successor, the late former President Noynoy Aquino, in detention.
Do you see the pattern? Philippine presidents need to get an anointed successor elected to ensure they suffer no revenge-prosecution after the protection of immunity lapses. In Duterte’s case, the Yellowidiots already ran to the International Criminal Court (ICC) even before his term was over. Some Filipinos turn a blind eye to the legitimate issue of sovereignty just because it doesn’t align with their goal of seeing a hated president in detention.
The stability of the government also comes into play. Erap was convicted by the Sandiganbayan but had to be pardoned by GMA to ensure she finished her term.
The incontrovertible truth about the fate of Duterte is he was renditioned to the ICC because he posed a threat to the administration. It remains to be seen what his fate will be under a foreign court whose credibility isn’t beyond question. What’s certain is it has again divided the country in the midst of the midterm election cycle which still has to contend with the impeachment trial of the vice-president who happens to be Duterte’s daughter.
Perhaps this is why why the influential Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) has taken a public stand last Friday. The INC has always maintained neutrality in politics during the most tumultuous periods in the country’s history. It did order its members out in the streets when it perceived that the Aquino administration was going after it during an internal leadership issue. But it didn’t make any formal statement about the administration’s actions.
We face a myriad of problems which we can solve if only our leaders aren’t so busy protecting the status quo which benefits those who rule the country in politics and business. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what’s wrong with the system. It’s evident. It’s staring at us in our collective faces.
The only hope we have left is in ourselves if we turn to collective action. Otherwise, if we don’t take action then we should accept the consequence of inaction which is counting to see our country go down the path to nowhere.",Politics
President Marcos’s schmooze with EC president Ursula von der Leyen does not necessarily doom Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/president-marcoss-schmooze-with-ec-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-does-not-necessarily-doom-duterte/,"Antonio Montalvan in his piece “The visit of Ursula von der Leyen to Manila” published on Press One writes about of the “first ever” visit to the Philippines by a sitting president of the European Commission in July 31. This followed through on an invitation extended to Ursula von der Leyen by President Bongbong Marcos during his visit to Brussels in December last year.
Montalvan makes sure to note the absence of Vice President Sara Duterte speculatively highlighting that “her father was the cause of the collapse of EU-Philippines relations.” At some point after he enumerates the “carrot” offered by the EU to the Philippines, Montalvan drops the key payload of his blurb…
“Economic progress can only be coupled with social progress in our societies.” And that is where the negotiations for the GSP+ will be hinged upon. The EU has repeatedly demanded the release of Leila de Lima and Philippine accountability in the drug-related killings. In February, a group of EU lawmakers said that Manila’s chances of GSP+ renewal depended on whether the country rejoined the International Criminal Court.
Not surprising, of course. All is predicated on accepting the dictates of the European Union. So there’s now the pivot to the US and Europe. Will Marcos deliver former President Rodrigo Duterte on a silver platter too? Of course not. But he is willing to talk. The EU non government organisations (NGOs) continue to provide financial support to their “socialist” — nee, leftist-militant — allies in the country. These are what is left of the National Democratic Front (NDF) in the mainstream. The Dutch leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army along with its “legal front” (CPP/NPA/NDF) is all literally dead. Von Der Leyen is also the EUs point person for Ukraine. Is the stage being set for the Philippines to be the pawn against China in Southeast Asia?
The Opposition is hoping that “justice” can be served to Duterte and his cohorts. But given the incestuous nature of Philippine politics, that won’t happen. Marcos is playing a game where he gives the EU a carrot. The EU is playing the same game. Unfortunately, this won’t end well. It’s a question of maximum utility; who has best use for whom? There’s the likelihood that both sides will end up with the stick though.
Marcos will have more pressing problems before the end of year. Inflation is still high. The economy isn’t growing at the expected pace. Oil prices are going up. The peso is depreciating. I hate to say it but Diokno and Balisacan aren’t cutting it. Both don’t have actual business experience unlike former Secretary Sonny Dominguez. We’re not going to have the same Christmas as last year as the consumption-driven economy may drastically slow down for the greater majority of Filipinos who aren’t rich.",Politics
Sara Duterte had long been a liability and the Duterte camp failed to realise it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/sara-duterte-had-long-been-a-liability-and-the-duterte-camp-failed-to-realise-it/,"Of all the points being missed by the partisan camp surrounding the clan of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, one is the most critical of all — Vice President Sara Duterte is not her father. It is important that supporters of the Duterte clan understand this. It is the same misunderstanding that sunk the Yellowtards when they assumed that the ascent to power of the late former President Noynoy Aquino — son of the “national hero” — would strengthen the Yellowtard dynasty.
There is compelling reason for the Duterte camp to seriously consider a confronting idea — that behind the fall of Duterte is his daughter, the current vice president. Sara, after all, got into bed with then presidential candidate (now President) Bongbong Marcos against her father’s wishes to form the “Unity Team” in the lead up to the 2022 national elections. A mistake, perhaps, but that’s just our hindsight being a smartass as usual. Once in office, the Vice President proceeded to behave like a spoilt brat then threw a monumental tantrum when given a much deserved spanking. To the excuse that she was being conspired against by the Marcos-Romualdez family, well, better statesmen would have handled all that more shrewdly.
In short, Sara Duterte wasn’t a skillful enough statesman to deftly navigate the shark infested waters of Imperial Manila’s corridors of power. Poor breeding and poor gamesmanship plus the incompetent handlers who held court around her pretty much did her in. Unfortunately for her father, Sara was the only thing standing between the Marcoses and their new-found allies in the Yellowtard-Communist Axis and the endurance of her family’s legacy. The short of it is that Sara Duterte dropped the ball.
So here we are today. Regrets and hindsight are of little use in a world where the only thing that really matters is what happens next. Even what is right or wrong counts for jack shit when regarded from the perspective that politics is a game where those who play it well win. The fact is, the Marcoses played well, and the Dutertes and their camp — perhaps numerous as they claim — didn’t play at all, focusing instead on whining about being “the best” (remember that strategy?).
“Your best! Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f–k the prom queen.”
The Second Marcos Regime played well and all but checkmated the Dutertards on the Philippines’ chequered political board. The latter player was just too busy gushing over and propping up a quaint scion who was but a pale shadow of a great statesman. Whatever way the Marcos Administration pulled off the shipping off of former President Duterte to the International Criminal Court — whether it was “illegal”, politically motivated, or dishonest — no longer matters.
The important lesson here is that family ties could often turn to liabilities. Sara was clearly a liability to the Duterte clan and to its support base the members of which were too starry-eyed by her celebrity to take stock of the facts surrounding their evolving situation — poor chess players in a game where the Queen may often have to fall to protect the King and win.",Politics
Duterte Lackeys Baiting House Speaker into a Fight with ACT Rep. France Castro?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/duterte-lackeys-baiting-house-speaker-into-a-fight-with-act-rep-france-castro/,"In a show on SMNI, a media company owned by Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, we saw one of the hosts named Ka Eric calling on House Speaker Martin Romualdez to investigate France Castro. He made the call on the basis of his bare allegations that Castro has been misusing funds from public as well as other sources to support communist terrorists.
It would be fair to assume that he is raising this call merely because it is within the House Speaker’s duties to ensure that all congressmen abide by the laws of the land as well as the rules of the House of Representatives.
However, that assumption would seem naive if we were to take the following into consideration:
So, if Romualdez loses his senses and investigates Castro on the basis of Ka Eric’s allegations, then he would provide the so-called “disgruntled congressmen” something to goad him into giving them what they want or else they’ll castigate him for not being in-line with the government’s fight against terrorists.
This ploy is eerily similar to all the ploys launched by Duterte-ists when they’re bullying their way to some action their political cult god wants. It is premised on a false dichotomy, “if you are not for A, then you are for B” which has played out in such instances as when LGUs were told to “post tarps declaring the NPA as persona non grata, otherwise be branded as terrorist sympathizers”.
It would be in his best interest as well as Duterte’s interest to somehow through his own and SMNI’s media/social media clout to tip over the supposedly “rickety” hold that Romualdez has over the Speakership.
Similar to the ploy of congressmen, Quiboloy might be eyeing either some agreement with Speaker Romualdez to shelter him from the FBI (if at all possible, which I doubt) or reboot the scheme to topple Romualdez in order to install former president now congresswoman Gloria Arroyo as Speaker.  Once installed, the next step would be to get an impeachment complaint underway and then use the process to oust President Bongbong Marcos. If it all works out, Vice President Inday would take over the presidency and could thwart the arrest of Quiboloy by the FBI as well as the arrest of her own father by the International Criminal Court.
Even barring the factors cited, it would still be inappropriate for House Speaker Romualdez to order the investigation of Castro unless the appropriate law enforcement agencies take action first. First to verify the accusations made by Ka Eric and second, to file the appropriate charges with the National Prosecutorial Service.
As far as appropriate agencies are concerned, the work of actually rallying law enforcement to investigate Ka Eric’s allegations against ACT Congresswoman Castro is the NTF ELCAC — which, by the way, is co-headed by none other than Vice President Sara.

The Duterte camp needs a new leader. Finding one is what they need to focus on!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/the-duterte-camp-needs-a-new-leader-finding-one-is-what-they-need-to-focus-on/,"All their eggs in one basket. That’s the situation the camp of former President Rodrigo Duterte find themselves in today. They may be numerous (if we rely on the size of their mass protest rallies), perhaps. But the million-dollar question is, how do they turn those numbers into power?
First thing to reflect upon is how members of the camp — and their leaders — identify themselves. This is most evident in the name or label which both Duterte supporters and their detractors alike refer to the camp; i.e., the “Die-hard Duterte Supporters” (DDS). In short, the Duterte camp identify as, well, the Duterte people — not an ideological or principles-based movement but as a personality-based bloc. The trouble with that is, amongst the Duterte family, there really is — or, rather, was — only two viable candidates for some sort of political leadership role: (1) the former president himself and (2) his daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte.
It seems, this is what puts the Duterte camp in a bind. They lack a bases (such as a clear idea of what they collectively stand for) to extend their scale beyond (and independent of) the Duterte clan. And, more obviously, now that the elder Duterte had all but been checkmated by the government of current President Bongbong Marcos, the DDS are left with only one option for leadership within the tiny frame they define themselves — the VP. Again, another important question: is Vice President Sara Duterte an asset to their cause? The answer to that question was something I explored in my previous article.
Never mind then all the historical context that led the DDS to this situation today that they continue to harp on. The past is set in stone and the future is what one can control. As such, the more productive focus should be on what to do next given these circumstances.
First thing’s first, elections need to be won. Who will lead the DDS to that electoral victory? Vice President Sara? Perhaps. Who else? Left scratching your head by that last question? That’s what we meant by having all the eggs in one basket.
Do the Dutertes hold a monopoly on delivering what the DDS want to see the Philippines achieve over the next ten years? For that matter what sort of country do the DDS aspire to build over that horizon? Do they even think that far ahead?
If the extent of their imagination cannot go beyond the frame defined by their loyalty to the Duterte clan, then the confronting reality is that the DDS are nothing more than a cult of personality — a community that faces utter collapse without a personality to look up to and to define their lot.
This is the fact the DDS need to confront if they aspire to evolve into a mature political force. The alternative is to face the inevitable descent to oblivion. They need to learn the lessons offered by the catastrophic defeat of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis in 2022 brought about by their inability to find a strong leader to lead them through that “important” election.",Politics
@MWinnieMonsod Should Thank Duterte Et Al for Neutering the Philippine Press,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/mwinniemonsod-should-thank-duterte-for-neutering-the-philippine-press/,"We see through @MWinnieMonsod’s attempt to hype up a so-called court case in the US where House Speaker Martin Romualdez was reportedly implicated by the complainant in a business deal gone awry. The aging dilawan journo feigns shock, “Why hasn’t Philippine media blasted this out of proportion?! Que horror!”
But, how could the Philippine news media do so at a time when free expression has been sent into deep freeze because… well… the Duterte administration’s successful attacks on news media organizations such as the Philippine Daily Inquirer and ABS-CBN. This is not to mention the countless other instances where journalists were sued for cyber-libel or killed for reporting on crime/corruption perpetrated by Duterte’s allies.
Oh, Philippines, the land of beautiful beaches, delicious food, and of course, never-ending political drama!
Just when you thought things couldn’t get any more interesting, we now have House Speaker Romualdez making headlines in a US court case. And we wish it could be because of his FAMAS award or that he’s being accused of stealing the last slice of lechon during a political banquet.
Now, before we dive into this juicy story, let’s take a moment to appreciate the irony of it all.
We have our dear Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, daughter of the infamous President Rodrigo Duterte, facing human rights cases — murder of thousands — before the International Criminal Court. And now, we have Speaker Romualdez, allegedly involved in a court case over the ownership of the Okada Casino Resort.
Oh, the plot thickens! Is this another of the Duterte camp’s attempts to drag down Romualdez to their level?
A tit for tat, where the tit would be “Inday Sara’s ICC arrest warrant” and the tat would be a summons for Romualdez to appear before a case involving private companies? But that isn’t exactly mirroring the gravity of offenses Duterte the father and Duterte the daughter is accused of.
Let’s break it down, shall we?
In the Okada case, filed in a Delaware court, which by the way, sounds like a place straight out of a mafia movie, Romualdez is being implicated by the party suing Okada’s parent company Universal.
Now, I don’t know about you, but when I think of a court case in Delaware, I imagine shady characters in trench coats and fedoras, exchanging briefcases full of cash. It’s like a Filipino telenovela crossed with The Sopranos.
On the other hand, we have the ICC case against Vice President Inday Sara Duterte. This case involves allegations of human rights abuses  — murder of thousands — committed by the police under her father’s command during his controversial anti-illegal drugs campaign.
It’s a serious matter, no doubt, but the Delaware case lacks the gut-wrenching cries of thousands of civilians supposedly executed on the command of former president Duterte.
Now, let’s address the elephant in the room – the media coverage, or lack thereof.
Our beloved Winnie Monsod, or @MWinnieMonsod for those of you who are social media-savvy, is decrying the lack of attention given to Romualdez’s alleged involvement in the Okada case. And I must say, she has a point.
We, the Filipino people, deserve to know what our politicians are up to, especially when it involves casinos and courtrooms.
But hey, can we really blame all these news media organizations for wanting to just exist? After all, the biggest and baddest of these truth seekers were decimated by the Dutertes.
And now, most of them have been reduced to covering the latest showbiz scandal or the newest love team than diving into the intricacies of a court case. I mean, who needs hard-hitting investigative journalism that imperils the very existence of the company and the journalist writing the story, when you can have a front-page spread on the latest celebrity breakup that sells ads in the millions of gajillions of pesos?
In conclusion, my dear readers, the Philippine political landscape is a never-ending source of entertainment. From court cases in Delaware to human rights allegations in The Hague, it’s like a never-ending episode of a reality TV show. So, sit back, grab a bag of chicharon, and enjoy the show. And remember, when it comes to Philippine politics, truth is often stranger than fiction.

Philippine elections 2025: Idiots equipped with smartphones with minds altered by social media are a menace!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/philippine-elections-2025-idiots-equipped-with-smartphones-with-minds-altered-by-social-media-are-a-menace/,"Too much social media? This is, of course, a global problem leading some countries like Australia to apply minimum age limits to the creation of accounts on popular social media services. This particular age limits “solution”, interestingly enough, highlights the core issue of how access to unregulated information poses a potential hazard to impressionable young minds.
Bad news then for the Philippines when one considers that this is a country renowned for its people’s stunted comprehension faculties. According to a recent report, inauthentic agents and communities on the Net have “shaped the conversation” surrounding this year’s mid-term elections there.
[…] up to 45% of discussions about the elections – a showdown between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and the Duterte camp – have been driven by inauthentic accounts, including sock puppets, avatars and bots.
“What we found in the Philippines isn’t just disinformation spike – it’s digital warfare,” said Cyabra’s chief executive, Dan Brahmy.
Step back and take the time to put two and two together. Potent mind-altering substances such as alcohol and narcotics have long been regulated and, in the case of the latter, prohibited. Severe penalties are applied to people who use them when operating dangerous machinery (which includes common road vehicles).
The key words here are mind-altering. It describes the key impact of these substances that make them dangerous. Upon this principle, one can then make a strong argument posed by unfettered access to that quintessentially 21st Century mind-altering drug — social media. People under the influence of this substance shouldn’t be allowed to operate dangerous machinery — such as mobile phones which are known to be the primary hardware used to spread disinformation. Like drunk drivers and deranged, ill-trained public bus and jeepney drivers, morons equipped with smartphones are a menace to society.
Think then of just how vulnerable the Philippines is to mind-altering technologies. It is a nation of lazy thinkers. It’s a huge ask of Filipinos to think things through before reacting or forming opinion about a piece of information they would come across over a given day. As a result, public discourse in the Philippines is characterised by a lack of new ideas or a failure to engage with new information. It is easy to observe that this has led to stagnation or decline in the nation’s collective intellectual abilities. Laziness and impoverished minds impede an entire people’s capacity to think critically and engage with the world in a meaningful way.
Indeed, as we observed in a previous article, 50% of Filipinos stunted at childhood in the 1980s could be why the Philippines is so intellectually-bankrupt today!
[Inquirer columnist Cielito Habito] cites the incidence of stunting in Filipino children — that “[the] World Bank sees us as having the fifth highest stunting prevalence in the East Asia and Pacific region, and among the top 10 countries worldwide with the most number of stunted children.” Physical stunting (which is the subject of the WB report) in children likely has a strong impact on brain development. This is the bomb Habito drops on his readers…
One can better appreciate how critical this all is knowing that a child’s first five years is the most critical period in shaping his/her life-long outcomes. There’s a simple reason for this: 90 percent of human brain development occurs by age 5. Development institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme thus see strategic interventions in those early years as the most efficient and effective means to address persistent social and economic inequities. A child stunted at age 5 only has the remaining 10 percent of brain development left, hence is damaged for life with lifelong effects on her/his physical, cognitive, linguistic, and socio-emotional abilities.
Tinapay na nga naging bato pa.
Suddenly it all makes sense. Wonder no more why Filipinos seem to suffer a clearly-evident collective intellectual bankruptcy today.
Therein lies the irony that flies way above Filipinos’ pointed heads. While many harp about the proliferation of “dangerous drugs” against which former President Rodrigo Duterte supposedly waged his “war” and for which he now languishes in The Hague before an “international criminal court”, few realise the technological drug that now addles the minds of an entire generation of young Filipino voters.",Politics
Why is Philippine politics so full of drama?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/why-is-philippine-politics-so-full-of-drama/,"If the Philippines got a penny whenever wonder over its dysfunctional politics is raised, it’d be a First World country by now. Indeed, emotionalism reins supreme in the National “Debate” there. Facts and critical thinking routinely take a back seat to shrill hysterics exchanged amongst its foremost “thought leaders”. Social media had exacerbated this predisposition to unproductive mudslinging and the landscape is increasingly hopelessly paralysed.
The most evident manifestation of this dysfunction is the continued coalescing into cults of personality among the country’s chattering classes. Having been utterly crushed in the 2022 national elections, the Yellowtard-Communist Axis — regarded widely as the bloc of left-of-centre “liberals” — are a scattered, hopelessly-fragmented and ineffective force. For its part, having taken hold of the nation, the arguably right-wing “Unity Team” of winning tandem of Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte — now President and Vice President respectively — are now seeing their support base polarised into the Marcos “BBM” and Duterte “DDS” camps.
The common denominator here, aside from the traditional stupidity of the “debate” surrounding these “developments” is continued beholdenness to personalities. Issues are not unpacked in this “debate” through the application of systematic thinking. They are regarded from the lens of the perceived personal loyalties of the actors and agents contributing to it. It is easy to see why no conversation moves forward. The intellectual bankruptcy of the landscape turned what is supposed to be a free market of ideas into a deadly minefield where most great ideas get blown up trying the navigate it.
One has to be baduy to make a mark as an “influential” in today’s political chatter. But even in cultivating a baduy persona, one needs to be consistent. Failed presidential candidate Leni Robredo learnt this the hard way when she made a misguided foray into baduy theatrics during her ill-fated campaign. She is supported by a community made up of Manila’s chi chi private school elite to which she makes a woke social justice appeal. As such, her pedestrian antics come across as absolute cringe.
One can easily argue that all this merely mirrors society today in the age of social media and the shortening of attention spans this state of things has induced. However, all things being equal, Filipino minds have proven to be particularly predisposed to being easily-swayed by theatrics. Even before social media became a thing, Philippine politics was already known for its showbiz character and lowest-common-denominator “debate”. Even before the Internet became a ubiquitous household technology, Filipinos were already voting uneducated celebrities to office and gushing over unqualified scions of manufactured “national heroes”.
To be fair, all this makes Philippine politics fertile ground for the sorts of “influencers” we see today — baduy and malaswa and all mukhang pera. There are no principles at stake, only personal brands and access to power. This is pure capitalism in an industrially-bankrupt economy — except that no assets are created and brand equity is fleeting as evident in the way once-prominent personalities flame out under the weight of their individual dependencies on patrons and lack of a foundation of stable principles. Add to that an inability to innovate in their approach to messaging and we get what is all clearly evident today — an intellectually bankrupt society.",Politics
"China to Reward Digong, Inday Sara, and Quiboloy with Asylum?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/china-to-reward-digong-inday-sara-and-quiboloy-asylum/,"Former president Rodrigo Duterte’s recent private visit to China has left the public scratching their heads and conspiracy theories running wild. With the visit happening just weeks before a tense incident involving Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels, it’s no wonder eyebrows were raised.
But that’s not all – the presence of Duterte’s cult leader, Apollo Quiboloy, and the criminal allegations surrounding both men have added a spicy twist to this already bizarre tale.
Let us delve into the depths of this comedy of errors and ponder the possibility of secret deals and asylum-seeking shenanigans.
Described as a “surprise” visit by the South China Morning Post, Duterte’s trip to China couldn’t have come at a more precarious time. As tensions between China and the Philippines were escalating due to territorial disputes, the visit raised suspicions and fueled speculation. Prodded by this unexpected rendezvous, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. felt compelled to publicly acknowledge the visit, further adding to the intrigue surrounding the trip.
To make matters even more perplexing, it was revealed that Apollo Quiboloy, Duterte’s self-proclaimed cult leader, accompanied him on this enigmatic journey. Quiboloy claims that he went to China to strike a deal with a Chinese media company, but his presence raises questions about ulterior motives.
Both Duterte and Quiboloy are no strangers to controversy, with criminal allegations looming over their heads. Could they be seeking asylum in exchange for valuable state secrets? The plot thickens!
In the face of China’s encroachment on Philippine territory and the harassment of Philippine vessels, Duterte and Quiboloy have been shamelessly parroting Chinese propaganda lines.
It’s as if they’ve taken a masterclass in gaslighting Filipinos!
While reports of Chinese ships gathering near Philippine islands have sparked concern among the public, a recent national survey revealed that an overwhelming majority of Filipinos (70%) demand that the government defend their territory. This sentiment is shared across all social classes, proving that the people are not buying into the gaslighting tactics.
Surprisingly, the survey also showed that 65% of Filipinos declared their willingness to fight militarily to defend their territories. This resolute stance is coupled with a desire to modernize and strengthen the armed forces (61%).
The presence of Chinese workers in the country has been a cause for worry among 70% of Filipinos, as highlighted in a previous survey. It’s clear that the people are not taking China’s encroachment lightly and are ready to stand their ground.
In light of these concerns, the National Security Policy has rightly declared that the Philippines will stand by its cherished values as a sovereign nation. Upholding multilateralism and a rules-based international order, the Philippines remains committed to UNCLOS and the South China Sea Arbitration Award. Efforts to safeguard Philippine maritime zones, especially in the West Philippine Sea and Philippine Rise, will be strengthened through the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS). I
t’s a clear message that the Philippines is not backing down.
Duterte’s China visit has provided us with a bewildering tale of intrigue, conspiracy, and comedy. From the unexpected presence of Quiboloy to the criminal allegations surrounding both men, it’s hard not to be captivated by this bizarre episode.
As the Philippines faces the challenges of territorial disputes and Chinese encroachment, the resolute stance of the Filipino people shines through. With a majority demanding the defense of their territory and a willingness to fight, it’s clear that the comedy of errors won’t deter the nation’s determination.
The Philippines will continue to navigate the stormy waters, upholding its values and safeguarding its sovereignty.
Peace be upon you!

Breaking Free from the Clutches of the Inday Sara Duterte Cult: A Journey towards Personal Liberation and National Prosperity,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/breaking-free-from-the-clutches-of-the-inday-sara-duterte-cult-a-journey-towards-personal-liberation-and-national-prosperity/,"In today’s complex and interconnected world, it is disheartening to acknowledge the existence of cults that manipulate and exploit individuals for their own gain. Cults prey on vulnerability, promising solace, purpose, and belonging, only to ensnare their members in a web of psychological control. Escaping the clutches of a cult is an arduous and courageous journey, but it is possible.
When talking about cults, people often generally refer to religious or spiritual cults. But here in the Philippines, there is another kind of cultism and this is one where the focus of worship is a politician. This is by far a more damaging kind of cultism.
In this blog post, we will explore the steps and strategies necessary to break free from a cult and regain your autonomy and freedom.
Before embarking on the path towards liberation, it is crucial to understand the nature of cults. Cults are characterized by charismatic leaders who employ various psychological techniques to manipulate and control their followers. These techniques may include isolation, indoctrination, fear, and mind control. By understanding the tactics employed by cults, you can better equip yourself to break free from their grasp.
Recognizing that you are involved in a cult is the first step towards liberation. Cults often exhibit distinct characteristics, such as an all-encompassing devotion to the leader, strict control over members’ behavior and thoughts, isolation from outside influences, and the suppression of critical thinking. If you find yourself in a situation where your individuality and autonomy are constantly suppressed, it may be indicative of cult involvement.
Breaking free from a cult requires a strong support system. Cults often isolate their members from family and friends, making it difficult to seek help. Reach out to trusted individuals who are not affiliated with the cult, such as family, friends, or professionals experienced in cult recovery. They can provide emotional support, guidance, and help you navigate the challenges that lie ahead.
Knowledge is power when it comes to breaking free from a cult. Educate yourself about cult dynamics, mind control techniques, and the experiences of others who have successfully escaped. Books, documentaries, and online resources can provide valuable insights into the tactics employed by cults, helping you to better understand your situation and develop a plan for liberation.
Cults thrive by suppressing critical thinking and promoting blind obedience. Reclaiming your autonomy requires the reestablishment of critical thinking skills. Question the teachings, practices, and beliefs of the cult, and engage in independent research to validate or challenge their claims. Cultivate your ability to think critically, weigh evidence, and make informed decisions based on your own judgment.
Breaking free from a cult can be an emotionally and psychologically challenging process. Seeking professional help from therapists, counselors, or support groups specializing in cult recovery can provide invaluable guidance and support. These professionals can help you navigate the complex emotions, trauma, and confusion that often accompany cult involvement.
Leaving a cult requires careful planning to ensure your safety and minimize potential risks. Cults may use intimidation, coercion, or even physical force to prevent members from leaving. Develop a comprehensive exit strategy, including finding a safe place to stay, gathering important documents, and discreetly communicating your intentions to trusted individuals outside the cult.
Breaking free from a cult is just the beginning of a journey towards personal liberation. Rebuilding your life requires patience, self-compassion, and a commitment to self-discovery. Surround yourself with a supportive community, explore your interests and passions, and seek professional help if needed. Rediscover your identity, values, and aspirations, and embrace the freedom to live life on your own terms.
Escaping the clutches of a cult is an incredibly challenging endeavor, but it is possible with determination, support, and knowledge. Recognizing the signs, building a support network, educating yourself, developing critical thinking skills, seeking professional help, planning your exit strategically, and rebuilding your life are vital steps toward breaking free. Remember, you are not alone, and there is hope for a brighter future beyond the confines of a cult. Embrace your journey towards personal liberation, and reclaim your autonomy and freedom.
Peace be upon you!

VP Sara Duterte’s Ouster Imminent,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/vp-sara-dutertes-ouster-imminent/,"In the realm of politics, unexpected twists and turns are not uncommon.
Recent developments have sparked intense speculation regarding the future of Inday Sara Duterte, the daughter of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Rumors are circulating that her removal from the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and expulsion from the Marcos cabinet are imminent.
Although the inclusion of Inday Sara Duterte in the Marcos cabinet was done to fulfill some manner of power sharing agreement, her presence and participation in the administration has become a liability.
On top of the International Criminal Court’s summons and threat to issue an arrest warrant, Sara has also begun accumulating more and more detractors.
While it is a given that ACT Partylist Congresswoman France Castro as well as the rest of the Makabayan congressional bloc would continue attacking Inday Sara, this was also compounded by her failed attempt to wrest the speakership from Congressman Martin Romualdez — earning her the ire of those who support the House Speaker’s leadership.
And now, with increasing tensions between the Philippines and China, her very warm relationship with Beijing has come into question and created a new set of detractors accusing her of fostering a treasonous alliance.
This is notwithstanding the threat of an impeachment case being lodged against Inday Sara in connection with Castro’s allegation that the transfer of P125-million in confidential funds to OVP in 2022 was illegal as it did not go through the budget deliberations conducted by Congress. The allegation has become the basis of Castro’s call for an investigation into the use of confidential funds by the OVP.
Inday Sara is clearly becoming more and more of a liability — it is just a matter of time before Marcos jettisons her into the South China Sea.
The complex web of political rivalries and alliances in the Philippines further fuels speculation regarding Inday Sara Duterte’s future. As the country approaches barangay elections and the 2025 national elections, alliances are forming and shifting, with potential candidates vying for positions of power.
Moreover, Inday Sara Duterte’s critics argue that her rise to power is facilitated by her familial ties rather than her qualifications. Accusations of nepotism and abuse of power have been leveled against her, further intensifying the scrutiny surrounding her position in the Vice President’s office and the Marcos cabinet. If these allegations gain traction, it could prompt swift action from those seeking to maintain the integrity of the political system.
The potential ouster of Inday Sara Duterte from the Office of the Vice President and her expulsion from the Marcos cabinet would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences. It would not only reshape the political landscape but also impact the Duterte administration’s stability and future policies. Furthermore, it could potentially alter the dynamics of the upcoming national elections, influencing the choices of voters and candidates alike.
While rumors of Inday Sara Duterte’s imminent ouster from the Office of the Vice President and expulsion from the Marcos cabinet continue to circulate, it is crucial to approach such speculations with caution.
The complex nature of Philippine politics makes predicting the future with absolute certainty a challenging task. However, it is undeniable that the political climate is evolving rapidly, and the actions taken by key players will undoubtedly shape the country’s trajectory. As observers, we must remain vigilant and engaged, ensuring that our democratic processes continue to uphold the values of transparency and accountability.
Peace be upon you!

Personality and Hashtag Politics in a Circus Called “The Philippines”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/personality-and-hashtag-politics-in-a-circus-called-the-philippines/,"Photo credit goes to ClownPedia
It seems that we now have a new political warfare being waged in the Philippines between erstwhile allies belonging to the camp of former president Rodrigo Roa Duterte (FPRRD) and the camp of president Bongbong Marcos (PBBM). True to form, in terms of the maturity (or lack of) of the propaganda players, new political hashtags have been formed. The Duterte Die Hard Supporters (DDS) camp has propped up the #AntiBudol hashtag, implying that PBBM has swindled or double-crossed the Filipinos that elected him to the presidency. The PBBM camp has come up with the #ModernMakapili hashtag, implying that the DDS ilk is pro-China, especially when it comes to foreign policy. Lost in the brickbats thrown and pathetic drama of many of the two camps’ social media players and adherents are merits of their respective policy differences, as well as logic. But hey, we are talking about Philippine politics here. Since when have actual political ideologies and principles ever dominate personality politics in the Philippines?
Consider the recent issue on the Facebook page suspension of a few loud DDS social media influencers such as Sass Rogando Sasot. Earlier last week, her page was reportedly suspended, although at least some of her fellow Duterte sycophants claimed that it was “deleted”. Whatever the case may have been, what is crazy is that many Duterte supporters appear to jump the gun and point the blame on some sort of BlackOps perpetrated against them by First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, RJ Nieto (a.k.a. Thinking Pinoy), Mel Robles, and pretty much the entire PBBM administration. So according to the narrative being peddled, since Sasot and the likes of Sasot have been critical of the PBBM administration, the government is now suppressing their freedom of speech and expression. One uber DDS even claimed that there is now “Martial Law on Social Media”. It really makes one wonder why facts and conclusive evidence seem to get thrown out the window when DDS personalities, or even the Dutertes themselves, are in trouble. The blame always would have to point towards their perceived enemies!
This reminds me of a Jerry Seinfeld line describing how guilt is established merely using chalk outlines of crime victims. Seinfeld said:
It seems to me that the chalk-outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it’s not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. …  I don’t even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look at the thing on the ground. “Ahh, his arm was like that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must’ve been Jim.”
So, I guess the DDS is now applying some sort of Seinfeld logic. “Sasot has been critical of PBBM and his administration, so PBBM and his administration must’ve been the ones responsible for the suspension of her FB page!”
It really is so amazing how the DDS mind works. It seems to me that they do have a knack for backwards logic. Start with the conclusion that PBBM (and his circle) is applying some sort of BlackOps to take them and the Dutertes down, and support this claim using mere memories, impressions, or testimonies made by themselves (and of course, corroborated by their fellow administration critics who have an axe to grind against the current dispensation). To hell with evidentiary standards and logical methodology! For the DDS: “It’s the Duterte agenda, stupid!”
What we are seeing is personality politics in full display. It wreaks havoc on logic and the electorate’s political maturity. Identity politics gives more premium on a favored person or group over actual principle or policy. In our current DDS drama, identification with Duterte seems to have become some sort of shield for any moronic and unethical action or idea they come up with and do. To combat the perils of personality politics, we resort to hashtag politics – #AntiBudol vs. #ModernMakapili. Brilliant! Now I can honestly say that I do not blame some animals who eat their young!",Politics
"VP Sara, a Toothless Dog without Confidential Funds; Go, Bato to lose re-election bid",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/vp-sara-a-toothless-dog-without-confidential-funds-go-bato-to-lose-re-election-bid/,"The truth about Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte’s previous and proposed confidential funds is that it was and would have been used to fund her bloated political machinery to keep her relevant, in power, and within striking distance of the Presidency in 2028.
Her massive popularity wasn’t really naturally born out of her character and deeds as a leader of Davao City, but was merely an artificial creation funded by the billions of confidential funds she had access to when her father was still President of the Philippines.
President Bongbong Marcos Junior and his allies in both houses of congress would have allowed her the use of these types of funds had she shown the intent and capability to use it legally as well as judiciously. For one, she would have been useful to the Marcos Presidency by taking on the burden of being the face of frontline government services, i.e., education.
However, given VP Inday’s treacherous attempt to grab the House Speakership and then instigate an impeachment move to unseat Marcos Junior, she proved her inability to act even with the most basic bounds of loyalty — for what is a dog if it bites its master’s hand?
Now, having spent the last of her previous supply of confidential funds, the expensive political and publicity machinery that made her a fearsome public figure has ground to a halt.
Without her father in power and now without money to fund her artificial control/influence, she is a worthless and toothless political dog ready to be kicked in the backside.
Her approval numbers have slid and will continue to slide in the coming days. Moreover, we predict that she will eventually lose her appointment as Secretary of the Department of Education and even lose her position as the Co-Vice Chair of NTF ELCAC.
This is notwithstanding the fact that her satellite OVP offices might soon shutdown. Because, of what use are these offices anyway if not to serve as hubs for organizing and maintaining a campaign for her Presidential bid in 2028? Without the money to fund political operations, these satellite offices serve no purpose but to bleed out whatever remains of her political war chest — something which she must now try to save or… get away with?
Finally, the country will be spared from the buffoonery of Senators Bato Dela Rosa, Bong Go and Francis Tolentino. These senators, whose elections were funded out from ex President Rodrigo Duterte’s untrammelled discretionary powers, will now have to spend whatever they have left to fund a re-election. But, probably, being greedy — will only make a show of running for re-election and then slip away from view when their numbers don’t show up.
This is notwithstanding the fact that ex-President Duterte, VP Inday Sara, Senator Bato, and Senator Go are bound to face charges against them at the International Criminal Court as well as an assortment of cases connected with the Pharmally scam and others of the sort.
The most entertaining bit of this unfolding political drama will be the part where Inday, Bato and Go start going at each other’s throats as ex President Rodrigo Duterte watches them under an oxygen tent.ca

Foreign policy must never be dictated by emotions,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/foreign-policy-must-never-be-dictated-by-emotions/,"Tensions are rising between the Philippines and China, as activities in the West Philippine Sea are continuously being monitored, not only by their respective governments, but also by various countries who have tactical and strategic interests in these waters. From the recent water cannon incident which harassed fellow Filipinos, to beating the Chinese national basketball team in the recently held Asian Games, Filipino-Chinese relations are always being featured in various media outlets. Numerous individuals and groups are quick in pointing out Beijing’s bellicose actions, stirring national emotions further. Beating the drums of nationalism leads the country to take a jingoist stance. To make matters worse, politicians are willing to ride on this dangerous sentiment that is felt by these ordinary citizens. What are these politicians thinking about, and is it practical in protecting, promoting, and projecting our national interests?
To build international pressure against aggressive Chinese tactics in these contested waters, senators would say that the West Philippine Sea dilemma should be raised through the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). This proposition supported by some intellectuals provide the United States-Nicaragua issue as a concrete example. However, this is erroneous because it fails to recognize two distinct factors that separate these issues from each other, which are the differences between the internal socio-political structures of the United States and China, and the plausibility of gaining a significant number of favorable votes in the UNGA.
There are stark, polarizing differences in the current socio-political structures between the United States and China. The former is a representative democracy, where regular elections are held and elected leaders reflect the sentiments of their constituents, while the latter follows autocratic communism. Unlike Washington where the power to govern is derived from its people, Beijing derives its power from the Chinese Communist Party, which reflects its position as an entity above its own constitution. Unlike modern liberal democracies, Chinese constituents legitimize its government only if it brings order and prosperity, which is uncannily similar with how the dynastic mandate of heaven operated. Thus, popular public opinion holds more weight in both domestic and foreign policies in Washington than in Beijing. With polarizing politics affecting both the Democrats and the Republicans, the United States faces a herculean task in finding the balance between political will and political concessions. This American political setting seems completely incongruent with the Chinese, where its perennially strong state institutions are willing to exert its authority in the name of national interest.
Regarding the UNGA, passing resolutions in this multilateral organization is a numbers game, similar with how Philippine elections work. No matter how strong one’s case is in both legal and moral aspects, UN member countries have the tendency to favor what vote brings them greater benefits. Unlike Beijing, Manila is only a middle power and cannot easily influence the decisions of other countries. Taking a look at the Philippine diplomatic footprint in Africa is a tell-tale story of an uphill battle. Currently, the Philippines has embassies in Rabat, Johannesburg, Nairobi, Tripoli, Cairo, and Abuja, while China has diplomatic missions in all African capital cities, albeit for Eswatini. With Africa holding 55 votes in the UNGA and China having 54 embassies and 7 consulates in that continent, the Philippines has virtually zero assurance in winning the numbers game. In addition, Africa has historical relations with China, where Chinese admiral Zheng He has ventured  to East Africa during the Ming dynasty. In the economic front, does Manila even have a program that comes close in confronting Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)?
Unfortunately, many Filipinos and politicians seem unwilling to bridge the gap between what’s ideal from what’s practical, where they would rather point fingers at China instead of recalibrating its position. The West Philippine Sea issue has been continuing for more than five decades, and its peaceful and amicable resolution seems to be lightyears away. In addition, weak Philippine state institutions make Manila subservient to American pressure, where it doesn’t help in formulating pragmatic solutions. Washington’s intervention in Philippine affairs complicates the pursuance of an independent foreign policy, which is a constitutional mandate. American brands of exceptionalism and idealism is not applicable for this increasingly multipolar world order. On the other hand, despite its century-old historical grievances against China, a different Asian country is forging its own path. Enter India.
India, the crown jewel of British imperialism, became an independent nation-state in 1947. After being siphoned of its resources by the United Kingdom for nearly a century, it became a country renowned for its dehumanizing poverty. Starvation, political instability, and economic mismanagement was an everyday occurrence, where Great Britain continued harassing and abusing the Indian subcontinent. These internal weaknesses did not stop the Indian civilization from adopting a prudent foreign policy through then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which serves as the main blueprint framing China-India relations. These contentious territorial disputes in Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh, and Kashmir separates New Delhi and Beijing, served as stern reminders for their leaders not to depend on external powers in defending themselves. Indian foreign policy is firmly grounded on Indian realpolitik for numerous decades, where New Delhi refused to align itself with larger and more influential powers. During the Cold War, India military hardware was primarily based on Soviet technology and adopted Russian manufactured arms. However, with the current geopolitical dynamics, New Delhi is beginning to adopt western technologies from Washington and Paris. These can be observed with their Brahmos missiles and Tejas jet fighters, where parts of these respective technologies can be derived from both Russia and the United States, respectively. But what significantly changed the power calculations regarding India was the Smiling Buddha, making India the first non-permanent member-state of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that conducted a successful nuclear bomb test.
In the diplomatic front, India is making its presence felt by maintaining its cordial relations with Tehran, Riyadh, and Moscow, while building bridges with Paris, Washington, and Canberra. Considering India’s cognizance of its national interests, it understood that India will play an integral role in shaping the new world order. Despite of their territorial disputes with Beijing, New Delhi’s avenues for conducting dialogue are always present in various multilateral organizations through BRICS, G-20, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). India also makes its presence felt in the UN, where they continuously participate and sends boots on the ground through its peace-keeping missions.
India is making significant strides in the fronts of economics and politics. Presently, New Delhi purchases affordable hydrocarbons from Moscow, fueling its economic growth. Economic reforms by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have significantly liberalized its economy, cutting bureaucratic red tape that made it an economically irrelevant country during the Cold War years. With the promotion of the “Make in India” campaign, and paired with its youthful and gigantic population, New Delhi is poised to overtake Tokyo and Berlin as the third largest economy in 10 years.
The enviable position of India was not built in one night. It was created with a strong understanding of its national interests and its continuous attempts in internally reforming the political, economic, and social structures of their country. Instead of blaming China for their bellicose actions near their borders, Indians sought to strengthen themselves, and eventually stand toe to toe with the Chinese, while ensuring that opportunities for diplomacy are always present through their multilateral organizations. Unfortunately, Manila would rather point fingers at Beijing’s aggressive actions, without reflecting that the Philippines direly needs to reform its political and economic institutions for these incursions to stop. Unless Filipinos feel mortified on how pathetic and feeble the country’s political and economic state is, Chinese aggressions are here to stay.",Politics
"VP Duterte’s Performance Rating Drops Big, Speaker Romualdez Climbs In Latest OCTA Research Survey",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/vp-dutertes-performance-rating-drops-big-speaker-romualdez-climbs-in-latest-octa-research-survey/,"VP Inday Sara Duterte’s survey numbers are headed for a steep nose dive in the OCTA Research 2023 Performance Ratings of Top Government Officials.
Duterte lost 12 percentage points from her July 2023 rating of 82 percent, leaving her at 70 percent. The biggest drop in her ratings came from Visayas, a drop of 16 percent points from 90 percent in July to 74 and Balance Luzon, fell by 12 percentage points from 84 percent in July to 72 percent. Her ratings also fell by 9 percent in Mindanao, from 96 percent in July to 87.
House Speaker Martin Romualdez gained six percentage points, climbing from 55 percent in July to 61 percent. His biggest increase of 22 percentage points came from Balance Luzon, climbing from 39 percent in July to 61 percent. His rating in Mindanao fell 12 percent from 67 percent in July to 55 and likewise, in Visayas he lost 10 percentage points, moving down from 80 down to 70 percent.
If I were to speculate just based on the numbers published by various websites and newspapers, I’d say this is still more evidence resulting from her botched power grab attempt and the controversy surrounding her over half a billion peso proposed confidential/intelligence funds.
Between the failed power grab and the confidential funds controversy, I’d say it was the latter that caused most people to give her a lower performance rating.
It didn’t help, either, that news of her multi billion confidential and intelligence fund spending while she was Davao City mayor made the rounds.
Word is that Duterte had spent a previously granted P125 million of confidential funds to set up 16 satellite offices which is apart the six OVP satellite offices. These secret or rather not so secret satellite offices, says our source, would form the hub of her political operations throughout the country.
No wonder it took just 11 days for her to spend P125 million pesos!
All that money went into either the construction or lease of not so secret political lairs and lined the pockets of political operators who would presumably build up VP Sara’s political machinery.
It is in this way that confidential funds, which are supposed to be used to support intelligence work against terrorists and criminals, appears to have been used as pork barrel funds.
Pork barrel funds, also known as earmarks, refer to the allocation of government funds for specific projects or programs that serve the interests of a particular legislator’s constituency.
While the intention behind pork barrel spending may be to address local needs and promote economic development, it is widely regarded as a practice that fosters corruption, undermines fiscal responsibility, and perpetuates inequality.
Firstly, the discretionary nature of pork barrel funds allows politicians to direct resources towards their own districts, often without proper scrutiny or oversight. This creates an environment ripe for favoritism and cronyism, as politicians may prioritize projects that benefit their own political careers rather than those that genuinely serve the public interest.
Secondly, the use of pork barrel funds can lead to wasteful spending and inefficient resource allocation. Projects funded through pork barrel appropriations are often driven by political considerations rather than objective criteria, resulting in a lack of cost-benefit analysis and proper evaluation. This can result in the funding of unnecessary or low-priority projects, diverting resources away from more pressing needs such as education, healthcare, or infrastructure. Moreover, the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding pork barrel spending makes it difficult to track the effectiveness and impact of these funds, further exacerbating the potential for misuse and waste.
The practice of using pork barrel funds is plagued by inherent problems that undermine the principles of good governance and public trust. The potential for corruption and favoritism, coupled with the wasteful allocation of resources, make it imperative for governments to reevaluate and reform this system. By promoting transparency, accountability, and evidence-based decision-making, policymakers can ensure that public funds are utilized in a manner that truly benefits the broader society and advances the common good.

Is PRRD Suffering from Dementia or Faking It as a Prelude for House Arrest Plea?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/is-prrd-suffering-from-dementia-or-faking-it-as-a-prelude-for-house-arrest-plea/,"News about former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte being taken to the hospital for a check up after slipping inside his house spread all over social media.
His dwindling number of followers were besides themselves, airing their concern and sympathy all over social media with prayers and wishes for the former president’s recovery.
We can imagine detractors taking to ridiculing and heaping curses on the former chief executive, perhaps some even saying that an unexpected death would be too kind for him.
But for certain, others aired suspicions that this was merely an act to lay the predicate for him claiming to have some manner of health condition that would somehow exempt him from an impending trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.
Among the comments on a Facebook post by ABS CBN News page say:
“susunod niyan wheelchair at neck brace” and “ICC is coming, wheelchair is needed”
Both comments referencing former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s supposed neck injury that was a basis for seeking “medical attention” in the US and later the basis for being allowed house arrest at the Veteran Memorial Medical Center after being charged for plunder which the Supreme Court acquitted her of a few days after Duterte assumed presidency in 2016.
Still others recalled Duterte’s admission of abusing his prescription of fentanyl, a drug he claims to have used to manage pain following a motorcycle accident. The implication could have been that he had somehow managed to get doses of the drug and fell over from being high on the controlled substance.
It could also be speculated that, given his advanced age as well as slurred speech, sudden violent outbursts, disjuncted often rambling remarks, failure to recall words as well as names of people and unsteady gait; the former president could be suffering from advancing dementia.
A website of the National Institute for Aging describes dementia as, “…the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities. Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person’s functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.”
We aren’t certain if former president duterte is already wearing diapers or really still recognizes his daughter, Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, but certainly a condition such as this might support motions to put him under hospital arrest while undergoing trial at the ICC.
It is unclear to us, however, if dementia could be considered as a basis for an insanity plea in a trial where the former president is accused of murdering or having order the murder of thousands of Filipinos from the time that he was still Mayor of Davao City to the time that he became the President.
All things considered. President Bongbong Marcos should consider offering former president Duterte the best of care at Elsie Gaches Village or Golden Acres or some other similar institution.

Sen. Imee Marcos Lied About Not Knowing About DSWD’s AKAP,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/02/sen-imee-marcos-lied-about-not-knowing-about-dswds-akap/,"When Senator Imee Marcos said she was surprised to discover DSWD’s AKAP program, it sounded so contrived it appeared farcical — even more garish and gaudy than the Tiktoks or short films she makes.
Perhaps it was her botoxified face that caused the gleaming disconnect with telling of being caught unaware or suddenly discovering the “magically appearing” DSWD social amelioration program.
Or, maybe, she could blame her loss of memory on the dozens of rounds of general anesthesia that she underwent in her battle with diminishing collagen and gravity.
Yet, more… It could simply be that she was lying.
It was a good thing though that documents don’t lie and that House Senior Deputy Speaker Aurelio Gonzales Jr. even presented the press with the exact page of the then-proposed 2024 national budget where provisions for the P26.7-billion Ayuda sa Kapos ang Kita Program were stated.
At least one report even says Gonzales said that Marcos signed the very page where the insertion was made.
As written in a news article:
Gonzales then showed that Senator Imee Marcos — who questioned why these funds existed in the first place — signed the same page in the General Appropriations Bill (GAB) during the bicameral conference committee hearing.
“Para malinawan lang po natin, ito po oh, nakabilog ‘yong pangalan niya (Senator Marcos), na pumirma siya sa bicam report, sana po tinignan niya ‘to, this P26.7 billion. Binulugan ko po ‘yong pangalan niya, ako po nakapirma po ako dito,” Gonzales said.
Source: https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1904146/fwd-magic-project-gonzales-says-senate-approved-funding-for-akap#ixzz8RthQVf00
But what does an Imee Marcos do when faced with seemingly Incontrovertible evidence contradicting her claims of not knowing about AKAP?
She claims it was an e-signature as a way of giving the impression that it had been affixed without by someone other than her without her knowledge.
But what do we expect from a woman who, when asked about how she felt when Davao City mayor Pulong Duterte called on her brother President Bongbong Marcos to resign, claimed that the mayor said sorry. Only to be rebuffed later by the mayor for using his name as part of her “drama”.
Thing is, we’re not surprised at all by her deceit. After all, she was named after her mother, whose tales of vaults of gold and the secrets of the Filipino creationism bears some semblance to the magical realism of One Hundred Years of Solitude.
Quite apt and even poignant is the phrase from Gabriel Garcia Marquez, “…time was not passing…it was turning in a circle…” (“…el tiempo no estaba pasando… estaba girando en círculo…”)
As it was back in the last days of the first Marcos regime, the edifices built to glorify their rule was built with thievery and lies.
As it was then, so it is now…

Demolishing Inday Sara Duterte: the VP needs a more competent comms team and smarter “influencers”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/demolishing-inday-sara-duterte-the-vp-needs-a-more-competent-comms-team-and-smarter-influencers/,"I’m now 50% convinced that there’s an active effort to undermine not only the Vice-President but the Duterte brand in an effort to ensure that their political brand is rendered inutile by painting them as corrupt and traitors to the country. I was wondering how and why Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner Jr would make a statement that there is an active destabilization plot against the administration of President Bongbong Marcos. But the parroting of the same line by inauspicious individuals on social media has confirmed that Brawner didn’t act on his own. It was scripted.
It’s not hard to imagine that behind all of these is Uncle Sam, who isn’t willing to relinquish the “gains” it has made with the country’s pivot back to the US. The Americans have grand plans for the region in light of its looming defeat in Ukraine.Its president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been abandoned as a lost cause. It remains to be seen what his fate will be considering Russia isn’t willing to negotiate peace yet. But for the most part, there is no fight left in Zelensky and the Ukraine armed forces. The Americans are now looking at China, which it views as the bigger threat compared to Russia.
This is probably what Duterte foresaw when he made the statement about Marcos being a weak leader and why he wanted Inday to either run for president or be Bong Go’s running mate. He meant to continue what he started and prevent the Marcoses from taking control of the country back. But that didn’t happen so now, Vice President Inday Sara Duterte has to lie on the bed she made for herself.
Duterte rarely makes an uncalculated move. At this point, he knows that he and his daughter don’t have the financial wherewithal to organize an opposition against the Marcoses. Not even GMA joining them would their chances improve. The politicians know better also because the administration allies are the primary beneficiaries of largesse in terms of projects for their constituents. What we find ourselves in now is a democracy without an opposition because the traditional opposition has been stupid to the point that the people wouldn’t want to be caught dead on their side.
The opposition is still hoping that their old strategy will work but with a twist; they are counting on seeing Marcos throw the old man under the bus and feed him to the International Criminal Court (ICC). If this happens, all hell will break loose and we might see a genuine destabilization plot gain popular support. But Marcos isn’t stupid. The 2025 election will be a crucial bellwether event for the administration. It will determine their chances for 2028 with the caveat that a so-so performance in 2025 will most likely result in the adoption of an alternative means to get Marcos’s anointed elected in 2028 for the continued subservience to Uncle Sam.
The wildcard in the Marcos camp is the president’s sister Senator Imee Marcos-Manotoc. She is family but she’s also the type who can go against the family decision given that she has given in to their wishes of seeing the only son become president like their father.
For now, Inday is in limbo between the Devil and the deep blue sea. While the president doesn’t have animosity against her, he still isn’t doing anything to stop the ongoing demolition job against her. But this is the natural consequence of going against the advise of one who is wiser and more experienced in politics.
For now, Inday has to grin and bear it but she definitely has to get better people around her and exert the utmost effort to address the education crisis. This is the only way she can prove to her supporters that she is capable of being her father’s successor.",Politics
Yellowtard columnists now cheer Philippine President Bongbong Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/yellowtard-columnists-now-cheer-philippine-president-bongbong-marcos/,"Never thought I’d see the day when a rabid Yellowidiot writes a praise piece for the president whom they have been ripping apart politically since 1986. PhilStar columnist Andrew Masigan writes in his piece today how his “worst fears about another Marcos presidency is looking more unlikely to occur”. Masigan further writes…
My fears, borne out of painful memories of impunity, corruption, cronyism and entitlement, were assuaged by Marcos Junior’s circumspect style of leadership. He seems careful not to make a mistake and is averse to disrupting stability. Sure, there is a good cop-bad cop scenario at play with Speaker Martin Romualdez playing the role of the latter. But all things considered, BBM has erred on the safe side in as far as socio-economic and geopolitical policies are concerned.
This marks a first in the political history of the country. In the politics of switcheroo, the Dutertes (led by former President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter, current Vice President Inday Sara Duterte) are now the villains. To my mind, this is just the enforcement of the social caste, hence my mantra that the optics are excellent in the Marcos administration.
The noise in social media over the Marcos-Romualdez combine is not doing any side any good. The same is true with the resignation calls and the rumored destabilization plots. Been there. Tried that. Didn’t work. Best to bring it to the ballot and let the people decide. But don’t expect any tangible reforms any time soon. It takes political will to do that, with strongarm tactics thrown in.
It’s like the ongoing public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization project. After all the protests and warnings about the deadline, the jeepneys are still on the streets. This says a lot about our government and the people. And this is also why we have been left behind by our neighbors and still beset with third world problems.
This is the same reason why you need a president who’s not a statesman but more of an enforcer. It’s the only way to get the bureaucracy to enforce the law.",Politics
"Over 200,000 EMBO Residents Taste Bitter Loss of Makati Citizen Benefits",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/over-200000-embo-residents-taste-bitter-loss-of-makati-citizen-benefits/,"New years typically begin with new hopes and new dreams, but this will not be the case for over 200,000 former Makati Citizens living in ten EMBOs or enlisted men’s barrios that have been given over to Taguig City by Supreme Court Decision in 2021.
The former Makati Citizens knew this was coming and if they could have prepared for the loss of their benefits from the Makati City Government, they surely would have — only they aren’t like residents of Makati’s posh villages. For EMBO residents, these benefits are a literal life line — sans health insurance and private pension benefits which only but a few could really afford.
Makati Mayor Abby Binay, daughter of former Vice President Jojo Binay, certainly would have sent memos warning her clan’s former voters that Makati would no longer be footing the bill for their kids education, their dialysis treatment, free hospitalization, medicines for life-long diseases, and others.
But, why even waste postage costs for memos?! Exactly 140 recently elected barangay leaders of the EMBOs took their oath of office before Mayor Abby herself on November 2023! Represented were the barangays of  Cembo, Comembo, East Rembo, Pembo, Pitogo, South Cembo, West Rembo, Rizal, Post Proper Northside, and Post Proper Southside.
Certainly a strange event considering that these barangays are now supposedly under Taguig City!
But here’s the thing that’s probably not so strange and only an old time Makati resident would know, especially having been so close to the Binays for decades… These barangay officials probably owed their political careers to the Binays and benefited from the largesse of the Binay political dynasty.
How did one story go? I can’t remember if it involved generous allotment from the city or a piece of whatever pie. Nevertheless, whatever it was, it was certainly enough for these officials to troop to Mayor Binay’s office for an oath taking ceremony.
But… but… but… Their barangays are now under Taguig and even they also took their oaths of office before Taguig City Mayor Lani Cayetano, it would make the other oath taking ceremony frivolous — thus the issue would ensue of which oath taking ceremony took place first.
Aaaah.. so early in their term and already mired in controversy. From a strictly political point of view, it doesn’t do these barangay officials well to act in seeming defiance against the Supreme Court as well as Taguig City where they now belong.
The Taguig City Government, on the other hand, had not been remiss in its efforts to provide for its new constituents — albeit encumbered intricate legal issues.
According to an article in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which I will block quote here:
In September last year, the Taguig City government turned down Makati’s proposal to establish a credit line to ensure that Embo residents would continue to have access to the latter’s health centers and OsMak. It cited concerns about ownership and contended that the proposal went against the directive of Health Secretary Ted Herbosa to exclude ownership matters from the transition process.
Taguig, on the other hand, has its own health program for residents. According to the local government’s website, it provides free dialysis and medicines for the sick, especially senior citizens. There are also newly established “super health centers” that offer free diagnostic laboratory services and can respond to the “immediate health needs of its citizens,” it added.
In May, it entered into a multi-year agreement with St. Luke’s Medical Center-Global City to extend further medical support to residents who may avail themselves of hospital services for medical and surgical cases if endorsed by the City Health Office. The transfer of jurisdiction over the 10 Embo barangays from Makati to Taguig has not been without problems.
In August, the Department of Education (DepEd) was forced to take over supervision of the management and administration of 14 public schools caught in the turf war between the two local governments. This was after Makati City accused Taguig officials of trying to take over the schools without a writ of execution or legal order.
It is a pity that, from the looks of it, Makati is playing up the misery of its former “citizens” to make Taguig City look bad.

House Speaker Martin Romualdez blasted allegations reportedly from Sen. Imee Marcos saying that he was funding a people’s initiative campaign aimed at constitutional change and even offering P20 million per district.
In his words, he said “Huwag niyong pansinin ang pinsan kong Marites.” (Translation: “Pay no attention to the intrigues sown by my cousin.)
But what would drive Senator Imee to fall for speculation instead of just calling up Speaker Martin for a heart to heart just as any Manang would? Did she miss a dose or something?

That is baseless. Kausapin niyo na lang siya, nagma-maritess siguro or nakikinig dun sa maritess. I would like her to prove it. She has the proper means and ways to go to whatever forum, even the COMELEC. She can try to prove it. Kasi maraming maritess ang lumalabas diyan sa senate eh. A lot of speculation. Let’s leave it up to them. Laging sinasabi ni Madame Senator na kausap ko daw si ganito. I hardly get to speak to the good senator my cousin, I wasn’t able to see her over the holidays, she was apparently out of town. I haven’t been able to speak to her recently, so I don’t know where all of this is coming from… about her interpreting how I am nagtatampo… hindi ako nagtatampo sa kanya. I respect her as my cousin, as my senator. I leave it at that. She can call me or text me any time, if she prefers to do it in the media… that is her prerogative. But there is no truth to that.
In any case, charter change or amendment IS an idea whose time has come and the senate seems vainly fighting against it for no other reason other than fear that the prestige of their billionaire’s club might be diluted. Hence the theatrics of the likes of Sen. Joel Villanueva and others identified with the Dutertes.
On another issue, that of allegedly attacking or being behind attacks against Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, Speaker Romualdez said:
“On my part, I have not attacked any ally of this administration. I don’t know what she is talking about. I respect her as the Vice President and as Secretary of Education, she has my full support. I don’t know what I have said or done to attack her,” Romualdez told reporters.
“Please identify those actuations, if any. Kung nakikinig siya sa mga marites o kaninong senadora diyan, that is up to her,” he added.

"Rody Duterte’s Alleged Fentanyl Driven Rant Threatens PH Security, Stability",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/rody-dutertes-alleged-fentanyl-driven-rant-threatens-ph-security-stability/,"Former Philippine President Rody Duterte’s alleged fentanyl driven rants against President Bongbong Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez at what was supposed to be a prayer rally in Davao City has been met with overwhelming push-back from the broader swath of Philippine society.
Speaker Romualdez quipped that Duterte shouldn’t be throwing stones in his proverbial glass house, but personally, I’d advise the former president against raging inside a padded cell.
Apart from the wild and unsubstantiated accusation that President Marcos was drug addled and an addict, the eighty year old former president also accused Speaker Romualdez (and alternatively, congress-at-large) of bribing people to support a People’s Initiative to amend the Philippine Constitution. Duterte made unsubstantiated claims that efforts to amend the four decade old constitution was intended to install a parliamentary form of government which would enable the Marcoses to perpetuate themselves in power indefinitely.
Duterte described congressmen supporting the people’s initiative as greedy and even accused First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos of being power hungry.
Watching the whole thing unfold over nearly an hour was like watching a psychotic vagrant raging in the middle of EDSA and I actually found myself wishing for Duterte to stop making a fool of himself.
Clapping back on Duterte’s putrid antics, President Marcos responded with compassion saying that the former president’s state of mind could have been brought about by years of fentanyl use and that his doctors should take better care of him.
Speaker Romualdez, at a party leaders’ caucus just a few hours after Duterte’s embarrassing rant on January 28, said that, “Sa pamilyang Duterte, siguro konting galang naman sa ating mahal na Presidente tsaka sa pamilya niya. Noong panahon ninyo, iginalang namin kayo. Masyadong maaga naman ninyo gustong ipabagsak ang rehimen ni Bongbong.”
As far as constitutional amendments are concerned, Romualdez also rightly pointed out that Duterte had actually used his office as well as line agencies to push for what amounts to an overhaul of the constitutions political provisions by turning the country into a union of federated states.
“Pederalismo. Yan ay hindi lang amendment ng political provisions, kung hindi pagbabago ng buong system of government. Mukhang hindi niya nakayanan gawin. Baka at the very least, binubudol-budol tayo noon, kasi yang (pederalismo) ang naging basihan ng pagtakbo niya bilang presidente. Tapos maalala rin natin na sabi niya na in six months matatapos niya ang problema ng bansa sa drugs, pero sa anim na taon niya may drugs pa rin. Maganda mag-isip isip muna siya bago magsalita.”
A shift to a union of federated Philippine states would have enabled the Duterte’s to perpetuate themselves as the “forever” kings/queens of a Mindanao State and this is a far worse than merely allowing full foreign ownership in the Philippines. This actually entails breaking up the country and paving the way for a Duterte Kingdom of Mindanao.
Romualdez didn’t mention it, but as far as so-called greed for money is concerned, Duterte’s administration has been accused of misspending a considerable portion of the P7.6 Trillion national debt that he generated as well as the fact that his daughter, VP Inday Sara Duterte spent P125 Million in 11 days and son, Congressman Pulong Duterte, is being questioned over the P51 billion in congressional allotments to his district.
Indeed, as Romualdez put it, “People living in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.”

Leni Robredo remains the WORST president the Philippines never had,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/leni-robredo-remains-the-worst-president-the-philippines-never-had/,"Members of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis now gloating over the fracturing of the once mighty “Unity Team” of President Bongbong Marcos and Vice President Inday Sara Duterte wax sentiment over how failed 2022 presidential candidate Leni Robredo could have been leader of the Filipino people instead. Emphasis is on the “could have been” because highlighting that useless sentiment prompts one to apply a bit of hindsight in the utterly incompetent campaign Robredo mounted during that “important” election.
I originally considered the title “Leni Robredo remains the worst president the Philippines
almost had” for this piece to highlight how Filipinos escaped what would have been a tragic fate. That title wouldn’t have worked, however, because Robredo stood no chance of winning that election to begin with. Even in the early days of the campaign, the Opposition were already a hopelessly disorganised and incoherent bunch of bickering morons. The real hindsight here, as such, is that the massive landslide that characterised the election victory of the Marcos-Duterte tandem in 2022 was really no surprise. The outcome of the 2022 election was a perfect storm — a confluence of the brilliant campaign of Marcos (primarily) and the idiotic one led by Robredo.
To suggest then that the Yellowtards and commies are vindicated by what they would like to regard as a failing incumbent administration is utter nonsense. This is why this clownish axis of incoherence can be seen today scrounging for strategic relevance using short-sighted tactics — clinging to a foreign “court” to prosecute their shrill cases and inciting civil unrest and even coup d’etats consistent with their obsolete Leninist strategies , among others — and then, failing all that, ending up today having to share a bed with their traditional enemy who they once referred to as “Son of the Dictator”.
If one steps back and takes a helicopter view of Philippine politics, one can see that the Philippines has reverted back to an all-too-familiar pattern — one of a feudal society governed by remote control by its overlords in Washington DC and Rome. Taking this perspective, it is easy to see that the flypaper “issues” that the buzzing community of local political “bloggers” and “influencers” sling mud at one another over are of no real global consequence. And this is why the Philippines today remains a quaint regional laughingstock. It is the only ASEAN nation that continues to maintain a big fat umbilical cord to its former colonial masters through which nutrients are pumped to feed Filipinos’ insatiable hunger for foreign validation.
It can be argued that the previous administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte gave Filipinos their first taste of real independence and, on the back of that, credibility amongst their peers in the region. In late 2016, I wrote in my piece “Duterte is turning the Philippines back into a REAL southeast Asian country”, how “Southeast Asia is home to autocratic ‘democracies’ — states that have, one way or another, found a balance between outwardly being what the West think the world’s nations ought to be and, from the inside, being what they really are”. Furthermore…
…to be truly southeast Asian is to grow and develop according to one’s sovereign terms. This is how Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia did it. And this is how Vietnam and the other new Indochinese members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are doing it. Duterte is showing Filipinos an option that, in all ironies, never occurred to them — that it can be done the southeast Asian way. The American Way was a fun ride in Disneyland. But to prosper in the manner that only southeast Asia does, the Philippines needs to go back to the basics and start planting rice.
Armed with this context, one can now imagine what path a Robredo presidency would have taken Filipinos down — a path to further mediocrity and national limpdickedness. Perhaps then this could be the reason behind the sudden coziness to the Marcos admin that the Yellowtards are exhibiting nowadays. The insight here is that, in ideological terms, it seems the Yellowtards are really not that different to the Marcostards. Take the Martial Law Crybabyism out of the Yellowtards’ little brains and, voilà, it all becomes a nice and peachy motley crew of usual suspects out to commit a good old fashioned all-too-familiar Philippine government heist. And the best thing about this is that Robredo didn’t even have to be President of the Philippines!",Politics
"Instead of Helping Flood Victims, Sen. Imee, Bato, and Bong Go Engage in Politicking",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/02/instead-of-helping-flood-victims-sen-imee-bato-and-bong-go-engage-in-politicking/,"Ex President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s fentanyl addled rant at a rally in Davao City was merely the foretaste of grotesque politicking that would happen days later on February 2.
Senator Imee Marcos, the older (some say half) sister of president Bongbong Marcos, flew to flooded Davao City to continue her campaign to have Speaker Martin Romualdez ousted through political witch hunt against the purveyors of what she claims to be a fake People’s Initiative.
The deaths and suffering of six thousand families in several Davao provinces were not enough to stop Senator Imee from conducting the hearing which ultimately turned out nothing of any sort that would directly and credibly connect Speaker Romualdez to the people’s initiative.
Neither did it turn out even JUST ONE case of any one admitting they were paid money or any manner of goods in exchange for their signature for the People’s Initiative.
The meeting dragged on for hours even as people outside where the senate hearing was being held shivered in the cold as they watched their homes and belongings get destroyed by muddy flood waters.
The howls of despair and the cries of starving children were muffled by Senator Imee’s mannish voice that strained and failed to conjure an evil more tangible, immediate evil of corruption that led to the flooding of the place she was in.
The funniest thing about the whole farce of a senate hearing was that the reported cases of “signatures for sale” all came from Davao City — which is the political bailiwick of the Dutertes.
It’s easy enough to surmise that if ever there were any one claiming to have been bribed, these people would probably a diehard Duterte cult follower or someone they had coerced.
Rightly, Deputy Speaker David “Jayjay” Suarez spoke out against Senator Imee Marcos and urged her to stop the investigation into the People’s Initiative.
“In the continuation of the investigation in Davao City, Senator Marcos’ committee has not presented any witnesses to prove that bribery occurred. All the witnesses stated that they did not receive any money. That is very clear.
“It seems that Senator Imee is just insisting that bribery happened. Her problem is that wherever she goes, and whoever they summon, everyone says that no money was given to them.”

In times of disaster, politicking is detrimental on multiple levels.
It diverts attention and resources away from the critical needs of the affected population. Instead of focusing on relief efforts and effective crisis management, political leaders may become preoccupied with scoring points, undermining the urgency of the situation. This can hinder the rapid response and coordination necessary to address the immediate needs of those impacted by the disaster.
When politicians prioritize their own agendas over the well-being of the people, it fosters a sense of division and distrust among the population. This can impede the collective effort needed to overcome the challenges posed by the disaster, hindering the effectiveness of relief efforts and prolonging the recovery process.

Marcostards or Dutertards could become the next Yellowtards. So don’t be a tard.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/marcostards-or-dutertards-could-become-the-next-yellowtards-so-dont-be-a-tard/,"What really matters to most ordinary people? Simple. Food, security, and certainty. In a Third World “democracy” such as the Philippines, most successful politicians are able to distil their messaging down to what ticks those three boxes. Taking this perspective, it is easy to see how former President Rodrigo Duterte sustained his popularity, trust, and confidence ratings over much of his term in office. He may have not crushed the competition in 2016 the way current President Bongbong Marcos did in 2022, but Duterte became notable for the oustanding feat of keeping his public opinion numbers buoyant ’til the very end.
Marcos, on the other hand, went on to become the first post-1986 president to ever take office on the back of a majority vote; and not just a majority vote, a crushing win that decimated an Opposition that foolishly allowed itself to be led by the usual suspects of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis. Unfortunately for him, however, Marcos now struggles to sustain his political capital — at least the part of it to do with public opinion.
A Pulse Asia poll taken in April this year showed Marcos’s approval rating fall to 78% from 82% recorded in November, 2022 and his trust rating to 80% from 82% over the same period. More recently, Pulse Asia reported that, based on polls taken in September of this year, Marcos’s performance rating had plunged to just 65% of survey respondents.
Perception is everything. While access to food is the most objective measure of wellbeing (i.e., you either have enough of it or you don’t), people’s feelings surrounding security and certainty are open to influence. Politicking and power plays in the king’s court may get a Filipino politician somewhere. But it is in the Court of Public Opinion where real power is forged. This was evident in how the Yellowtards played the former well but ultimately lost because of their incompetence in the latter. The Yellowtards had all the right connections — to media, to the chi chi private school set, to the loudmouths of the Church, to the noisy “activist” mob, and to the shrill “songbirds” of Pinoy showbiz, you name it — the Yellowtards had them all by the balls. And yet, they suffered the most catastrophic, the most embarassing, and the most important electoral defeat in recent Philippine history.
Why did the Yellowtards lose despite their traditional political assets? They failed to convince Filipinos that, under their regime (and perhaps that of their communist chums), people will be well-nourished, feel safe, and feel optimistic about their futures. Instead of crafting messaging that talked to those, they alienated big swathes of voters by building their pitch to them  around irrelevant woke “issues” — gender equality, gay rights, “human rights” and all that is sugar and spice and everything nice to the virtue signalling agendas of the iPad-tapping latte-sipping set.
The lesson is simple, really. Don’t be like the Yellowtards. Don’t be a Dutertard or a Marcostard. Be people who think critically.
The Yellowtards dropped the ball because they became a cult of personality that worshipped dead personalities, made statues of them and worshipped those statues. Somewhere along the way they left their brains — which cost entire family fortunes to fill with textbook stuff — in Katipunan. Don’t carry on this tradition lest you leave yours in España or Taft Avenue.
It’s simple, really. Winning elections is all about getting a good feel for what keeps ordinary people awake at night. And whenever they do get some shuteye, the first thing that will be on their minds as they rise from their banigs in the morning is how many meals they will get to eat today, whether they will be able to get onto a jeepney or bus to and from work, whether they will come home in one piece, and whether or not they would be able to sustain this same daily routine over the next six months at the very least. Which politician’s face can be associated to answers to these worries will be the one who will go on to win the next election.

It seems Romualdez would rather spend his tax-funded time campaigning for the next election than doing his job crafting laws in his office. Then again stunts like this usually work, to be fair — because Filipinos are always up for a bit of free food scraps tossed at them by one or the other two-bit politician.
One does not need to look too far back to find an example of this sort of dishonest behaviour in former senator and failed presidential wannabe Mar Roxas who spent most of his time in the various offices he occupied performing before the cameras.
Behaviour like this is usually most evident in the lead up to an election. The timing of Romualdez’s quaint stunts is astounding in that it has only been a bit more than a year since the last national elections in 2022 and he is already on the campaign trail wasting people’s already-small attention spans. Yet it is unlikely that people like Romualdez, in their normal daily lives, ever give their next meal a second thought. Indeed, most people like him expect a proper breakfast spread laid out for them by their servants every morning as a matter of normal routine among other things.
The only real way politicians can convince people they are for real is to live like real Filipinos over a long enough period of time that actually hurts. Sometime back within the context of similar PR stunts involving politicians being photographed taking public transport to show their “solidarity” with hapless Filipino commuters I proposed in my piece “How can Metro Manila ever improve if Filipino politicians do not take public transport?” how one could really walk the talk…
If Filipino polticians want to make epal, why not make them do it all the way. Here is what I propose Filipinos — Metro Manilans in particular — demand of their politicians:
Start taking public transport everyday for the next two years leading to the 2016 elections.

But if Filipino politicians want to demonstrate how serious they are about improving the lot of ordinary Filipinos who, as part of their day-to-day lives, suffer the results of decades of government mismanagement, they should show Filipinos that they can take personal accountability for the idiocy of the government they want to be officers of.
If House Speaker Martin Romualdez would rather spend his tax-funded time making epal before the cameras, perhaps he should go the whole nine yards and do it properly. Show Filipinos he can afford food and enjoy a decent standard of living within the means a normal Filipino income allows. Otherwise, he should just go back to his office and do his job.",Politics
Duterte dynasty being progressively torn down by Marcos-Romualdez juggernaut!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/duterte-dynasty-being-progressively-torn-down-by-marcos-romualdez-juggernaut/,"In his piece today “A discomforting realization about democracy”, Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III ponders the “formerly unthinkable” — that given the way things have come down over the last few months that the administration of Philippine President Bongbong Marcos “represents the democratic center in our national life. And may do so, for the foreseeable future.”
Whether it’s the United States or the European Union, Japan, or Australia, the democratic verdict has been accepted and what President Marcos has done is bring back the Philippines to that place in the world order in which it formerly, respectably, and credibly, existed: as a supporter of democracy, and the cooperation, stability, and security that comes from accepting international law and human rights.
The Marcoses as the center in Philippine politics? All because of what he has done so far? I don’t think so. Marcos is just out for the validation of the Western powers. It’s all about reestablishing the brand or the name, depending on how you look at it. At the same time, their comeback couldn’t have come at a better time. The Opposition is dead. There is no credible opposition anymore because of the Yellowidiots’ inability to admit their mistakes and adjust accordingly. The oligarchs have also evolved towards forming corporate political parties, such as that of former Senate President Manny Villar and ICTSI chairman Enrique Razon. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) is following in this path only because Danding Cojuangco is dead and Ramon Ang isn’t a politician.
But think of the events of the past month. Vice President Inday Sara Duterte has been blown out of the water. Former President Rodrigo “Digong”  Duterte (PRRD) has been threatened with the International Criminal Court (ICC). Amnesty for rebels has been declared again. Peace talks with the almost dead Reds are on again.
This early, Marcos is already busy building his legacy as leader and statesman. The Marcos-Romualdez (House Speaker Martin Romualdez specifically comprising the latter) combine have cut down the Dutertes to size. In their mind, they weren’t a real match because of their provenance.  The Dutertes don’t have any. The Marcoses are part of the elite and have generational wealth.
What prodded Digong to diss Marcos after he declared he was running was the late President Feedinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos’s betrayal of his father in the 1967 congressional election in Davao. Marcos Sr. picked Alejandro Almendras over Vicente Duterte. The Dutertes present the last credible threat to the Marcoses politically so they had to be eliminated as rivals. What better way than to embrace their enemies in a tactical alliance? The Yellowidiots and the Reds are rejoicing now!
The only hope the Dutertes have is the people. At this point, there are only two options; retreat and surrender or fight it out and see how much public support they still have. There is no such thing as ideology in Philippine politics. Only permanent interests. It can be said though that among the post-Marcos presidents, only PRRD had the best interest of the Filipino at heart.",Politics
Commies and Yellowtards swallow their ideologies along with their pride,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/commies-and-yellowtards-swallow-their-ideologies-along-with-their-pride/,"“Thought leaders” of the  Yellowtard-Communist Axis find themselves in a conundrum seeing (or, perhaps, them merely asserting) that the administration of Bongbong Marcos is “undoing” what former President Rodrigo Duterte did during the previous administration. Both the Yellowtards and the commies now find the need to tone down their formerly shrill Marital Law Crybaby rhetoric and get in bed with the son of the man they formerly regarded as The Great Satan.
It is the usual Lesser Evil Politics that Filipinos are renowned for. Yellowtards and commies who fancy themselves the “good guys” in their so-called “fight” against “tyranny” now have to backpedal their inconsistent and intellectually-dishonest ideologies in order to sign their respective deals with the devil. While one considers that the Yellowtards have just Martial Law Crybabyism to let go of, one must pity the Reds. They have that and their “anti-imperialism” (ergo, anti-Americanism) to swallow along with their pride.
Perhaps there was a masterstroke in the Marcos administration’s recent initiative to grant “amnesty” to commie elements. To add insult to the injury of having to dismantle a key pillar of their belief system, these parasites now owe an utang na loob (debt of gratitude) to their former archenemy. Not that we should hold our breath. Commies are among the most duplicitous people and will stab in the back any party in any negotiating table they sit in the minute they find the chance.
All this, of course, is par for the course in traditional Philippine politics. The key thing to understand here is that many of the politicos (and their cadres of “influencers” and “bloggers”) we see jostling for a foot in the King’s Court are traditionals — a bit removed from the place in the hierarchy of needs to which ordinary Filipino voters have evolved to. Insiders see the place they take on the “sides” of their respective cult leaders as the all-important “fight” of their small lives. Outsiders, on the other hand, armed with their valuable outsiders’ perspectives only see a bunch of bickering buffoons.
The trouble with periods in between elections is that there is a lack of hard data on which of these sides are communicating effectively and, therefore, resonating powerfully with the Filipino people. Lacking data, foolish sentiment and obsolete loyalties prevail in the small minds of the politically-passionate. The fact is, politics becomes less of a concern for ordinary Filipinos in between elections and, as such, collectively emit less data on their sentiments. Not surprisingly, we now see politicians and their cult followers slugging it out among themselves in the dark. The only casualties in their little “fights” are their principles.",Politics
The trouble with the Dutertes are the Dutertards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/the-trouble-with-the-dutertes-are-the-dutertards/,"The writing is on the wall. Brand Duterte is a sinking ship and it is taking down with it the cadre of cling-ons that hitched a ride on it during the previous term of former President Rodrigo Duterte. The Dutertes, if we recall, were disadvantaged from the very beginning. The former president was a “dark horse” candidate back in the campaign lead up to 2016 — a candidate from the Philippines’ deep south up against the Establishment politicos of Imperial Manila.
It helped Duterte at the time that the incumbent Philippine president then was the late Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. Aquino, we recall, was a bumbling president who, over the course of his presidency, single-handedly squandered the vast political capital of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis which peaked when he was catapulted to power by the death of his mother, former President Cory Aquino in 2009. Duterte, at the time, presented an alternative to the traditional inbred oligarchy that ruled the Philippines since 1946 and a strong case for “change” that won him the presidency.
Duterte, of course, remains a popular figure and his daughter, current Vice President Inday Sara Duterte who herself enjoys a strong cult following, basks under the halo her father casts upon their joint “die hard” fan base. Unfortunately for the Dutertes, popularity matters less in between elections, specially at a time when street parliamentarianism had been rendered obsolete by overuse. In between elections, institutional power wins. This is the sort of power we see today being wielded against the Dutertes — political and financial mutual favours sealed by oligarchs on golf courses in Manila’s chi chi residential enclaves translating to “court rulings” favourable to certain people, inquiries “in aid of legislation” turning into kangaroo courts, and wholesale re-pivots in foreign policy.
This all should come as no surprise to the Dutertes themselves. They, after all, played the same game back when they were the powers-that-be. Filipinos have a term for that reality that they use to dismiss the shrill whining we now hear about said reality — pana-panahon lang yan (“peoples’ times under the sun come and go”).
The trouble with Brand Duterte is that it is propped up by mediocre “bloggers” and “influencers”, unstatesman-like political allies, and crooked media outlets. To be fair the same could be said of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis; what with the droning repetitive way with which they spin recycled slogans around their obsolete ideologies and elevate idiots like Jover Laurio to sainthood with the blessings of no less than the Ateneo de Manila University. The Dutertes, for their part, kept clowns like Bong Go, Senator Bato dela Rosa, and Pastor Apollo Quiboloy in their court and, while they collectively pushed a consistent messaging around toughness on criminals and terrorists and improved solidarity with the Philippines’ peers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that resonated (and continues to do so today) with ordinary Filipinos, it didn’t help that these people were utter incompetents in the PR game.
In short, the game was played by both the Dutertes and the Yellowtard-Communist Axis and is now being played — so far very well — by what many now see to be the consolidating Marcos-Romualdez political camp of President Bongbong Marcos. People interpret the slide of the Dutertes back “down under” from where they came from as one of a deliberate demolition by today’s powers-that-be. The reality is likely to be less dramatic. The Dutertes are mere collateral damage in what is really just traditional jostling for position and access to resources that is par for the course in Philippine politics.
For the Dutertards, key to their survival (or, at least, ability to remain in the game) is to play well. Try the dramatics, try the antics, try the courts, and try the media, sure. Key, however, is in taking stock of the results of those tactics, analysing the data and, off those, re-evaluating strategy continuously. Key for them winning this round is to be not like the Yellowtards and their commie pals who failed to analyse the data, failed to re-evaluate their trajectory, failed to evolve, and, as a result, lost an entire nation.",Politics
Marcos Loyalists like @TheaDTan continue to pretend there is no organised demolition campaign against the Dutertes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/marcos-loyalists-like-theadtan-continue-to-pretend-there-is-no-organised-demolition-campaign-against-the-dutertes/,"Diplomats normally pursue peaceful solutions and don’t agitate for war. Does  House Speaker Martin Romualdez really want a shooting war to breakout between the US and China over the Philippines? The Marcos Loyalists praise President Bongbong Marcos for his hardline stance on Philippine sovereignty over the so-called disputed areas when this is clearly not the case even if we go by the arbitral tribunal ruling. The Scarborough Shoal was lost because of Uncle Sam through the deal it brokered with China and arbitral tribunal ruling. It also wasn’t included in any of the treaties signed by the United States when the Philippines was still its colony.
So now we have Marcos propagandists calling out the Vice-President to issue a statement with the implication that her silence is tantamount to treason.
Isn’t this a narrow view of a complicated issue? I’m not a stalker or a troll unlike someone who used to listen in quietly when I used to go on Spaces on a regular basis. Now I find out the information I shared was used by said someone for their own benefit later on. If this isn’t intellectual thievery then I don’t know what is. Let’s cut the crap about there not being any organized campaign against the Dutertes because obviously there is. As I keep on repeating, the optics are excellent in the Marcos administration but where is the substance?
For the record, I have also called out the Vice-President for her errors of omission, such as referring to the NPA as the national people’s army in her statement against the resumption of peace talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF. There is also the matter of her obviously reading from the teleprompter which Marcos also does. It’s funny how a propagandist goes to the extent of calling out “Duterte’s trolls'” inability to “elucidate” and understand the “nuances” of her arguments. Pray tell, how can a troll have intellectual depth to begin with? It’s not like any of the loyalist propagandists possess the same.
It’s best that we just stick to the facts. As I’ve pointed out in a separate  post, it was former President Rodrigo Duterte who paved Marcos’s path to the presidency. Would Marcos have won by a landslide without a Duterte by his side? This article in a German publication reinforces the claim that victory by “the Marcos, Duterte, Macapagal-Arroyo, and Estrada families, along with their allies” was achieved through a disinformation campaign targeted at the masses.
…the [2022] elections turned into an asymmetric battle dominated by a well-funded machinery of mostly unseen non-traditional actors, but directed by the usual suspects, working since 2015 using new, tech-based and data-driven tools that systematically supplied wholesale disinformation, manipulated public opinion, and quietly perverted everyday narratives accessible to most Filipinos. The disinformation, narratives, and messages of political micro-targeting were eventually refined and sharpened over the six years of the Duterte administration to make the political coalition led by the top families (Marcos, Duterte, Macapagal-Arroyo, and Estrada) the preferred choice of voters.
What it doesn’t take into account is the genuine dissatisfaction of a majority of Filipinos over the administration of the late former President Benigno Aquino III who ran the Yellow brand to the ground over his term of office from 2010 through 2016. The article claims that Marcos is just as “illiberal” as Duterte but lo and behold, he has basically fulfilled the campaign promises of his leftist-liberal opponent. The leadership of the leftist-militant groups don’t even dare mention his name on social media platforms over the enforcement of the final deadline for the public utility vehicles (PUV) modernization which would see the phase-out of the decrepit jeepneys that have been the bane of generations of Filipino commuters. These very same leftist-militant “activists” had long rallied behind the operators and drivers of these affronts to modern public transport.
The same is true with the Yellowidiots. The quote from Hitchens applies to those who are equally noisy but bereft of substance.
You may be successful at creating the illusion but in the end, the truth will always out eventually. Just look at what happened in Ukraine. If you want the Philippines to become the Asian equivalent, I just hope you won’t run and turn tail when the shooting begins.",Politics
Yellowtards and commies behind Marcos administration in seeking to crush Duterte brand,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/yellowtards-and-commies-behind-marcos-administration-in-seeking-the-crush-duterte-brand/,"How things have changed. But that’s the only constant in the world, change. I thought the victory of the UniTeam at the polls would finally put down the Yellowidiots once and for all and the country can finally move on from the divisiveness which began in 1986. Little did I know that this meant the return of the Yellowidiots from the dead.
In 2019, Drei Toledo and Mimi Fabe approached me to write a chapter in the book they were going to come out with about the disruptive innovations of the administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte. That became the title of the book. I ended up contributing two chapters. It sold out during its limited run. Today I get this sinking feeling that those who were cut down to size by Digong are willing to do anything just to get back at him and put him in his proper place. In less than two years, his enemies have come out of hiding because they know the time is right to get back at him because he’s just an ordinary citizen now.
Duterte failed to implement his succession plan because of his rift with his daughter, current Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, over his trusted aide. He did see the writing on the wall which is why he warned about what might become of the country if his warning wasn’t heeded. But Inday made her own decision and the rest is now history.
It seemed that not a long time ago, the greater majority of Filipinos supported the war on drugs. The first months of the Duterte administration marked the return of peace and order unlike during the Aquino administration when riding-in-tandem killings became a daily occurrence, drug abuse was rampant, and the crime index was high with robberies and rape left and right. Duterte pivoted foreign policy away from the US and instituted rapprochement with China. The Philippines ceased to be known as the American lapdog in the region. It was finally one with ASEAN and Duterte also made friends with Shinzo Abe despite his being on the same level with Xi Jin Ping.
Duterte increased the basic pay of the members of the AFP and PNP. He also continued with the modernization of the country’s defense organization. Duterte didn’t prepare for the time when he would revert back to being an ordinary citizen. He didn’t establish a national political dynasty. He didn’t leave office with a pabaon fund of secret holdings in large corporations nor did he run for office again in order to cloak himself with immunity. Now there is a well-organized effort to crush his political brand. It’s now up to him if he will take up the challenge again and fight or take his chances and see what his fate will be. He’s now down to the group of Senators who won because of his leading the campaign during the 2019 midterm. Senators Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa and Bong Go will remain loyal to him but Senators Francis Tolentino and Robin Padilla aren’t as close to him. He still has the support of Imee Marcos and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and this may be enough to protect him from his enemies.
As a martial law baby, I grew up watching President Feedinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos Senior on television and saw him and then First Lady Imelda in the flesh as they went in and out of Malacañan because I was born and raised in Concepcion Aguila in San Miguel, Manila. Marcos Sr. and Duterte are the two best presidents the country ever had, faults and all. Marcos’ downfall was due to the Iron Butterfly but if it weren’t for her, we wouldn’t have all the specialty hospitals in Metro Manila, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) complex and the iconic Philippine International Convention Center (PICC). Current President Bongbong Marcos (BBM) should’ve learned his lesson about the Americans with the ignominious departure his family was subject to in 1986. But as it appears now, that experience didn’t teach him anything about setting the country on the right path and not getting left behind any further by its regional neighbors.
It’s particularly disconcerting to see the Yellowidiots and the Reds willing to side with Marcos to put Duterte down. I just hope that Marcos shares the same debt of gratitude and loyalty that his sister has in acknowledging the large role Duterte played in ensuring their return to power.",Politics
VP Inday Sara Made Enemies of Senators and Congressmen Over Confidential Funds,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/vp-inday-sara-made-enemies-of-senators-and-congressmen-over-confidential-funds/,"If only Vice President Inday Sara Duterte didn’t give in to getting piqued over the incessant protestations over her proposed P650 million confidential funds, she would probably have not alienated nearly all our country’s senators and congressmen.
But alas, she had to say that, “Those who are against confidential funds are against peace. Those who are against peace are enemies of the nation.”
Reduced to its simplest sense, she practically accused as terrorists all senators and congressmen opposed to her proposed confidential funds.
Those words are going to come back and bite her when 2028 comes.
This is notwithstanding the possible adverse decision by the Supreme Court on the petition to declare her use of P125 million of confidential funds as unconstitutional, possibly paving the way for her impeachment.
After all, who is going to want to side with a candidate who not only branded them as terrorists but also has impeachment hanging over her head?
Running for president in 2028 for VP Inday Sara is definitely going to be exponentially more difficult without the support of congressmen and a senators in their respective bailiwicks. Typically, national candidates depend on their allies in local government not only for logistics and manpower but also benefit from their voter base.
An immensely popular national candidate without strong allies in local government typically loses to a candidate that has. Popularity among the masses doesn’t assure victory at all because what matters on election day is for a national candidate’s voters to show up and this can only be assured — at least in part — by the machinery of local candidates.
Even granting that Vice President Sara Duterte could keep her mainland Chinese funders, it would be unlikely that they’d continue supporting her with funds at the level that they’re said to have supported her candidacy for Vice President in 2022. (In all likelihood, they might even more likely support the candidacy of their secret allie, former Senator Antonio Trillanes.)
Over all, the key takeaway here is that Insulting potential political allies is a bad idea.
Here are a few reasons why:
Firstly, it can damage relationships before they even have a chance to develop. If you insult someone, they are unlikely to want to work with you or support your cause.
Secondly, insulting people can harm your reputation. If you are known for being rude or disrespectful, people are less likely to want to work with you or support your cause.
Thirdly, insulting people can create unnecessary conflict and tension. Politics is already a contentious and divisive field, and insults only make things worse.
By treating potential allies with respect and civility, you can help to reduce conflict and promote cooperation.

Leila De Lima is the new martyr-saint of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/leila-de-lima-is-the-new-martyr-saint-of-the-yellowtard-communist-axis/,"“Maintenance cost for a now defunct alliance…” These are the words used by noted Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III in his latest piece to regard the detention of former Senator Leila De Lima as the “cost” of the political alliance of the Marcoses, Dutertes and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the leadup to the massive electoral defeat of the Yellowtards in the 2022 national elections.
Of this detention, MLQ3 writes…
The time stolen from De Lima was stolen from the Filipino people, too. It deprived not only those who voted for her, but the entire national constituency that elects senator, of representation. It likely robbed her of a second term, as well, as she took a reputational hit from the attacks mounted by former president Rodrigo Duterte and his entire infrastructure.
Were the Filipinos who voted for De Lima in 2016 robbed as MLQ3 claims? Start with the facts. De Lima didn’t almost make it into the Senate in that election. The margin between her and then candidate and former chief of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Francis Tolentino was narrow enough for Tolentino to file allegations of electoral fraud against De Lima. This puts a bit of a reality check on the idea that De Lima was a leading opposition or personality at the time.
The more important unanswered question, however, is this: Did De Lima have enough evidence against former President Rodrigo Duterte on her charges of human rights offenses? If she did, why didn’t she file a case against him when she was still chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)? It was quite obvious that De Lima was tasked with the demolition job on the then president, hitting the ground running just as soon as the Senate began sessions after her proclamation. The narrative was from an old playbook which was used to oust former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2000. They thought it would work against Duterte, another plurality president, since they successfully applied this approach against Erap, who swept De Venecia in 1998.
If De Lima was abandoned by her peers, then that’s just how politics is in this country as it is Duterte’s turn to be marginalized. Filipinos have notoriously short memories seeing how there are only few who mention the preponderance of even circumstantial evidence against De Lima which showed her partying  with notorious drug lords inside the Bilibid compound and her admission of her frailties by indulging in an affair with her driver who was married which, going by the revised penal code, is an act of adultery punishable not only by the penal provision but also disbarment for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar. Is she not guilty of this act as well even with her admission?
The Yellowidiots have always been practitioners of the double standard. De Lima is now being “martyrized” like the late former senator and “national hero”  Ninoy Aquino before her. She’s also being sanctified like former President Cory Aquino. The other question is, did her being granted bail come with a quid pro quo from the Americans and Europeans who have been clamoring for her release from “unjust” detention? Did the Marcos administration give in to the wishes of the “rules-based international order” in exchange for its continuing validation as a friend, partner and ally?",Politics
Makapili or Makabayan Part 2: The lies that brought the US military back to the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/makapili-or-makabayan-part-2-the-lies-that-brought-the-us-military-back-to-the-philippines/,"Philippine President Bongbong Marcos has adopted a pro-America foreign policy that was reportedly at the insistence of his cousin, Philippine Ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez. This has resulted in Marcos being received warmly in the US after he allowed American access to additional bases under the Enhanced Cooperation Defense Agreement (EDCA), all under the guise of civil and humanitarian assistance.
The US militarization of the Philippines, including expanding military joint exercises in contentious areas has only increased tensions in the disputed territories in the South China Sea, proving once again the “deterrence” that Babe Romualdez, Senators Risa Hontiveros and Juan Miguel Zubiri, and former Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, among others, used to justify more US military presence in the Philippine was a big lie to the public.
President Marcos initially promised the continuation of an independent foreign policy following his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte but, apparently it seems, that was also just lip service.
How many times did America betray the Filipino people?
If the US is really on the Philippines’ side, why is the US not escorting the Philippine Coast Guard in resupplying the WW2-rusting BRP Sierra Madre, or better yet replace it with a new one? Countless Filipinos died in Marawi, Mamasapano, and other conflict areas even with reported US military presence. Why did the US betray the Philippines’ claim to Sabah? If the said EDCA bases are to support Philippine interests, why are the US military bases surrounding Taiwan, instead of Sabah or the West Philippine Sea or in typhoon-prone areas like the Visayas region?
Any thinking person can see that these EDCA bases make the Philippines the target of America’s enemies, and only serve America’s agenda in containing and provoking China using Taiwan.
Are our politicians aware that over 500,000 people have died in the Ukraine-Russia conflict — a war instigated by the US and NATO — in less than two years? Or that millions have died in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and the national wealth of these countries taken over by US companies, after the US promised to “help” those countries.
Hijacking the President’s Powers
Like the “red scare” of McCarthyism of the US in the 1950s, Jonathan Malaya of the Philippines’ National Security Council (NSC), without any evidence, claims that there are Chinese operatives who are working with media personalities who are working with the Chinese in swaying public opinion in China’s favor. Then he would later say that the NSC is not participating in any witch hunt. Ironically Malaya had no qualms over Duterte’s China policy when he was a former undersecretary at the Department of Interior and Local Government. He also did not mention that Rappler, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), and Vera Files received millions from the CIA-linked National Endowment for Democracy (NED).
Jay Tarriela, spokesperson of Philippine Coast Guard, even called Filipinos who don’t blindly support the Marcos government’s policy in the West Philippine Sea as “unpatriotic” and “traitors”. He would later claim his statement was personal belying the fact that he makes the statement donned on his uniform in public platforms, perhaps a skill he learned from the time he was caught cheating in the Philippine Military Academy and even had the gall to sue the august institution.
Ambassador Romualdez, who has repeatedly praised Tarriela, has single-handedly hijacked the Constitutionally-mandated powers of the President to be the sole architect of Philippine Foreign Policy. Recall that Romualdez had the gall to agree with the US for the Philippines to accept 50,000 Afghans with the knowledge of President Marcos, whom Senator Imee had exposed and raised alarm over possible “American spies” who fled their Taliban-led country.
Marcos Pro-America Administration Isolating the Philippines in Region
What is incomprehensible now is the hate and vitriol being pushed against China when it has done nothing against the Philippine mainland and the Filipino people save for the “encounters” in the disputed areas in the South China Sea. China’s change in stance in the South China is a logical reaction to Marcos allowing the US to convert the Philippines into an American military aircraft carrier with missiles pointed at China.
At the recent Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Jakarta, Marcos pushed for the adoption of a resolution for a common stand to be taken by ASEAN member countries on the South China Sea disputes but it wasn’t adopted. There was no common statement against China and once again, the Philippines stood alone, exposed, as the American proxy in the region and within ASEAN.",Politics
Leila De Lima threatens to sue former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Will she succeed?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/leila-de-lima-threatens-to-sue-former-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte-will-she-succeed/,"Former Senator Leila De Lima, newly released on bail and now surrounded by Yellowtards, priests, and “journalists” is locked and loaded. “It’s reckoning time,” she reportedly crows — a battle cry made today’s top headline by no less than the Inquirer.
But of course, right?
But how much credibility as a practitioner of law does De Lima wield? This is someone, after all who seems to bow more to a foreign “court” than to the authority of the Supreme Court of her own country. This is evident in how, even today, she makes the International Criminal Court (ICC) a pillar of her threats against former President Rodrigo Duterte.
She also scoffed at the former president’s remarks against her after she voiced her support for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC).
ICC is investigating the previous administration’s campaign against illegal drugs.
Duterte previously said de Lima can “go together” with ICC, as he tossed the matter aside.
In reaction, de Lima asked, “Am I a human rights violator? Am I a killer, let alone a mass murderer?”
“Siguro ang ibig sabihin lang niyang ‘magsama-sama’ ay gusto lang niyang may makasama siya in that lonely cell at ICC,” she said in jest.
(Maybe what he means by ‘go together’ is that he wants someone to go with him in that lonely cell at ICC.)
Indeed, back in 2019, De Lima exhibited behaviour unbecoming of an officer of the judiciary which could even be regarded as grounds for disbarment. De Lima at the time had counted on an initiative being mounted by the US government back then to coerce the Philippines into releasing her from detention by banning Filipinos seen to be instrumental in her detention.
Think about it for a moment. The US is implementing a measure to ban Philippine government officials on the basis of someone’s opinion that they had “persecuted” Philippine Senator Leila De Lima. This is a position taken regardless of what any Filipino court has so far ruled. It just shows how, to Americans, the Philippines still remains a quaint little colonial outpost.
The Philippines’ Supreme Court at the time upheld a June 2018 ruling on De Lima’s arrest and detention on drug charges…
The high court denied “with finality” De Lima’s motion for reconsideration and said it would no longer entertain future pleadings or motions.
“…No substantial arguments were presented to warrant the reversal of the questioned decision,” the court said in a notice.
The Yellowtard-Communist Axis that make up much of the Philippines’ so-called “Opposition” nonetheless continue to make the ICC intervention into domestic affairs a pillar of their ideology. Old habits die hard and the Philippines today remains a laughingstock of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — the only country in the region that lacks an indigenous conviction robust enough to get over a historic fixation on its “victimisation” by former colonial masters. Today its “thought leaders” remain locked in quaint “debate” over which global power to cling to — United States or China — as camps use local politicians as proxies to organise themselves into polar cults of personality and loyalty to the day’s global hegemons; the administration of current President Bongbong representing the influence of Uncle Sam and the Duterte clan representing that of the People’s Republic of China.
Where does the influence of an independent Philippines fit in this picture? Well, what exactly these “thought leaders” mean when they drop the term “independence” is the subject of yet another idiotic Filipino-style “debate”. So let’s not hold our breath waiting for an answer to that last question.",Politics
Marcos administration should keep above rabid politicking and focus on good governance,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/marcos-administration-should-keep-above-rabid-politicking-and-focus-on-good-governance/,"Here’s the thing. If House Speaker Martin Romualdez (SMR) isn’t interested in the presidency, then why has he been seen pointing at sacks of rice in a warehouse? The demolition job on Vice President Inday Sara Duterte continues with the Makabayan bloc continuing to follow through with their threat of impeachment. Yellowidiot lawyers filed a case at the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the transfer of funds from the Office of the President to the Office of the Vice-President. Isn’t this laying the predicate?
In the meantime, the Yellowidiots and the Reds are focused on taking down the Dutertes and those closest to them such as Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa. The moves in the House of Representatives have triggered the exodus from PDP-Laban to the  Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP) and Lakas-CMD parties simply because our honorable legislators know that’s where the monies are now.
2025 will be the litmus test for the Duterte brand. It will determine which camp will stand out going into 2028. Inday will not break from the president but current President Bongbong Marcos will find himself being questioned by the public for not making any statement asking those in his camp to stand down from politicking. The moronic loyalists who are accusing the Duterte camp of destabilization plots and coup attempts are stupid because the situation today isn’t the same as the time when the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) was organized with then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile’s blessing.
The president’s pivot to the United States is his way of ensuring he stays in power. That’s his position because he craves Western validation. If the US Democratic candidate loses in the 2024 election, American foreign policy will shift again and this will have an impact on our own 2025 midterm.
The Marcos loyalists will keep the faith but the same can’t be said for Filipinos who aren’t loyalists. This is why the Marcos administration has to improve in governance. It’s can’t be all propaganda on its part.",Politics
Will We See Diabolic Digong Behind Bars for Issuing Grave Threats?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/will-we-see-diabolic-digong-behind-bars-for-issuing-grave-threats/,"If it were up to former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, yes.
In an appearance on SMNI, Duterte said, ““Magpakulong na lang ako. Kasi wala naman akong… Ino-opress ako ni France,”
He said this in response to ACT Party List Congresswoman France Castro filing a complaint of grave threats against the former president at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court.
Castro, a congresswoman from the leftist party, filed a lawsuit against Duterte, cited Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code and Section 6 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. This action was taken in response to Duterte’s threat to make her the “first target” of Vice President Sara Duterte’s confidential intelligence fund.
Throughout his tenure as president, Duterte frequently issued explicit threats of death and imprisonment towards individuals. Notably, he singled out former senator Leila De Lima, accusing her of involvement in the illegal drug trade in 2016, leading to her arrest in 2017.
Likewise, in his regular addresses during the COVID-19 pandemic, he made warnings of potential arrest for those who refused vaccination, drawing rebukes from the Commission on Human Rights and numerous groups and organizations.
With the conclusion of his presidential immunity, Duterte now faces potential charges under Philippine law, in addition to the impending International Criminal Court prosecution for alleged human rights violations during the drug war.
Despite the loss of immunity, Duterte persists in making pointed remarks on various issues and critics, often during programs such as SMNI, at times echoing a pro-Beijing narrative that advocates for avoiding conflict with China.
Following the subpoena issued against Duterte, he is obligated to appear at the office of the city prosecutor in Quezon City on December 4 and 11.
Castro challenged Duterte to face her during the preliminary investigation saying, “I was hoping that former Pres. Rodrigo Duterte will see sense and participate in the preliminary investigation on December 4 and 11. But his initial reaction as well as his hubris and fear to face his victims indicate otherwise.”
Lawyer Harry Roque, the former President’s spokesman, seems to have responded to Castro saying, “Now that there’s a pending case at the office of the Philippine prosecutor, of course, he will face his accusers and prove that he didn’t violate any of our existing laws.”
But Roque did not specify whether Duterte will personally face the prosecutors or if a lawyer will represent him.
Thinking about it, would the people waging war on former President Duterte and his daughter Vice President Inday Sara Duterte really want to have them seen behind bars? Wouldn’t that martyrize them and possibly galvanize their followers to actions against the current administration?
Then again, given the repugnant and vile tactics employed by the Dutertes and their followers over six years, I don’t see their cries of injustice having the same appeals as that of Ninoy, Cory, or even Erap.
Still yet, consider also that the Philippines economic base — at least on the level of imports/exports — is split between the US and China.
We could see political forces dividing between a US backed, communist siding group, mostly located in Luzon as well as parts of the Visayas and a China backed, anti-communist siding group, mostly located in parts of Mindanao.
Civil war? Possibly, if things get bad enough.

Hello everyone, my name is Oman and I am a Middle Eastern man who has been fortunate enough to receive my education in the United Kingdom.
I am excited to share my political insights on the Philippines, a country that has been my home for the past thirty years.
Having grown up in the Middle East, I was initially drawn to the Philippines for its vibrant culture, warm hospitality, and breathtaking landscapes. Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for this beautiful nation and its people, which has fueled my desire to understand and contribute to its political landscape.

"On its “Independence Day”, the Philippines remains a sad and CONFUSED colony",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/on-its-independence-day-the-philippines-remains-a-sad-and-confused-colony/,"Today, the 12th of June, is the Philippines’ imagined “Independence Day” — the day when she unilaterally declared herself “independent” of her Spanish colonial master. That was not to be for long as history would go on to reveal. Way above Filipinos’ pointed heads as their “revolutionaries” patted themselves on their backs, Spain and the United States had already been negotiating the handing over of the little colony to the latter for a tidy sum of $20 million.
It remains debatable to this day whether the Philippines actually did become an independent state half a century later on the 4th July 1946 (the Philippines’ recognised independence day). Consider that for a moment and then take stock of what is happening in the Philippines today. Filipinos find themselves caught in a catfight between two dominant partisan camps today — the Dutertards loyal to former President Rodrigo Duterte and the Marcostards who are loyal to current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The object of the spat? None other than which contemporary hegemon to latch on to.
On the right corner of the ring are the Dutertards and their continued attachment to the infamous (depending on who you ask) “pivot to China” of their cult leader. On the left corner are the Marcostards — this time joined by, well, leftist elements — who find warm fuzzy comfort in Uncle Sam’s familiar embrace. This quaint political squabble between incumbent and “Opposition” exhibits a microcosm of the intellectual bankruptcy that is the Philippines’ national “debate”.
Glaringly absent in this “debate” is a set of indigenous principles upon which can be put up as stable reference for what it means to be an independent Philippine Nation. This is because these “debates” are framed by nothing more than personal loyalties and, now, two flavours of colonial mentality.
The most disturbing aspect of this bipolar partisanism can be seen on the Left Corner — an emerging Axis of Intellectual Dishonesty that sees the “liberal” Yellowtards and extremist communists in bed with their historical arch-enemy: the “evil” heir to the Marcos Dynasty no less. The coagulation of this Axis affirms the colonial and financial power Uncle Sam continues to exert on Imperial Manila’s traditional oligarchy. The Philippines’ learning-impoverished population and citizenry of lazy thinkers provides fertile ground for a battle of hegemons’ ideologies and global agendas.
The Noted One himself observes in a recent Inquirer piece using, as context, the ongoing “investigation” into the ghostly background and personal circumstances of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo who managed to deftly navigate the Philippines’ convoluted bureaucracy to secure local political power despite her sketchy national origins…
Investigations so far have been racist in their lazy assumptions and breezy unwillingness to take into account the messy state of the documentation of many Filipinos, the different subgroups among Chinese Filipinos, and differences between Pogos’ and Beijing’s efforts to influence officialdom.
In short, left to politicians’ devices, investigations into critical issues and execution of essential imperatives are no more than means for these politicians to fulfill media exposure agendas or, worse, used as smokescreens to mask or distract the public from more confronting core truths about how things came to be. No surprise then that expensive and disruptive initiatives like these devolve into nothing more than public circuses that deliver no results.
Here is where we circle back to the old imperial dynamic — that of the hands global powers-that-be play in stirring up unimportant frenzies in societies populated by lazy thinkers and comprehension-challenged people. Colonial powers do what they do because they can. It’s all business and nothing personal — a fact that makes the immense emotional investment Filipino partisans and “activists” sink into their personal cult followings even sadder.",Politics
False “patriots” are fomenting sinophobia in the Philippines and turning Filipinos into racists,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/false-patriots-are-fomenting-sinophobia-in-the-philippines-and-turning-filipinos-into-racists/,"Who’s sinophobic? Or rather, who’s fanning sinophobia in the country? It’s not the average Pinoy but overzealous nuts in the country’s government. You have the now famous coast guard commodore who infringes on the authority of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the National Security Council (NSC), combined. Then there are the leftist-liberals who don’t even bother to read about the underlying issues of the disputed areas in the South China Sea like how distance isn’t justification for jurisdiction or sovereignty.
It’s ironic that those who present the rational arguments are labeled as traitors. The false patriots take pride in their stupidity. You wonder if they will be fighting against those whom they’ve labeled as the enemy if it comes to war. The ultimate act of treason is reserved for the architect of foreign policy. Why? Because he puts the country and its citizens in harm’s way. What makes it worse is our siding with one of the principal actors in the conflict, who’s only protecting its hegemonic interest in the region.
Randy David admires Senator Risa Hontiveros for not playing the race card against Bamban mayor Alice Guo in his Inquirer column today “Philippine politics and Sinophobia”…
Seeing how Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who leads the Senate hearings on human trafficking and the Pogos, is careful to prevent the mayor’s ethnicity (rather than citizenship) from becoming the focus, I realized how easy it is for a less conscientious politician to turn the entire affair into a racist lynching mob. I’m afraid social media has failed to echo Risa’s restraint. The memes that have come out parodying Guo’s evasiveness have tended to reinforce a latent anti-Chinese sentiment that is so prevalent among many Filipinos.
What he doesn’t bring up is how Hontiveros is doing it indirectly. The same is true with one other Senator, who’s a Chinoy himself. You have to ask what law did Guo violate when it comes to her citizenship?
Definitely there is an irregularity in the operations of a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) in her municipality. It’s also worth mentioning that China itself has long been requesting the cooperation of the government in putting an end to the operations of POGOs in the country. This has been accomplished in Cambodia. But not in the Philippines. Why not? Put it simply, some of our government officials are on the take. There is also a strong lobby for the POGOs. If an earnest effort is made to investigate, why limit it to Guo? Why not include the pioneer Kim Wong, who bought Island Cove and turned it into one large POGO complex? The only difference is Wong is better connected than Guo. He enjoys the protection of high-ranking government officials.
The other point which David doesn’t mention is the eventual goal of the administration and the opposition is to pin the POGOs on former President Rodrigo Duterte. This is in addition to the Pharmally scandal. The reason is because the International Criminal Court (ICC) is no longer an option after Uncle Sam trained its guns on it for threatening to arrest Netanyahu and his ilk for the genocide in Gaza. Our senators have turned their chamber into a platform for grandstanding. What they should be focused on is legislation. Not investigation.",Politics
Why Filipinos are More Enamored with America than with China,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/why-filipinos-are-more-enamored-with-america-than-with-china/,"It was reported that the Chinese Embassy in Manila has accused the United States (US) of stoking tensions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). Chinese Embassy officials further claimed that the US is doing this to advance its own geopolitical interest in the region. Of course, right on cue, Duterte sycophants, who are likened to a bunch of Beijing Kool-Aid drinkers, have marched to the drumbeat of the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo. So many articles and blogs are being disseminated by these Duterte worshippers that even Stevie Wonder could see their effort in shifting the narrative from Chinese aggression and encroachment of our territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the “White American bad boys promoting their self-interest at Filipino expense” from a mile away. Such nonsense idea that the whole conflict is merely about America’s “Proxy War” against China seems so glaringly obvious to favor the Chinese position (besides being factually and historically wrong). For a while I thought these Duterte worshippers were just being useful idiots. Now I realize that they are just plain idiots. However, despite going on overdrive with their pro-China messaging, Filipinos still trust the US the most when it comes to the WPS issue, among other things. China, on the other hand, is dead last when it comes to being trusted by Filipinos. Where might this awe of America over China be coming from despite America having lost to China when it comes to military and economic strength, as Davao blowhard, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (FPRRD) said?
I am not going to repeat my critique of the Duterte sycophants’ claptrap. I believe that I have already pointed out many flaws in their propaganda and the intellectual bankruptcy of the Chinese Brown-nosing Policy that their fentanyl-dosed deity seems to be championing. What I would like to dwell on are probable reasons why Filipinos still have a higher regard for America compared to China. Afterall, data shows that the US has the highest number of emigrants from the Philippines while China’s numbers don’t even appear on the radar when it comes to places Filipinos choose to move to. If Americans are so evil and dumb as what the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers seem to be pontificating, why do Filipinos choose to pursue the American dream over the promise of Chinese luck and prosperity? Why do Filipinos still seem to trust gas station sushi more than China?
Don’t get me wrong, I do not intend to minimize China or its contribution to our country. Afterall, how else can I afford to buy a matching Louis Vuitton belt and a pair of loafers for five bucks? How else can our beloved FPRRD continue (pain-free) with his incoherent rants against President Bongbong Marcos (PBBM) and America without China’s role in making sure fentanyl supply is flowing like the Niagara Falls? So, shouldn’t China’s great contributions and values be looked at more favorably than those dumb knuckle-headed fascist “American Imperialists”? What makes America so great in the eyes of the Filipinos? Let’s assess these Yankee characteristics, in terms of military strength, economic status, (scientific) intelligence, and cultural impact, shall we?
Military
Throughout history there have been a few countries that have dominated the world in terms of military strength. There was Egypt, Rome, the Mongols, Spain, France, Britain, and others. Presently, America has the most powerful military in the world. What separates America, especially in recent history, is its magnanimity after defeating its enemies. American military greatness is not just evident in its firepower but also in terms of its use of power. Case in point, after defeating Nazi Germany and after levelling Japan, America helped rebuild those countries. After World War 2, America’s military force remained intact as it had the most battle-hardened navy the world has ever seen, it possessed sky darkening clouds of B-29 bombers, and it possessed alone (at that time) the atomic bomb and the will to use it. The world was still licking its wounds from the war in 1945 and America could have conquered any recovering country in the world back then had it been the same as any other military superpower throughout history. But what did America do with the once in a lifetime military advantage it had? America actually scrapped many of its naval ships, drove steel bars through the wings of their B29 bombers and began the largest demilitarization process in the history of the world. It also sent billions of 1940s dollars (through the Marshall Plan) to its former mortal enemies to get them back up on their feet. This isn’t just a one-off but actually a pattern. In 1991, the US military routed Iraq and drove them away from Kuwait, a country invaded by then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. America could have taken the oil but what did it do? America helped Kuwait put out the fires that Saddam Hussein caused and went back home. Throughout the decades after World War 2, America has only gone to war in response to aggression and not to conquer or subjugate other countries (even though it could have).  On occasion the United States intervened in other countries like Grenada or Haiti or Bosnia, but it never stayed to rule those countries. Now what about China’s history of invasion? Did any Duterte sycophants ever fact-check Chinese Communist Party spokesperson Mao Ning for her claim that China has never invaded any country? Yeah, not holding my breath on that one. If China cannot be trusted for its whitewashing of its blemished history in terms of military aggression and invasion, can we really blame the Filipinos for distrusting the Chinese when it comes to respecting our sovereignty and sovereign rights?
Economics
America, by far, remains the largest economy in the world with $28.8 trillion US dollars in GDP and $85,370 in GDP per capita. The runner-up, being China, has $18.5 trillion US dollars in GDP and $13,400 in GDP per capita. Interestingly enough, America has 332 million people compared to China’s population of 1.4 billion people. Since the world’s population is roughly 7.9 billion, it is interesting to point out that despite America only having around 4% of the world’s population compared to China having around 18% of the world’s population, America still produces more than 1.5 times the GDP of second place China even with just a little more than 23% of China’s population. Sure, things like Lebron Nike shoes or Apple iPhones may be manufactured in China but the ideas to create such money-making products still come from America. In fact, America has been on top of the innovation age in recent history. There have been about three waves of innovation ages since recorded history. There’s the agricultural age, the industrial age, and now we have the Information Age. During the 19th century America became the world’s largest grain exporter. During the late 1880s to the early 1900s, America became the world’s leading industrial nation. Now in the Information Age, America leads the world in terms of global information and communication technology market share. Sure, your laptop or your iPhone may very well be manufactured in China, but it is still America who keeps most of the money. It is worthwhile to point out that it actually is where ideas come from that is important and that many of the innovative ideas that propel the world’s economy primarily comes from America. Is there really anything new that comes from China or are they just good in stealing technology and reverse engineering American innovation? I’ll leave that question for my readers to discuss. What is important to point out is that America is not just economically massive, but it is economically nimble as well. Filipinos often migrate to other countries for a better life. Given America’s economic success borne out of its creativity, innovation, and economic nimbleness, is it any wonder why America’s grass looks greener than the shrubs of China’s Gobi Desert?
(Scientific) Intelligence
So how many times have we heard that Americans are dumb? Social media certainly is replete with Americans deserving of the Darwin Award. We have American kids being shown on TikTok being clueless on what year the War of 1812 was, which state the State of Utah is in, or how many states make up the USA. But is it really true that Americans are stupid, and the Chinese are far more intellectually superior? So let us do a comparison of scientific output and impact of the two countries. America still leads the world in terms of the volume of scientific publications produced. The metrics remain consistent in terms of citable documents, citations, and if we look at citations per document China does not even come close to America’s numbers. Why is this information significant? We have to realize that each year, scientists around the world write research papers and these papers produce scientific citations which is tantamount to a measure of how much groundbreaking science is being performed and produced. From 1996 to 2023, America had more than 515 million citations whereas China only had 145 million. This means that America had more than 3.5 times as many as the country that the Duterte supporters glorify. Is this just me being an America worshipper? Maybe that is the case if there were no empirical evidence basis to support my argument. Unfortunately for the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers, the numbers are there for everyone to see. America, by far, still trounces China in terms of scientific intelligence and America is beating China’s butt even with just around 4% of the world’s population and only 23% of China’s. Even just looking at inventions, America is the hub of all innovative inventions as most new technology was invented in America. Just by comparing the numbers of patent grants alone from 1980 to 2022, America has received a total of 6,184,653 while China received 4,570,636. Wow! It sure looks like a rude awakening for the Duterte worshippers to see that the country they worship is actually scientifically inferior to the “nation of idiots” they love to bash and vilify.
Cultural Impact
In terms of cultural impact let us look at the comparison of the highest grossing movies of all time. Data shows that America, by far, has produced the most in terms of highest grossing films. In fact, most of the movies (if not all) in the Top 50 were produced in America. The highest grossing movie of all time in China, “The Battle of Lake Changjin”, did not even appear on the World’s Top 50 list. In terms of music, America still holds the most number of albums sold in the world with Michael Jackson lording it over the musical world.
I am not, by any means, discounting the talents of people outside of America. There certainly are a lot of people with amazing talent all over the world and China certainly has no shortage of talent. However, the most successful products that came from amazing talents mostly came from American production. Jay Chou, is the all-time king of Chinese music record sales, yet his most successful album does not even appear on the world’s all-time top list. Empirically speaking, America still tops the list of countries that have the most impact in international popular culture. Remember, such cultural impact to the world with America having just around 4% of the world’s population compared to China’s 18%.
Look, let us not unnecessarily stretch this any further, although we could as it is so much fun bursting the Duterte pro-China bubble. The point is that it is not surprising why Filipinos generally still look more favorably towards Americans and America compared to the Chinese and China. Am I merely drinking the American Kool-Aid here? Perhaps. However, the numbers actually do show that America still seems to dominate China in aspects that are a lot worthy of awe and respect. We have not even touched on the current geopolitical turmoil between China and the Philippines yet. A study by Mark Gabriel Wagan Aguilar reveals that the primary drivers for Filipino distrust towards China point to the perceived Chinese threat, their displayed aggressiveness, and superiority complex. But that is for another day to discuss.",Politics
SO WHAT if the Duterte family is running for the Senate?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/so-what-if-the-duterte-family-is-running-for-the-senate/,"The Philippines’ brain-dead chattering classes are at it again. The “debate” this time is around a recent statement made by Vice President Sara Duterte that her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte and her two brothers, Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte and House Representative 1st District of Davao City Paolo Duterte, are planning to run for senators in the 2025 mid-term elections. Other related chatter involves the possibility she may resign as VP (she denies it) among other things following her resignation as Education Secretary.
So what?
Good question. Glaringly absent from the “debate” is what the presumptive Duterte legislators have up their sleeves in the way of some sort of legislative agenda. For both supporters and detractors alike, the intent seems evident — to ensure the dynasty remains in the game. The game whether one is a Marcos, Aquino, or Duterte is to stay out of jail as most Filipino politicians are guilty one way or another of one crime or another. In the Philippines, after all, behind great fortunes and great power lies at least one great crime. The Dutertes, despite having backed current President Bongbong Marcos’s bid for the presidency in the lead up to the 2022 elections, find themselves holding the short end of the stick today. The embattled dynasty is reeling from administrative pressure on all fronts — probes into their “war on drugs”, the newly-reencarnated Yellowtard “martyr” Leila De Lima, and the looming extradition of the family spiritual guru Apollo Quiboloy on charges of sexual misconduct to the United States among other things.
Indeed, much of the power infrastructure of the Duterte clan — Quiboloy’s media empire Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI), the relationship Communist China cosied into with Malacanang during the Duterte Administration, etc. — had been systematically pulled from under their feet since Marcos came to power. This is bolstered by the “ironclad” military alliance the Philippines now “enjoys” with her former colonial master engineered by Marcos. Political vendetta often favours those who control the administrative and bureaucratic tools and, today, the Marcoses and their accidental allies, the Yellowtards and commies, have their turn behind the sniper scope.
What all this chatter and jostling for position ultimately means to ordinary Filipinos is debatable. Time and again one or the other personality or sets of personalities from one or the other partisan camp warming seats in the Executive and Legislative branches of the Philippine Government had mattered little to Filipinos’ day-to-day lives. Public transport still sucks, cost of living remains crushing, intellectual development remains stunted, and overall ability to compete globally is declining if not already non-existent. The slide of the Philippines to irrelevance in southeast Asia encompasses several presidencies. So, really, one dynasty or the other seems to factor very little as far as Filipinos’ mid- to long-term fortunes are concerned.
All that can be observed and gleaned from what is currently being discussed and, specifically, this recent circus constitutes no more than an amusing distraction for Filipinos and something that props up the chattering classes’ sense of purpose. Until a legislative agenda underlies the Dutertes’ candidacies, the only real call to action for the thinking classes for now is to bring out the popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show.",Politics
Re-engineering Philippine US Relations in the Advent of Chinese Expansionism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/re-engineering-philippine-us-relations-in-the-advent-of-chinese-expansionism/,"Navigating the intricate web of Philippine interests amidst the volatile relationship between China and the United States presents a formidable challenge. The situation is further complicated by recurrent Chinese interference with Philippine resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre and escalating internal political rivalries fueled by the upcoming 2025 electoral campaign season.
Picture a scenario akin to playing multidimensional chess on a constantly shifting toroidal surface amidst the chaos of a free-for-all MMA fight. This analogy encapsulates the complexity and intensity of the situation.
For the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, this tumultuous reality fills his days in what would be the twilight years of most other man.
This may have given rise to the notion that he is a man in a precarious position and therefore, a potential weak link in the chain of steps the country needs should it decide to leverage its ties with the United States against China’s creeping maritime expansion.
It might have appeared this way to the Chinese during the term of former President Rodrigo R. Duterte. They may have perceived him either as a passive diplomat when it comes to leveraging America’s military power or a convenient “kill switch” that could be easily triggered in case Duterte’s erratic behavior led him to seek favor with the US.
Recent developments, however, tend to reveal Romualdez as an integral figure in the reengineering of the country’s military relations with the US to support a stronger, assertive stance with regards to the West Philippine Sea.
This makes Romualdez a high value target of China’s psychological war machinery and consequently, with the connivance of their Filipino sympathizers, China has unleashed sustained attacks on his reputation with the intent of removing him from office.
If they succeed, the repercussions would be devastating and enormously set back the country’s efforts to secure its claims on the West Philippine Sea.
His removal would strain relations between the Philippines and the US, signaling instability in the diplomatic relationship.
The US-Philippines security alliance could suffer immensely, leading to a dramatic decline in military cooperation and joint exercises, ultimately undermining regional security and stability.
It could be perceived as succumbing to Chinese pressure, tarnishing the reputation of the Philippine government and its ability to uphold sovereignty.
Despite the unrelenting attacks on his reputation, Romualdez has proven immovable as he stands firmly on the remarkable accomplishments that distinguished his career as Philippine ambassador to the US.
While operating under the guidance of President Bongbong Marcos and in alignment with the entire executive department, Ambassador Romualdez has been recognized for his pivotal role in reshaping military relations with the US in response to China’s expansionism.
Appointed in 2017, Romualdez has tirelessly navigated the intricate dynamics between maintaining sovereignty and fostering international partnerships. His diplomatic prowess has been instrumental in ushering in a new era of Philippine-U.S. relations characterized by mutual respect and strategic cooperation.
One of Romualdez’s notable achievements is the strengthening of the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the Philippines and the United States. He has engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. officials to ensure the defense commitments under the MDT are unequivocally upheld. This is particularly crucial given the escalating threat from China’s actions in the South China Sea. Romualdez’s efforts have led to high-profile visits from U.S. defense and state secretaries, solidifying the United States’ backing for Philippine sovereignty.
He has also been instrumental in expanding joint military exercises and defense equipment procurements to enhance the Philippines’ defense capabilities. Through initiatives like the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), the Philippines has gained access to cutting-edge military technology and training, essential for safeguarding its territorial waters.
Beyond military collaboration, Romualdez has championed economic partnership and development. Recognizing the pivotal role of economic stability, he has facilitated investments and trade opportunities beneficial to both nations. His initiatives have attracted U.S. companies to invest in various sectors, including technology, infrastructure, and renewable energy, making his engagements with cabinet officials pivotal in securing billions of dollars in business investments.
Balancing the delicate relationship between China and the U.S. is no small task. Ambassador Romualdez has adeptly managed these relations, ensuring that while the Philippines strengthens its defense ties with the U.S., it also maintains a pragmatic relationship with China. His diplomatic finesse reflects an understanding of the interconnected nature of global politics and the significance of a multifaceted foreign policy.
One of Romualdez’s key strategies has been to advocate for a rules-based order in the South China Sea, leveraging international legal frameworks like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). His diplomatic engagements underscore the importance of peaceful dispute resolution, upholding international law, and fostering regional stability.
As Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea unfolds, Ambassador Romualdez’s role in Philippine-U.S. relations becomes increasingly vital. His leadership exemplifies how skilled diplomacy can yield substantial benefits in terms of security, economic growth, and international standing.
The re-engineered multi-faceted relationship with the United States, under his guidance, stands as a testament to the power of strategic partnership in navigating the complexities of modern geopolitics.

I have closely observed the challenges, triumphs, and the resilience of the Filipino people, which have shaped my unique perspective on its political affairs.",Politics
Traditional values come back to bite woke “diversity” sentiment in the West as conservative parties score gains,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/traditional-values-come-back-to-bite-woke-diversity-sentiment-in-the-west-as-conservative-parties-score-gains/,"“Activist” groups and their mainstream media allies are branding recent political developments in Europe (and, to some extent, the rest of the world) as a shift to the “far right”. Earlier this year, analysts in Europe were already seeing “a significant chance the far right will, for the first time, be able to influence Europe’s policy agenda.” Eddie Wax wrote on Politico back then…
“We’re going to see a really significant shift to the right,” said Simon Hix, a professor of comparative politics at the European University Institute, referring to the June elections when 400 million people across the European Union are eligible to vote to send 720 representatives to Brussels.
Hix forecast the far-right Identity & Democracy (ID) grouping in the European Parliament, the sixth largest of seven, will gain 40 seats in June, meaning the group could have 98 lawmakers, vaulting into the third place currently occupied by the Liberals. It’s already home to the German extreme-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the French far-right National Rally (RN) party.
Then, if the current fifth largest grouping, the 67-member right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group — the home of Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) and Italy’s ruling Brothers of Italy — also grows by some 18 seats, as Hix predicts, it could become the fourth largest group in Parliament, surpassing both the Greens and the liberals.
Indeed, the rise of conservative parties in the two biggest countries in Europe is propelled primarily by growing anti-immigrant public sentiment. This meets head-on the pro-immigrant slant of the European Union (EU) which had, until recently, been welcoming to refugees and foreigners in general. Contrast these to the prosperous economies in the Far East — including Australia — which traditionally applied stronger controls over immigration and has remained largely consistent sustaining these to this day. Loosely related to this is a seeming growing fear among Europeans that their culture and traditions are under threat from increasingly assertive Islamic communities much of the members of which come from impoverished authoritarian and theocratic societies.
It is no secret, of course, that the EU is pro-business which goes on to explain why it is in favour of “diversity” and “inclusiveness”. After all, native Europeans don’t seem to be up to the job of procreating at replaceable levels and assuring businesses big enough markets to meet their growth targets and their shareholders’ capital gain goals over their strategic planning horizons. As such, hope in sustained “economic growth” lies in tapping new sources of consumers — first it was women, then teenagers, then immigrants and, more recently, homosexuals.
Granted societies gained a lot from this and evidently was absolutely enriched by the new ideas, values, and cultures these formerly “disadvantaged” cohorts contributed by being allowed into spaces formerly occupied exclusively by traditionally privileged cohorts. Suffice to say, the economic value they added was beyond debate when one considers that money remains the most objective measure of added value. Women, immigrants, and homosexuals, in short, added mightily to the labour force and the capital creation and building capacity of economies. Businesses are laughing all the way to the bank as even the very partisan camps — the Woke Left — who seek to temper and even destroy “capitalist ideology” back the “rights” and entitlement of these only-recently-strong contributors to national economies.
In the scheme of things, the social unrest and upheavals caused by all this “inclusiveness” is a small price to pay for nations committed to sustaining “economic growth” over the foreseeable future. All that was needed to mitigate said unrest is to continuously invent new ideologies and doctrines — the very recent context surrounding the words “diversity” and “inclusiveness” among them, as a matter of fact — to serve as channels for assimilation of outsiders and the different. Thus, the fluidisation of many formerly discrete, black-and-white (read, binary), and hardened categorisations such as ethnicity, gender, roles within organisations and social institutions, and even age. The blurring of lines and the reduction of the importance of categories assures capitalists more resilient markets.
Seen under this light, it becomes evident that when one considers what motivates economic activity, the Left and the Right really all converge in their aspirations. Businesses benefit from wokedom’s inadvertent creation of new markets. Capitalists out to secure the Darwinian free market upon which their talent for accumulation bore them vast wealth embrace the Right. All the fruits ultimately end up in the same bank accounts.",Politics
"Philippine politicians and oligarchs are all crass — whether they be a Marcos, an Aquino, or a Duterte or any one of their minions",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/philippine-politicians-and-oligarchs-are-all-crass-whether-they-be-a-marcos-an-aquino-or-a-duterte-or-any-one-of-their-minions/,"The only bunch of people who are really confused about where their place is in the Philippines’ political landscape are — you guessed it — the Yellowtards. These people are the country’s political parasites. They deliberately do not commit to a stable ideological framework because they need to maintain a high degree of fluidity in their principles to allow them to easily slither into whatever political bloc of the time offers them the highest ground in the next election.
Consider how these crooks have positioned themselves today. From being rabid Martial Law Crybabies in the campaign leadup to (and even over the decades before) the 2022 national elections that saw the ascent to power of Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr., the Yellowtards have suddenly gone silent on their tiresome but nonetheless renowned Marcos-is-Evil rhetoric. Indeed, you’d think this would be a long-overdue sensible posture when one considers that the Yellowtard powers-that-be share a lot more basic values with the garden-variety Filipino oligarchs that hold court in the current Marcos government today than with those surrounding the Duterte clan of Mindanao (led by former President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte). After all, many Yellowtard oligarchs are related both by blood and by marriage to many Marcos cronies and are members of the same chi chi Manila golf and country clubs. Imperial Manila, in short.
Imperial Manila people, after all, fancy themselves as members of the urbane elite cream of society that are antitheses to the Philippines’ deep south probinsyano sub-culture. To be fair, the Dutertes do conduct themselves in ways consistent to that stereotype looking back at the character of the former president’s administration and as made evident more recently in the shrill behaviour the Vice President exhibited under the spotlight in those congressional “inquiries” into her budget.
The interesting thing is that when one steps back far enough from all that and regards Philippine society from an outsider’s perspective, all of these characters come across as the same monolithic picture of crassness. Much as the promdi archetype of the Philippine south attracts the derision of Manila’s sosyal set, there is something to be said about the equally tacky way the Marcoses celebrate their birthdays with an astoundingly tone-deaf grandiosity. That’s not to even mentioning the infantile way First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos herself struts around. At the end of the day, they are all the same, whether we are talking about a Marcos, an Aquino, a Robredo, or a Duterte.
The easy way to sum up this general crassness of Philippine society (which characterises even its most chi chi elite subset) is in how the Philippine entertainment industry portrays them. We did write some time ago about the amusing reality that Filipino actors do not know how to portray rich people because “Filipino script writers are incapable of grasping the nuances of what it means to be a true member of the alta ciudad (high society). To top that with another layer of dysfunction, Filipino actors and actresses are woefully ill-equipped to play such characters.”
Shouting matches, loud monologues, and slapstick chatter pepper stories about “love” between characters from opposite sides of the tracks, one-dimensional infidelity, and infantile youth angst. In short, the cinematic devices haven’t evolved much since Lavinia Arguelles played by the late Cherie Gil issued the words “You’re nothing, but a second-rate trying hard copycat!” to Dorina Pineda played by Sharon Cuneta in the 1985 film Bituing Walang Ningning.
Seems we were being too kind at the time. There is no true alta ciudad in the Philippines because all elite Filipinos really have is money and none of what makes one a truly well-bred member of elite society that exhibits grace as a matter of routine habit. This means Philippine entertainment creatives actually had nothing much to work with to begin with. Indeed, if even the most chi chi of Philippine learning institutions, the Ateneo de Manila, which counts amongst its illustrious products no less than the First Lady, fugitive former Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman Andy Bautista, and default Yellowtard leader Leni Robredo fails to instil that breeding and grace, what hope is there for all the sub A-Listers out there? Then again, breeding and grace are supposedly things one would have learnt in kindergarten, right? That leaves much to be desired in that much-vaunted “strict” Filipino parenting style.
Circling back to the original point, one could forgive the Yellowtards’ confused state. The only real way to escape the dysfunction of Philippine society is to remove one’s self from it. Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, like all the rest of them, their top “thought leaders” routinely fail to think outside of the little square that frames Filipino thinking. The worst outcome of this smallness of thinking that afflicts even the “best and brightest” products of the Philippines education system is in how much of what characterises the Philippine Political “Debate” still hasn’t changed.",Politics
Failed 1Sambayan “united opposition” in 2021 now a template for opposition to Duterte dynasty in 2025 elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/failed-1sambayan-united-opposition-in-2021-now-a-template-for-opposition-to-duterte-dynasty-in-2025-elections/,"Philippine electoral politics are back to plumbing an all-too-familiar theme — preventing a [insert bogeyman’s name here] win. The spectre of three Dutertes in the Senate has been the subject of furious chatter amongst the intelligentsia over the last couple of weeks since Vice President Sara Duterte dropped hints that her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte and her two brothers, Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte and House Representative 1st District of Davao City Paolo Duterte, are planning to run for senators in the 2025 mid-term elections. The chatter is furious enough that two noted “thought leaders” wrote on this topic in their respective newspaper columns.
Joel Ruiz Butuyan issues a chilling question in his Inquirer piece, “Will there be three Dutertes in the Senate?”. Butuyan then writes…
[…] the election of three Duterte senators will reverberate with strong political implications. It will mean two things. One, the Dutertes remain strong contenders to retake the presidency in 2028 despite efforts to sideline them. Two, there’s widespread people’s dissatisfaction with the Marcoses. The strong showing of the Dutertes will be fueled by disenchantment with the Marcoses for the latter’s failure to improve the people’s lot.
…essentially pointing out the amusing irony that underlies the Yellowtards’ and commies’ cheering the unravelling of the “Unity Team” banner that erstwhile allies of convenience Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte ran under in the campaign lead-up to the 2022 national elections. That, plus the two “traditional” oppositionists’ cozying up with the Son of the Dictator’s administration pretty much created the force that is the subject of their new “anyone-but-him” campaign. Indeed, the Yellowtards, interestingly enough, worked frantically to cobble together a “unity” team of their own to mount an Anyone-but-Bongbong-Marcos bid during the 2021-2022 election campaign. Dubbed the “1Sambayan” coalition, the ill-thought-out bid for a “united opposition” fell flat on its face. Get Real Post contributor Ramon Ortoll wrote following its spectacular fall…
The Opposition finally reaped what they sowed yesterday, the 12th of June 2021. The 1Sambayan coalition didn’t have any viable candidates to present to the public nor did they have a platform. It was still the same old narrative from the Marcos era about “freedom and democracy”. No sooner after they named their bets [themselves aspiring presidential candidates] that the same began issuing polite statements basically saying we don’t want anything to do with you. Democracy died yesterday because the Opposition committed political suicide. Instead of insults and destablization the Opposition should have focused on taking a fiscalizer role and working with the administration. They don’t have the patience and diligence to put in the hard work which only served to expose their lust for power and the absence of a genuine concern for the welfare of the Filipino people.
Funny how, today, the very fiasco in the failed “united opposition” project of the Yellowtards in 2021 now serves as the template aspiration of the major parties now at play — the Yellowtards, the commies, and now the Marcostards — to oppose the emerging Duterte juggernaut. An abject failure of imagination as Prof. Antonio Contreras writes in his Manila Times piece of a similar title citing “[former Senator Antonio] Trillanes’ argument that a unity ticket between the traditional political opposition and the Marcos coalition would be the best move to stop the Dutertes from regaining power” and current Senate minority leader Risa Hontiveros’s opposition to it. Contreras writes..
Hontiveros should be reminded that it is no longer Marcos and Duterte fighting over the same slice of the electorate, leaving the opposition to dwell in its own comfort zone. In 2025, it will be the Marcoses and the traditional political opposition forces who will be fighting over the anti-Duterte slice of the electorate.
And this is the mathematical reality that also eludes the diehard Marcos loyalists who think the much-vaunted 31 million votes for Marcos Jr. would remain intact after the break-up of the UniTeam.
Undoubtedly, both the traditional political opposition and the diehard Marcos loyalists face a crisis of political imagination. They both dwell on the grievances of the past instead of the dangers of a Duterte in the future.
“As in the past, the public will get entertained but everyone will go home empty-handed, except for the winning candidate’s camp,” Butuyan laments in conclusion. Empty-handed and empty-brained. Small surprise we see the same thing happening all over again — the products of the same empty brains that were the remains of the day of the previous elections. And all the ones that came before it.",Politics
Vice President Sara Duterte echoes Yellow-Commie call to dig up Marcos remains!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/10/vice-president-sara-duterte-echoes-yellow-commie-call-to-dig-up-marcos-remains/,"Vice President Inday Sara Duterte made her own bed and she should lie in it. Her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte (PRRD) wasn’t short on advice to her in the lead up to the 2022 elections where Inday teamed up with then presidential candidate (now President) Bongbong Marcos. PRRD needed to be protected from his enemies after stepping down and have a chance at continuing what he started if only Inday agreed to the plan that she run for president with  Senator Bong Go, or even former Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief — now Senator — Ronald ‘Bato’ dela Rosa. Instead, she made her own decision, listened to  Bongbong’s sister Imee and former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA), her two erstwhile allies in ousting Bebot Alvarez, and ran with Marcos.
Father knows best, specially one who has been in politics for a long time. You’re foolish and naive if you don’t watch your back in this game. Duterte wouldn’t have become president if it were not for the late former President Fidel Ramos being very wary at the prospect of either former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, former Vice President Jejomar Binay or Senator Grace Poe becoming president. Ramos chose Duterte and had the Davao network, which supported him in 1992, do the same for Duterte’s campaign. Former Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez was open to it because Duterte was his classmate in elementary through high school, before he got kicked out of Ateneo.
Inday does not have the kind of network PRRD had on hand to tap when he ran. Now, she’s put their whole family in the crosshairs of a demolition job because she’s still the frontrunner for the 2028 elections. If Marcos was sincere in getting her support, he would’ve protected her. But as we saw after the election, GMA was the first to be sidelined. Then Inday. One by one the Duterte appointees are being taken out of their posts. Inday is one of two big fish, the other being PRRD. Marcos won’t sick the International Criminal Court (ICC) on them but his lieutenants are going to make sure that they won’t be a threat come 2028.
It won’t be a walk in the park because the Muslims are restive again because of Special Assistant to the President Antonio Lagdameo Jr who seems to be mishandling the fragile politics in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The peace that PRRD worked hard for in Mindanao may unravel under Lagdameo’s watch. At least the Maranaos in BARMM are still sticking to the plan. The Supreme Court ruling on Sulu is detrimental and could cause the resurgence of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). PRRD will make his last stand in Mindanao.
Inday has to step up to the plate and learn how to be a proper leader real quick. Otherwise, if PRRD goes, they may likely suffer the same fate as their grandfather, Vicente, who was sidelined by the late former President Ferdinand E. Marcos (FEM) in 1967. One could say he died of a broken heart. This is why PRRD never completely trusted the Marcoses. He paid his political debt by allowing Marcos’ burial and getting Imee elected as Senator. But he never appointed BBM to a government post in his administration. Nor did he help with his electoral protest. He knew better.
No amount of temper tantrums from Inday, will “stop” the demolition campaign against her family. Her most recent alboroto, threatening to backpedal on her father’s acquiescence to the burial of FEM at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes’ Cemetery) by digging up the latter’s remains and throwing them into the “West Philippine Sea”, comes across as infantile…
“Hindi ko alam. Isang beses sinabihan ko talaga si Sen. Imee (Marcos), ‘pag ‘di tumigil, huhukayin ko and tatay ninyo at itatapon ko sya sa West Philippine Sea,” Duterte said.
(I don’t know. One time, I told Sen. Imee that if it does not stop, I’ll dig up the body of your father and throw him in the West Philippine Sea.)
Duterte on Friday accused President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. of not knowing how to rule a country — her latest tirade against her running-mate in the 2022 elections.
…coming across as no more mature than the equally adolescent ‘activism’ of traditional anti-Marcos mobs.
Inday is responsible for the consequences of her actions and she should be more circumspect and pragmatic. She should take it upon herself to become the leader she can become on her own since she has said that she never listens to her father and she is her own person. With that assertion comes the task of taking personal accountability for the bind she finds herself in.",Politics
The Philippines: An American Vassal Again?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/10/the-philippines-an-american-vassal-again/,"In recent years, several alarming developments have unfolded, placing the Philippines once again in the crosshairs of superpower politics. The country’s historic ties with the United States have often been characterized by a complicated blend of dependency, cooperation, and coercion. Today, this dynamic raises urgent concerns as the Philippines becomes increasingly entangled in the geopolitical military designs of its former colonial master.
Three contentious issues stand at the forefront: the reported deployment of the U.S.-developed Volt Typhoon spyware within allied nations, including the Philippines; the U.S.’s controversial plan to process Afghan refugees on Philippine soil before they are relocated to the U.S.; and the reinvigorated use of Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites, which are purportedly for humanitarian purposes but increasingly appear aimed at containing China’s rise in the region.
These developments suggest that the Philippines may once again be serving as a pawn in American power struggles rather than exercising full autonomy in its foreign policy.
The Volt Typhoon Spyware: The Digital Trojan Horse
The Volt Typhoon spyware, developed by the U.S. for cyber surveillance and espionage, has allegedly been deployed in various allied nations, including the philippines. This sophisticated software is more than a simple tool for monitoring; it functions as a digital Trojan horse that can infiltrate networks, steal sensitive data, and compromise national security. For a country like the Philippines, still developing its cyber defense infrastructure, the implications are particularly troubling.
The U.S. has a history of surveillance practices even on its closest allies. In 2023, a leaked Pentagon report revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies had spied on Ukraine and other partners amid the conflict with Russia. Previously, reports from Danish intelligence showed that the U.S. had also spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top European officials by using Danish internet cables. Such actions demonstrate a pattern of overreach by the U.S., raising questions about the true purpose of Volt Typhoon in the Philippines.
Though the U.S. frames Volt Typhoon as a tool to protect its allies from cyberattacks, its capabilities allow for extensive espionage—not just against external threats but also against the very governments it is supposedly designed to protect. For the Philippines, this raises several disturbing questions: Why should we trust a foreign power to protect us while placing our digital sovereignty at risk? How much of our government’s sensitive information has already been exposed? More critically, is the Philippines merely a convenient cyber battleground in America’s broader Cold War against China?
Instead of relying on foreign technology, shouldn’t we invest in our own cyber defense systems? By maintaining our digital sovereignty, we can avoid becoming just another pawn in America’s global chess game.
Afghan Refugees: An American-Created Problem, a Filipino Burden
Another issue raising eyebrows is the decision to temporarily house Afghan refugees in the Philippines while they await processing for relocation to the U.S. This plan, initiated in the wake of the U.S.’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, has led to concerns over national security, sovereignty, and the real motivations behind this policy.
The Initial reports claiming these individuals were “refugees” were later corrected, revealing that they are former Afghan employees who worked for the U.S. military during its occupation of Afghanistan. With the U.S. possessing vast land and resources, why offload this responsibility onto a developing nation like the Philippines?
The lack of transparency from both the Philippine and American governments has only deepened public suspicion. What are the long-term implications for the Philippines? Hosting refugees, particularly from a conflict zone as volatile as Afghanistan, introduces risks—ranging from potential security threats to strain on local infrastructure. Moreover, what happens if the U.S. decides to change its plans? Will the refugees be stuck in the Philippines indefinitely? Will this become a precedent, setting an expectation for future interventions where the Philippines is expected to “clean up” America’s messes?
Time and again, the U.S. has made decisions that affect the Philippines without consulting or prioritizing the welfare of the Filipino people. We must ask ourselves: are we truly an equal partner, or just a convenient dumping ground?
Dangers of EDCA Bases
The expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites across the Philippines has turned the nation into a potential target within the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific strategy. While these bases are presented as hubs for disaster relief and humanitarian missions, they are located in strategic areas, particularly close to Taiwan and the South China Sea.
There are growing concerns that these bases could host U.S. military systems, including missiles, which might be perceived as a threat by adversarial nations. Reports have already indicated that the Philippines could be caught in the nuclear crosshairs of Russia, as Philippine cooperation with the U.S. raises alarm among rival powers. This alignment heightens the risks, effectively turning the Philippines into a satellite state for U.S. interests and putting the country on the front line of potential conflict between superpowers.
With tensions rising between the U.S. and China, the Philippines finds itself, once again, at the heart of a potential conflict between giants. The Filipino people must ask: Is this alliance beneficial, or are we risking too much for a partnership that prioritizes U.S. interests over our own?
The Struggle for Genuine Sovereignty
The common thread linking these issues is the Philippines’ subservient role in America’s global strategy. Whether it’s the deployment of Volt Typhoon spyware, the processing of Afghan refugees, or the strategic use of EDCA bases, the Philippines is repeatedly positioned as a tool for American interests rather than an independent nation with its own priorities.
Who truly benefits from this arrangement? Is it the Filipino people, or the American military-industrial complex? Is our government acting in the interests of its citizens, or simply following Washington’s lead?
The Philippines has a long, complex history with the United States, but this relationship must evolve. We must assert our independence and prioritize our own national interests. By investing in our own cyber defense infrastructure, crafting a foreign policy that reflects Filipino values, and developing a defense strategy that doesn’t rely on foreign powers, the Philippines can finally move toward genuine sovereignty.
The Filipino people deserve more than to be pawns in another nation’s agenda. It’s time for real independence from hegemons who act for their interests alone.",Politics
The Real Pawns,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/04/the-real-pawns/,"The recent scandal that shook the almighty kingdom of Duterteland seems to have triggered a slew of defensive social media posts from Former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s (FPRRD) sycophants. As recent news coverage has shown, FPRRD’s former spokesman Atty. Harry Roque revealed that FPRRD accepted a “gentleman’s agreement” with Beijing, when he was still president, to “maintain the status quo” that neither China nor the Philippines will move to conduct any improvements in the Ayungin Shoal. This agreement effectively limited Philippine vessels to only deliver water and food to our troops stationed at the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War 2 Era Philippine ship grounded there, and not any construction materials to fortify it. Dutertards have been quick to downplay the revelation saying that there was nothing secret about the deal. Missing in the Duterte narrative is the fact that the deal FPRRD made was already a tacit surrender of our legal position in Ayungin by acknowledging China’s terms. We’ll delve more into that later.
How did we really get into all this mess? Was it because of FPRRD’s boneheaded “gentleman’s agreement”? (Quite an oxymoron as FPRRD is hardly known to be a gentleman, but I digress.) Was it because of President Bongbong Marcos Jr’s subservience to America, as Dutertards seem to be pushing in their narrative? Was it because of the late former president Noynoy Aquino’s belligerent stance against China during his term? The answer to all the questions is a ‘No’. The issue started way back after the then-called Magic 12 senators led the country to saying ‘No’ to extending the US bases renewal in the Philippines in 1991. In a nutshell, there was enough anti-American sentiment to kick the US forces out of the Philippines back then. What was the root of the anti-American sentiment? Well, it was really mostly the left’s usual anti-“Yankee Imperialism” schtick. Sure, we’ll hear about “American atrocities” from previous wars (not just the from the Philippine-American War), as if America has only contributed evil and misery to the world and that its abusive nature is like a case of herpes that simply won’t go away. But at the end of the day anti-American sentiment just boils down to nothing but the jingoistic claptrap of “Americans Bad, Filipinos Good”. The very same thing that FPRRD and his sycophants have been promoting since FPRRD rose to power and up to now.
On December 21, 1992, the Military Bases Agreement with the US was officially terminated. Without American presence a power vacuum in the area was created. The next closest emerging power back then was China and sure enough, early in February 1995, the Philippines was caught off-guard by finding out that the Chinese has taken a territory that is within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Chinese forces were found present with a Chinese flag flying over the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef that is only around 200 kilometers away from Palawan. After the Mischief Reef invasion, another Philippine-claimed territory was invaded by China in 2012 – the Scarborough Shoal. In addition to the invasions, China also interfered with Philippine Oil exploration activities in the Reed Bank in 2011 as well as illegally built installations and artificial islands on Mischief Reef in May of 2013. Yes, this is the very same China that Sara Duterte has praised as generous to us in Mandarin and that Imee Marcos has claimed to have never attempted, in any way, to take us over.
So now that we have essentially lost control over Mischief Reef and the Scarborough Shoal, how should we deal with the China threat regarding Ayungin and the other territories in the area where we have a claim on? To his credit, Philippine president Noynoy Aquino led the Philippines against China in an international arbitral tribunal landmark victory where the Chinese claim over almost the entire South China Sea, through its self-defined 9-dash line (which has been upgraded to 10 or perhaps even 11 now). We know that this bogus China-defined line was largely overruled by the international tribunal. However, instead of building on the legal victory of Aquino, then new president Rodrigo Duterte decided to take a different tact by using a Neville Chamberlain-like Appeasement approach. For avid students of history, we remember how former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used such a diplomatic approach by making concessions to an aggressive foreign power (Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany) in order to avoid war. Chamberlain embraced this policy as the British people during the 1930s were desperate to avoid the slaughter of another world war (they just went through World War 1 just around a little more than 10 years prior) and that domestic issues such as the economy was deemed to be more important to focus on. But as history has shown us, the Appeasement approach was shown to be a failure because Nazi Germany’s expansionism continued, and British war engagement ended up being unavoidable. Nowadays, this Appeasement diplomatic approach is widely discredited but for some reason Duterte and the Dutertards still believe and insist that appeasing an aggressive and powerful expansionist China is the only solution to avoid a war.
So, under President Marcos’ approach of taking a principled stance of protecting our country’s national interest by working with other friendly nations that share common values and interests with us such as the United States, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, the EU, India, and many more, are we likely headed for war? The Dutertards seem hell-bent in making the people believe so. This is not entirely surprising as it is no secret that FPRRD and the Duterte partisans adhere to the anti-American sentiment, the very same sentiment espoused by those who kicked the Americans out of the Philippines in the early 1990s which created a power vacuum that led to our current predicament. Moreover, FPRRD and a few of the well-known Duterte sycophants are, or at least have been, beneficiaries of the graces of China. So, what is the connection between the war narrative being peddled by Duterte sycophants and the anti-American sentiments?
The Chinese Communist Party adheres to the Zhou dynasty era strategy taken from Sun Tzu’s book The Art of War called the 3 Warfares Strategy. This consists of: public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare. The idea behind this strategy is to win a war without firing a single shot but by merely using three fronts.
Public Opinion Warfare
This is currently being done by shaping public opinion using the all-too common anti-American (or anti-West) sentiment prevalent among the left and Duterte supporters. It basically serves as an all-too common read meat for a pack of wolves to be excited about. Infest the discussion about Chinese encroachment and aggression by invoking a favorite boogeyman, American intervention and prodding, and the whole issue shifts from China’s encroachment and aggression to America merely using the Philippines for its own selfish interest. Then of course, once Filipinos see America as the bad guy then the old adage applies: “The enemy of my enemy, is my friend”. Before you know it, we’ll all be joining VP Sara Duterte in unison.
Psychological Warfare
China has, and continues to intimidate its competitors, using its military’s image of size and strength. They flaunt their huge naval fleet and military power to give everybody a scare. The aim, of course, is to undermine our ability to conduct combat defense and deterrence operations by shocking and demoralizing our military personnel and supporting civilian populations. But if a country’s leader is dumb enough to cower in fear just like Duterte, then China already gets a huge upper-hand. A leader projecting a submissive stance by saying: “Do you want war against China? I’ll tell you, even on the coast beach of Palawan, before you can take off, the missile of China would be there in about five or 10 minutes. It would be a massacre if I go and fight a war now. We are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side.”  Even if it is true that our military strength is no match against China’s, the projection of submissiveness and weakness from a leader affects the morale of his troops. The reason why China loves Duterte is because Duterte’s pusillanimous mindset plays perfectly well into their strategy.
Legal Warfare
China has used, as its legal basis, its historical ownership of the South China Sea. As US Major Morgan Martin of the US Naval Institute correctly said:
The PRC’s psychological and legal warfare activities go hand in glove and are focused heavily on the South China Sea. Alleging historical ownership, China has claimed several islands in the region, ignoring protests from neighboring countries and international tribunal rulings to the contrary. The area has significant untapped oil reserves and is a major global trade route; gaining exclusive control of the South China Sea would contribute a great deal to the PRC achieving regional and global hegemony. The ways it has attempted to do so are prime examples of psychological and legal warfare in action.
The PRC initially used legal warfare in the South China Sea by appealing to international legal bodies to legitimize its territorial claims. When those bodies have rejected the claims, the PRC has branded them as illegitimate and refused to abide by their findings. This ultimately undermines the legitimacy of these bodies and decreases stability in the region, as neighboring nations become more uncertain of the legal status of the South China Sea.”
Unfortunately, the Philippines had a president from 2016 – 2022 who willingly served as China’s useful idiot by even supporting China’s sore-loser tantrum when he said: “They (Aquino administration) filed a case, we won. That paper, in real life, between nations, that paper is nothing. …  Actually, in street parlance, I would tell you, ‘Give that to me? Son of a bitch, that’s just a piece of paper. I’ll throw it in the wastebasket.”
So, is President Bongbong Marcos Jr.’s approach going to lead us to a war we cannot win and where our mutual defense treaty partner, the United States will simply leave us out to twist in the wind? The Duterte sycophants seem to be going overtime in pushing for that narrative. Sure, there is always a possibility of the worst outcome, but probability is another question. How probable is an armed warfare with China be? Would it be in China’s best interest to trigger the US-Philippine mutual defense treaty should it decide to pulverize the Philippines with its powerful army and weapons? So, from dealing with a small country with an inferior armed force, what benefit will China gain if its action will escalate the situation by having a powerful nation with around 10 times more nuclear weapons than it has, enter into the mix? That is just the United States, what about our other allies that President Marcos has gained who expressed willingness to support us with our territorial defense? So far, the Philippines has the United States, the EU, Japan, Australia and about 16 other countries that have expressed support to the Philippines and the rule of law. To get into a war with the Philippines will further risk China into further isolation on the world stage. Despite its belligerence regarding its loss on the international arbitral ruling against the Philippines, it recognized that international law is not on its side! That is why it has resorted to gray-zone attacks against the Philippines to keep things from going to a full-scale war. If it really was intent on war China certainly has the capability of pulverizing the Philippines in less than a day. But it hasn’t and it likely won’t precisely because there are too many factors at play that may make things a lot riskier and a lot worse for its situation. The 3 Warfares Strategy is what it has chosen and continues to play. Unfortunately, we have FPRRD and the Duterte sycophants who seem to be acting as unwitting agents for the Chinese Communist Party to carry out at least some components of its 3 Warfare Strategy.
It is quite refreshing that we now have a president who is taking a principled stance with regards to protecting our country’s EEZ. The agreement that President Marcos Jr.’s predecessor made with China was essentially a tacit surrender of our ownership of the Ayungin Shoal. Former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio said: “President Duterte knew that without repairs, the BRP Sierra Madre would soon collapse and, thus, end our presence in Ayungin Shoal, … Yet Duterte agreed, in a concession to China, that the Philippines could only bring food and water to BRP Sierra Madre and would not bring materials to repair the Sierra Madre. … Duterte’s ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ was lopsided in favor of China… That ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ was a disguised surrender of our EEZ rights over Ayungin Shoal as it gave China veto power over our exclusive right to erect structures on Ayungin Shoal”.",Politics
#USelection2024: Woke liberals did it again!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/uselection2024-woke-liberals-did-it-again/,"Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States. He won on the back of a no-nonsense campaign that addressed issues that hit Americans right at their very backyards. This proved effective against rival and Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris’s play of the gender and race cards backed by a who’s who of A-list celebrity endorsements. These elections all but served as an overdue indictment of the strategic orthodoxy stubbornly latched on to by the Democrats.
Victory was decisive. It was all over by the middle of the week with Trump claiming the votes of all the critical swing states. Trump proclaimed victory before a Florida crowd even before the results were officially announced: “I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” he crowed. This follows months of one poll or the other over the last several months claiming that the race was “neck-and-neck”. In the end, Trump won 292 electorates and did even better than how he did in his first run in 2020 in almost every state — a landslide by most measures.
The woke liberal crowd and their media henchmen committed the same mistake again, banking on hasty polls, basking in the light of the numerically-superior crowds they bussed into their rallies, and engaging in mutual high-fiving within their echo chambers. Polls and public rallies failed to reflect the sentiment of millions of voters who were disinclined to express their true political views publicly and in “polite” company. We can thank the wokes’ virulent cancel culture for that. They basically drove Trump’s support base underground and outside the lines of sight of their inbred political “analyses”.
Ultimately, Harris’s campaign missed the mark by a mile. Voters were angry and battle lines were drawn were none used to be by the divisive messaging of the Democrats and their woke coastal following. A campaign on the back of “woman power” and “black power” failed to move a big enough number of voters. Americans did not care about being led by “the first female president” in their history. Being a woman — or, for that matter, a man — indeed has nothing to do with the quality of leadership.
Just as important is how the entertainment industry’s elite came out of all this utterly humbled. Their unsolicited political opinion pushed into Americans’ screens by complicit corporate media turned out to be irrelevant. It seems, at some point over the last several years, people worked out that pretty faces who lived in gated communities “sharing” their political views to fans were essentially insulting their intelligence.
It’s going to be another interesting four years ahead. Lessons will hopefully be learnt. Then again, maybe they won’t.",Politics
People who don’t understand why Donald Trump won will NEVER get it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/people-who-dont-understand-why-donald-trump-won-will-never-get-it/,"Had to believe that a veteran political operative such as Lito Banayo dislikes US president-elect Donald Trump. What’s not hard to believe is he has a child who is a US citizen. Most of the children of the elite of our country are dual citizens or have migrated to other countries for obvious reasons. Banayo writes in his Manila Standard piece “Reality trumps ideals” about how his daughter who lives in San Francisco voted in these elections…
To my consternation, she picked Trump.
“How could you possibly go for an irascible felon?” I asked.
Her response did not shock. “Pa, do you know how different America has become since you last came here?”
“I cannot go to the streets of San Francisco. In fact, my younger daughters have never been there, as it is such an awful, dreadful place, and mostly because those bleeding heart Democrats won’t touch the homeless, drug-crazed derelicts that litter Union Square all the way to the waterfront,” she stated.
It says a lot about how our elites view their own country; perhaps just a milking cow. If Banayo can’t see through US President Joe Biden and his family then it’s over for him as an operative. The only recent candidate of his who won is former President Rodrigo Duterte and he wasn’t a principal player in that campaign. We all know how Isko Moreno’s campaign ended. Isko is going back to Manila. That’s if Sam Verzosa’s message ever gains ground. Then again, Bagong Mukha, Bagong Maynila is pretty lame.
If you still don’t believe the Democrats are bad for America then you probably won’t believe the state of California, particularly its de facto capital of San Francisco. I thought that the video I saw on TikTok was AI because downtown never looked that bad when I was a business traveler in the 90s. Our office was near Chinatown and the financial district at Sansome St. Most of Union Square is now closed down. Macy’s, I. Magnin, Victoria’s Secret, Nordstrom, they’re all gone now no thanks to a procession of Democrat governors and mayors. Most of my high school batchmates have moved to other states like Nevada, where the cost of living is reasonable and even Texas. It’s inevitable as they near retirement age.
Banayo is surprised that Trump won. I wasn’t. The writing was on the wall since 2020. The red states wouldn’t have stood for another Democrat winning the presidency. America is not San Francisco, New York or the other major cities on both coasts. America is the midwest and the south, the agricultural and industrial heartland of the average Joe. That Trump won all the swing states speaks volumes about the disenchantment of the average Joe against the Democrats. Trump may still be a registered Republican but he’s not actually what could be described as a card-carrying member of the party. He used to be a Democrat.
What Trump represents now is Americans wanting to take their country back from the politicians and the deep state of the military-industrial complex which the later Dwight Eisenhower had been warning about since he became president. This is why Lyndon Johnson didn’t run for re-election and is what gave rise to George Bush and Barack Obama, under whose watch America turned the Middle East upside down. This is the America of Biden who got the US in a proxy war with Russia and increased tensions with China. The US, China and Russia have no reason to go to war. Putin and Xi aren’t imperialists. Trump isn’t either which is why the prospects for 2025 look good. But not for the Philippines.
It remains to be seen what rhetoric the administration will be mouthing now that Trump is president. Hopefully the president will stop repeating that stupid rules-based international order that the US and Europe use to justify their hegemony.",Politics
Vice President Sara Duterte shouldn’t have said those things,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/vice-president-sara-duterte-shouldnt-have-said-those-things/,"This is, after all, an age when even “harmless” jokes can get you in trouble with HR at the office. What Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte did in what came across as a grave threat against Philippine President Bongbong Marcos is inexcusable. Duterte, after all, is second in line to the top job. Indeed, the whole point of her role as vice president is invoked if the president is rendered unable to fulfill his role in any way — such as if he is killed by an assassin.
Interestingly, that is exactly what Duterte reportedly suggests might happen.
Don’t worry about my security because I’ve talked with somebody. I said ‘if I’m killed, you’ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke…
Not a joke, as Duterte herself asserts.
This is not to discount the possibility that there may, indeed, be a threat to her life as she claims. Even then, the Vice President shouldn’t have said those things. What cannot be excused is her inability to get a grip. An ability to keep a level head and maintain one’s aim under fire is what sets apart a well-trained and seasoned soldier from a street thug armed with a recently-purchased (or stolen) paltik.
Imagine then what kind of president Sara Duterte would have made. She evidently is not her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and possesses none of his gravitas. The daughter matches the father’s faculties for wit and tongue-in-cheek eloquence with no more than hysterics. Perhaps, the only thing she inherits from the former President is his vast cult following. It is precious capital she now wastes.
Then again, the Dutertards are exactly that — a cult following. Like the BTS Army, they will apply their mental faculties not to critical thinking but to the task of justifying every one of Sara Duterte’s infantile actions. They make an emotional choice and not an intellectual one as one might have observed of any cult following for that matter.
If Sara Duterte truly aspires to build on the immense political capital her father leaves her, she needs to step up and be a bigger person. Rather than rest on the assurances of her rabid fans, she needs to lead them to be better citizens. The alternative is to see her squander her father’s legacy or, worse, end up in prison. The former may not be in the cards yet, but the latter becomes a strong possibility with every ill thought out word she utters and with every adolescent theatric she delivers before the cameras. Filipinos who want to be better Filipinos deserve a bit more in a potential leader than that.
To be fair, there really isn’t much of a better landscape of options outside of the Duterte cult to begin with. Then again, this is Philippine politics where voters decide amongst lesser evils and not the best among the good.",Politics
MELTDOWN! Sara Duterte’s lack of mental discipline is eroding her father’s vast political capital,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/meltdown-sara-dutertes-lack-of-mental-discipline-is-eroding-her-fathers-vast-political-capital/,"If nobody’s noticed yet, there is a common denominator argument used across the board in the Philippines’ national “debate”, and that is that politicians on the other camp are “power-hungry crooks” out to “steal from Filipino taxpayers”. Whether one is a Yellowtard, a Marcostard, a Dutertard, or a commie terrorist, the argument is that or the other or both and every influencer is a “paid hack” — a.k.a. bayaran — on the payroll of one or the other crook or cheat.
Such is the easy way one can summarise the stunted debate amongst the Philippines’ so-called intelligentsia — a blanket exercise of accusing the other of political agendas and intent to defraud. In such chatter, one would be hard-pressed to find a point in even listening much more participating. All we see are assertions and accusations built upon layers of unsound assumptions and not much else.
If we are to step back from all that, it would seem that Filipinos only have one pathway ahead that leads to none other than the inevitability of being mere consumers milked by an elite class of savvy political operators and capitalists. Note the term savvy. “Greed” and “crookedness” are overly judgmental terms that can be replaced by that simple term. In a free market, savviness is what wins in a game where money is the only true and objective scoring mechanism. The former two terms are just flavours of the latter third.
Ultimately, democracy — like the free market — is a playing field. The best gamers win and are the ones who get to rake all the money in. Filipinos are just the proverbial ball one kicks around. Where the ball gets kicked to the most determines who wins.
This is exactly the reality what The Noted One describes in his recent Inquirer piece, “From meltdown to showdown”. In his column Manuel L Quezon III summarises the strategies of the two titanic clans currently stomping through the playing field…
[…] the Marcos-Romualdez method for achieving political success is to play the long game, combining relentless pressure with overwhelming force while exercising strategic patience. In other words, the boa constrictor style of political operations. The Duterte style is shock and awe: explosive brinksmanship to intimidate opponents into backing down or backing off, zeroing in, when needed, on specific enemies to clobber in order to make an example of them. In other words, the silverback gorilla style of leadership.
Within that frame, Quezon, the sportscaster, issues his halftime analysis…
President [Bongbong Marcos] figured out something the ex-president [Rodrigo Duterte] and the Veep [his daughter, Sara Duterte] still haven’t figured out: how to innovate and learn from past mistakes. Having never lost before, and never experienced being challenged and defeated, the Dutertes may lack what it takes to win.
It’s simple, really. The camp with the best strategy and the most disciplined players stand a better chance of winning. As Quezon points out, the Duterte camp (and the community of “influencers” buzzing around it) possess neither. One would think a country that appoints itself the distinction of being the world’s “best” basketball players would get that.",Politics
Minimum Wage Hike from our Bleeding-heart Senators,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/02/minimum-wage-hike-from-our-bleeding-heart-senators/,"Photo from lookingforwinona.tumblr.com
Let’s do a head-to-head matchup! Former president Rodrigo Duterte, who is leading in the polls among possible senatoriables for the coming midterm elections, versus Baldomero Falcone, a two-time candidate for the Senate who has lost on both tries. Has Falcone served as an executive in a local government? No. Has Falcone served in the legislature? No. Does Falcone take Fentanyl? I’m not sure, maybe he doesn’t. Duterte, on the other hand, gets a yes on every point! Woo-hoo! Vote for Duterte! So why can’t we just give, say, a million Duterte votes to Falcone and shave off another million votes from each of the other top candidates in the Magic 10 to give Falcone a fair shot at winning a senate seat? For our bleeding-heart senators who have voted to increase the minimum wage by Php100 across the board, isn’t that pretty much the same concept? It is essentially the concept of redistribution of wealth! If we take from someone who produces to give to someone who doesn’t, or at least who doesn’t produce as much, you’re going to incentivize less production.
Duterte lackey and self-professed social justice advocate, senator Bong Go, stated:
“Mr. President, dapat po talaga ay may maayos na pasahod sa mga ordinaryong manggagawang Pilipino. It is the goal of this measure to provide for a living wage that allows our Filipino workers to earn enough for a satisfactory standard of living and prevent them from falling into poverty.
“Moreover, as an advocate of social justice, I just want to reiterate the importance of striking a balance between the interest of the employers and workers. Dapat po ay may pantay ding pagkilala sa karapatan at kapakanan ng lahat ng sektor sa lakas-paggawa.
“Sa mga mayayaman, kung di naman kayo malulugi, ipamahagi niyo naman po ang kita ninyo sa mga mahihirap — sa mga isang kahig, isang tuka, na bawat piso po ay napakahalaga na meron pong pambili ng pagkain, na may laman po ang tiyan sa araw-araw.
Translated:
“Mr. President, there should really be a proper wage for ordinary Filipino workers. It is the goal of this measure to provide for a living wage that allows our Filipino workers to earn enough for a satisfactory standard of living and prevent them from falling into poverty.
“Moreover, as an advocate of social justice, I just want to reiterate the importance of striking a balance between the interest of the employers and workers. There should also be equal recognition of the rights and welfare of all sectors in the workforce.
“To the rich, if you are not losing money, distribute your income to the poor – to those who have a one scratch, one peck type of life, that every peso is very important to buy food, that has a full stomach everyday.”
Wow! Bravo! Maybe senator Go should have proceeded in running for president in the last elections! So, will raising the minimum wage by Php100 really be the answer to alleviate many Filipinos out of poverty? Would raising the minimum wage to a “living wage” standard increase the per capita income of Filipinos?
When I was still in Environmental Engineering school, I heard a saying, in jest, that goes: “The solution to pollution is dilution!” The idea is that the concentration count of sh*t (coliforms) in a water sample would decrease if you increased the volume of water. You know what? That is true! You will see a decrease in coliform concentration count! But are we really eliminating the sh*t in the water and the underlying cause of why we are even getting sh*t in the water? This is precisely what our bleeding-heart senators are doing. They want to artificially raise the income per capita by hiking the minimum wage but that doesn’t even address poverty or why we have a miserable labor market! Why isn’t there enough job demand that pays this “living wage” to meet the available supply of labor in our country? We have so many able-bodied people available to work but not enough jobs that offer this supposed living wage!
Well, I believe former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo once told a former economics student of hers, “It’s the Economy, Student!”
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, more than 90% of business in the country are classified as “Micro enterprise” and this is followed by almost 9% classified under “Small enterprise”. So, we are dealing with many family-owned, mom and pop type of businesses and operations that will probably take a huge hit in profit margins should this wage hike push through that would increase their overhead cost. With higher overhead costs, many businesses would tend to resort to creative ways to keep their losses at a minimum. If they do not end up closing shop, some businesses may reduce their workforce. Another way to cut losses due to labor cost is to resort to schemes that will allow them to avoid paying benefits and things like the 13th month pay. Endo, does that ring a bell? Of course, the most common way for businesses to cut their losses is to pass the added cost to the consumers through price hikes for the goods and services they produce. What do we call the measure when prices of goods and services rise over time? That is correct – INFLATION! Now guess what happens when inflation catches up with the government-imposed wage increase? The wage increase loses its effect and who gets to suffer the most in this situation? The informal sector, precisely because they don’t receive any wage increases because they don’t have actual employers mandated to give them a minimum wage to begin with! These are the poorest of the poor these politicians love to pander to and give doleouts like the 4Ps to! Is it any wonder why we have a huge underemployment problem? Is it any wonder why the prices of goods and services keep on rising and many Filipinos in the country’s labor force cannot escape from Endo? It seems like we have a bunch of economic Einsteins in the senate and a bunch of economic Darwin award recipients among the electorate who love voting for these types of senatorial clowns!
Depending on the region, the minimum wage in the Philippines ranges from Php341 to Php610 per day. If we embrace the sentiments of self-professed social justice advocates like senator Bong Go, in providing a satisfactory standard of living for Filipino workers, why just increase the minimum wage by Php100? Why not by Php1,000? Php10,000 even? Heck, the senators can legislate a minimum wage of Kardashian proportions, but the fact is, it really doesn’t matter because the hike won’t make food, tuition fees, medical bills, and oil prices cheaper and Endo will still be around!
So, the rich should redistribute their income to the poor, as the good and brilliant Davao senator said? So basically, if you have a bit more, you should give it to someone who has a bit less. Now, that is fine and dandy if this is something voluntary. However, if this is through legislation, it has the force of law! The bill actually describes fines of Php25,000 to Php100,000, or with imprisonment of between 2-4 years, as well as award of back pay for employers violating the law. So essentially, the government is forcing employers to give more of their profits under the threat of monetary consequences and imprisonment. What happens when we force the reduction of profits from businesses? It results in the business having less, or even nothing, to invest with in developing and expanding their business. So, the incentive for businesses to hire more people gets reduced.
While it may sound noble and compassionate for these legislators to improve the financial lives of the people, as we have seen many times over, these populist laws that the legislators impose on people are often the cause of our economic problems! If senator Go wants the rich to redistribute their wealth to the poor, maybe he can get his friend, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, to fork out maybe 35% of his wealth to the poor when he meets this “Appointed Son of God” in the senate on March 5, during which the pastor is scheduled to appear to answer the allegations against him for human trafficking, sexual abuse, violence, and other abuses. Or maybe Go himself can voluntarily give out 35% of his wealth to the poor! Hey, his benefactor, former president Duterte says Go is a billionaire! The good senator doesn’t need that much, right? How about the rest of the senators who voted for the measure? Will they fork over 35% of their millions or even billions to the poor?  Yah, I am not holding my breath on that.",Politics
The Duterte Chinese Brown-nosing Diplomacy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/04/the-duterte-chinese-brown-nosing-diplomacy/,"Is there even a single Duterte sycophant (DDS) who recognizes the irony of the “anti-war-peacenik-love-and-food-not-bombs” mantra they are trying to sell? That is quite rich coming from a bunch of bloodthirsty hyenas salivating at the prospect of a reboot of their demigod’s gory drug war. How about the narrative being peddled about the current president being a war freak who is trying to put our country into a proxy war with China on behalf of big bad Uncle Sam? It is as if we must ignore Chinese Commie aggressors blasting our people with powerful water cannons within our own Exclusive Economic Zonw (EEZ) and instead, make us believe that it is our government causing all the problems! Proxy war? How the heck is that a proxy war when we are directly being bullied and our rights are being trampled on by China right in our very own backyard? It’s quite amazing how the DDS mind works. Only one functional brain cell yet they manage to make so much noise.
So, anti-war, huh? Hugs for thugs. The DDS wants the Philippines to be “neutral” when it comes to the battle for dominance between America and China. Okay, well and good. But let’s assess what this “neutrality” actually means for us. Let’s suppose you are this 4’10” skinny middle-aged Filipina living alone peacefully in your little patch of house and lot. Then suddenly your next-door neighbor, a 6’1” 220-pound man in his 30s, decides to encroach on your property and take possession of a quarter of your space. Suppose that the jerk demands that you first ask for his permission whenever you plan to step on the quarter portion of your property that he stole? What are you going to do? Should you seek help from the barangay or the cops or even your friends and other neighbors in dealing with this guy or should you just submit to your bully neighbor? Using the DDS logic, the best way to deal with this situation is to simply yield to this big bully. Talk some senses into the guy and negotiate. Negotiate with what? You are not in a position of strength to dictate or even negotiate terms. If you even capitulate to your neighbor’s demand, that you only deal with him and not involve the barangay, the cops, or any other people, then you would be dumb to give away any leverage available for you to use in negotiating with the bully. You remain “neutral” by bending over backwards to the bully and not ask for help from others willing and able to help you? If this is what it means to be “neutral” for the DDS in our case then, good grief!
I am not a fan of jaundiced columnist and author, Richard Heydarian, but he does make an excellent point when he wrote:
Moreover, there are few things as preposterous as calling for neutrality in regional affairs, given that (i) we have a treaty alliance with one of the two superpowers and, even more importantly, (ii) we are directly embroiled in territorial disputes with China with a clear risk of direct confrontation. Allies can’t be neutral but, more crucially, we can’t be neutral in our own disputes! Bobo ba tayo? Third, the Duterte camp keeps on harping on the need for diplomacy. I completely agree, because that’s like saying “water is wet!” Of course, we need diplomacy, since no one wants war, including China. But diplomacy without any leverage is tantamount to capitulation. Only fools think that a rising hegemon will concede on territorial and maritime issues based on polite talk and subservience.”
Neutrality has historically been reduced into a mere buzzword when conflicts happen right at one’s doorstep! For instance, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium were all neutral prior to World War 2 yet Adolf Hitler still invaded these countries so that Hitler can proceed to attack one of his main targets – France! More recently, why do we think Sweden and Finland decided to abandon their neutrality and decided to join NATO? Hello?! Putin’s Russian army, which invaded Zelensky’s Ukraine, is right next door to them! The four remaining European neutral countries? Only Switzerland is currently standing firm on its neutrality! Why? As Franz-Stefan Gady of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said:
..it is only Switzerland that maintains relatively robust conventional defenses capable of fielding a credible military deterrent against a potential aggressor. Even though they are not part of NATO, Austria, Ireland, and Malta have de facto outsourced their territorial defense and security to the alliance, with the implicit expectation that it will come to their aid when needed.”
We should be like Switzerland as the Duterte sycophants said? Praytell, does the Philippines have a capable and credible military deterrent on its own against a powerful foreign aggressor like China? Anyway, with the close proximity of the Philippines to Taiwan, is it any wonder why China, known to be itching to invade what it considers to be its renegade province, wants to control areas within our territory or Exclusive Economic Zone? Heydarian pointed out:
In an event of invasion, the first 48 hours are extremely important, because that’s the window within which China will take advantage of its geographic proximity, and it will take some time before the American Navy Indo-Pacific Command, whether it’s in Hawaii or Guam, or in Japan, can respond to a major contingency, … That’s where the Philippines comes in.”
Indeed, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s (PBBM) view of the geopolitical situation in the South China Sea/West Philippine Sea is correct when he said:
When we look at the situation in the area, especially the tensions in the Taiwan Strait, we can see that just by our geographical location, should there in fact be conflict in that area … it’s very hard to imagine a scenario where the Philippines will not somehow get involved.”
So, will America support and fight for the Philippines in case war breaks out in the South China Sea that involves us? Duterte, a perennial America hater (going back to when he was said to have been denied an entry visa to the United States to visit a girlfriend), pontificates the idea that America won’t. Sure, we can grant him that idea of a possibility, but the question is: “Is it in America’s interest to welch on us?” Suppose America does welch on us and leave us twisting in the wind instead of honoring their mutual defense pact with us, what implications would that have with its defense pact with, say, Japan and South Korea? How will America’s credibility be impacted in terms of defense pacts with other nations? What would stop other countries where America has defense treaties with, like Japan and South Korea, from thinking twice about relying on America knowing that a nuclear psycho, Kim Jung Un, is right next door to them? Wouldn’t it be conceivable that these countries will start hyper-arming themselves which may very well kickstart another (nuclear) arms race that nobody wants?
The problem with the Dutertards is that very much like the sheep that they are, they simply swallow Duterte’s pro-China/anti-American vitriol hook line and sinkers. Again, being “neutral” and taking the China appeasement approach, is tantamount to that example of a 4’10” skinny middle-aged Filipina submitting to her neighbor bully’s aggression, encroachment, and terms, just in order to avoid angering the bully further. Why, in the fentanyl god’s name, should we not ask for help from other countries with similar values and interests if we are incapable of defending and asserting our rights by ourselves? Besides, by going into defense agreements with other like-minded countries, does that necessarily mean wanting to go to war with China? The Dutertards, with their one-dimensional thinking, seem to believe so. These dolts don’t seem to realize that the type of kumbaya diplomacy they are pushing our country to go for is essentially coming into the negotiating table in a position without any leverage. We don’t have any military capabilities for a credible defense posture, they don’t want us to involve powerful allies like the United States of America, they don’t want us to risk further riling up China by asserting our Arbitral Award when it comes to the West Philippine Sea, these geopolitical Einsteins are essentially China’s useful idiots helping the Chinese stack the cards against us! For what? To go back to the Duterte era of “good and respectful” relations with the Chinese? Hello?! Remember the time when a Chinese ship struck and sunk the Philippine fishing vessel Gimver 1 that almost killed all 22 of its crew members in June 2019? If not for the help of Vietnamese fishermen who picked up our compatriots in the middle of the ocean under darkness, we would have lost 22 Filipino souls! How about the other encroachment incidents during Duterte’s watch? In April 2019 the Chinese sent many ships near Philippine-occupied Pag-asa Island? Have we forgotten how tense that incident was? Remember the 200 Chinese ships that tried to again encroach within our EEZ at the Julian Felipe Reef back in March 2021? Did Duterte’s Chinese brown-nosing appeasement policies during his tenure demonstrate respect for Filipino rights and good faith on the part of the Chinese? Were these the goods we got from the “Secret Agreement” Duterte had with China?
Because of the failed policies of Duterte as well as the continued aggression and duplicity of the Chinese, PBBM was wise to move to change the country’s strategy. PBBM recognized that the traditional diplomatic ways in dealing with China has not and does not seem to work. He pointed out:
Well, [up] to this point, we have resorted to the traditional methods of diplomacy where, should there be an incident, we send [a] note verbale. Our embassy will send a démarche to the Foreign Affairs (Ministry) office in Beijing, but we have been doing this for many years now, with very little progress,

We have to do something that we have not done before. We have to come up with a new concept, a new principle, a new idea so that we move, as I say, we move the needle the other way. Let’s move the needle back, so that paradigm shift is something that we have to formulate.”
What was this new strategy? PBBM went on to engage with partners in the Indo-Pacific region and other countries from around the world to discuss about the Chinese challenge and for the Philippines’ partners to come up with a joint position. The result? There have been at least 18 countries that have expressed strong support for the Philippines against Chinese belligerence and blatant disrespect for the Rule of Law. Just this month, no less than the G7 nations expressed strong support for us and against China’s aggressive use of coast guard and maritime militia in the disputed areas of the South China Sea, as well as its obstruction of neighboring countries’ freedom of navigation. PBBM has effectively isolated China from the world and has used its relationship with like-minded countries it shares common interests with, as leverage in the negotiating table. Now that more countries have outwardly shown disapproval of Chinese aggression and expansionism, China has found itself in a losing face situation. In Chinese culture, the concept of face is very important as it is tied with public image and honor. As the website Pandanese has shared:
In Chinese culture, losing and gaining face are ingrained in everyday life. To gain ‘face’ or respect from others, you must keep their dignity intact while also avoiding embarrassment and preserving dignity in yourself to not lose your social standing in your peer group or society. China has embraced this concept tightly, using it as a self-regulating system to avoid embarrassment and negative repercussions should anyone fail morally: broken relationships, tarnished reputation, and compromised social status, outward appearances being some examples. … Losing face can lead to disastrous outcomes for your reputation.”
In addition to our newly acquired leverage of having the ability to diminish China’s image or make it lose face, PBBM has also effectively shown that the Philippines does have other cards on the table that China needs to respect. For instance, the Philippines has allowed its allies to place missile systems in the Philippines, acquired modern military weapons and ships, and further beefed up current military bases where American military is allowed to use through the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Of course, these are not meant to threaten to attack China but to send a message that at least the Philippines has options in making things difficult, if not potentially devastating, for China’s hegemonic ambitions should it continue to proceed with its aggression towards us. PBBM’s strategy has resulted in reminding China that we do not want war with them, but should they continue to jerk us around we do have options at our disposal to make things quite damaging for them, not only for their reputation but also militarily which of course boils down to financial repercussions. That is leverage and PBBM’s strategy of having leverage is certainly a lot better than Duterte’s submissive Chinese brown-nosing policy where we are coming into the negotiating table in a position of weakness.
It is really quite amazing how Dutertards don’t seem to understand how diplomacy and negotiations work. One would think that engaging in diplomacy with leverage is common sense, right? However, for the Duterte cultists, it seems that sense is not necessarily common amongst them.  We have to marvel at how these Duterte cultists have become quite the unwitting Judases that they are. One thing seems clear, if our country were a house, these DDS bunch will be rooting for the termites!",Politics
Boo for Pop Culture Racism but Hooray for Economic Bigotry!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/03/boo-for-pop-culture-racism-but-hooray-for-economic-bigotry/,"Remember the time when Filipinos read about this e-mail chain, that supposedly came from a Filipino tabloid spread, which tells of Tommy Hilfiger purportedly saying that had he known that Black people and Asians would buy his clothes, he never would have made them so nice? How about the time when Teri Hatcher’s character in the hit show Desperate Housewives said, “Can I check those diplomas? Because I want to make sure they’re not from some med school in the Philippines!”? Then of course, how about that time when Will Ferrel’s character in the movie, ‘Anchor Man 2’ said that the “Only Olympic sport Filipinos are good at is eating cats and dogs.”? Notice that even though the Hilfiger email was a hoax and that Hatcher’s and Ferrel’s lines were just from some stupid comedy shows, Filipinos are so quick to get riled up for being victimized by what they perceive as “racism”. So, I wonder how Filipinos feel about themselves being racist against foreigners when it comes to business?
The latest Pulse Asia survey result seems to suggest that when it comes to lifting foreign ownership restrictions in the 1987 Constitution, for Filipinos, it is A-Ok to discriminate based on race or ethnicity. Never mind that the survey also revealed that 75% to 79% of Filipinos have little or no knowledge about the 1987 Constitution at all, it begs to ask: “Do Filipinos in the Philippines even know what they like about the present Charter regarding economic foreign ownership restrictions?” I mean do their lives suck less if their boss is a “De la Cruz” rather than a “Gupta”, an “Abdhullahi”, a “Kobayashi”, a “Smith” or a “Brzezinski”?
The 1987 Constitution is “supposed” to guarantee the protection of rights and freedoms under the “Equal Protection Clause”. This means, in theory, that:
“No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.”
Now, of course this is entirely theoretical in nature because let’s face it, if you’re just a two-bit Totoy Pototoy, do you really think you can ever be equal in the eyes of the law if you are up against an Ayala, a Villar, a Marcos, or a Duterte? When was the last time you heard a Duterte defend a two-bit punk for suspected use and sale of drugs on the street? However, I do know at least one Duterte who has passionately defended someone filthy rich indicted for conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion and sex trafficking of children; conspiracy; and bulk cash smuggling. Well, at least for narcotics use and peddling as well as fraud and sex crimes, the law affords people to pretend that there is equality. However, when it comes to business, the law of the Philippines does not make any bones about its discriminatory trait! Supporting jurisprudence states that:
“The equal protection of the law clause is against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality. It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited either [by] the object to which it is directed or by [the] territory within which it is to operate. It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced. The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable. grounds exist for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.”
The reason why foreigners have so many restrictions in doing business in the Philippines is because foreigners are not deemed as equals among Filipinos in the Philippines. Under the law, preferential treatment is given to Filipinos and foreigners cannot demand equality with them! Under the current law, the following are examples of restrictions that apply to foreigners:
1. Foreigners are not allowed to own a business under a Sole Proprietorship structure
2. Foreigners are only allowed up to 40% ownership in a Partnership business structure
3. Foreigners are only allowed up to 40% ownership in a corporation
4. Foreigners are not allowed to have equity on small-scale mining
5. Foreigners are not allowed to have equity on practice of professions
6. Foreigners are only allowed 20% equity on private radio communication network
7. Foreigners are only allowed 25% equity on construction and repair of locally-funded public works (except infrastructure/development projects covered under RA 7718)
8. Foreigners are only allowed 40% equity on educational institutions
9. Foreigners are only allowed 40% equity on businesses focused on culture, production, milling, processing, trading excepting retailing, of rice and corn and acquiring, by barter, purchase or otherwise, rice and corn and the byproducts thereof
10. Foreigners are only allowed 40% equity on businesses focused on the supply of materials, goods and commodities to government owned or controlled corporation, company, agency or Municipal Corporation.
Now if you are a foreign investor, would you be willing to invest your hard-earned money in a foreign environment where you absorb high risk in exchange for a very limited return, while being deemed as an inferior under the law?
Let’s face it, the free flow of capital is more attractive for investors because any business worth it’s salt would seek out the conditions that would give it the highest rate of return! As IMF’s international relations and economic gurus Prakash Loungani and Assaf Razin noted:
“Unrestricted capital flows may also offer several other advantages, as noted by Feldstein (2000). First, international flows of capital reduce the risk faced by owners of capital by allowing them to diversify their lending and investment. Second, the global integration of capital markets can contribute to the spread of best practices in corporate governance, accounting rules, and legal traditions. Third, the global mobility of capital limits the ability of governments to pursue bad policies.”
Moreover, the gains to host countries from FDI mean:
• FDI allows the transfer of technology—particularly in the form of new varieties of capital inputs—that cannot be achieved through financial investments or trade in goods and services. FDI can also promote competition in the domestic input market.
• Recipients of FDI often gain employee training in the course of operating the new businesses, which contributes to human capital development in the host country.
• Profits generated by FDI contribute to corporate tax revenues in the host country.
Pray tell, with Filipinos being majority holders of business equity under current Philippine laws, in comparison to many progressive countries, how is the Philippines doing in terms of industry, science, and technology? Educational performance? The quality of local media entertainment, even?
What result did Filipino economic protectionism provide in terms of the Filipino people’s income per capita? Labor force participation rate? Employment and underemployment rate? Don’t you wonder why many Filipinos dream of leaving the country? Again, do Filipino lives in the Philippines suck less if their boss is a “De la Cruz” rather than a “Gupta”, an “Abdhullahi”, a “Kobayashi”, a “Smith” or a “Brzezinski”?
A truly free market system limits restrictions to a very miniscule minimum, if a full lifting of restriction is prohibited at all. But do we really want to impose restrictions on foreign equity in businesses out of mere jingoistic sentiments or are we serving unwittingly as useful idiots to local oligarchs who are afraid of free market competition? Don’t we want a world where assets are put to their most productive and valuable use rather than being held indefinitely by its richest citizens? Where efficient resource allocation, competition, innovation, and product variety flourish? These things are the fruits of a truly free market system which translate to better quality and cheaper products and services. Why would anyone in their right mind want to shun a good opportunity to at least best approximate these ideals through the proposed economic changes in the Constitution just because a jaundiced and leftist partisan says so or a hysterical blowhard Davao demigod cusses against it?
Well, with the way the economic Charter Change is being politically painted, Filipinos will continue to be stuck with the status quo. So down with fashion designers and Hollywood for discriminating against us but hey, if the color of your skin and if your ethnicity is different from a Filipino’s, then it is perfectly fine to look at you as an inferior. Wow! Quite a show of duplicity! Boo for pop culture racism, but hooray for economic bigotry.",Politics
An alliance between the Yellowtards and the Marcos dynasty forms the Philippines’ new ruling oligarchy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/an-alliance-between-the-yellowtards-and-the-marcos-dynasty-forms-the-philippines-new-ruling-oligarchy/,"In his Inquirer piece “Media, politics, and foreign relations”, columnist Randy David illuminates the recent media re-circus surrounding President Bongbong Marcos’s alleged history of drug use…
It must have taken no small amount of pressure by the former president to get [Senator Ronald “Bato”] Dela Rosa, his erstwhile police chief, to initiate an investigation into an alleged cocaine session involving Mr. Marcos that supposedly happened 12 years ago. Well, the senator is seeking re-election, and he may have been inveigled into thinking the Senate investigation could give him media exposure. But how to make something musty newsworthy again—that was the challenge. The new spin had to come from something previously unreported. That is where movie actress Maricel Soriano, in whose condo the 2012 cocaine session was supposed to have taken place, came in. Soriano’s appearance at the hearing—and whatever else her supposed link to Mr. Marcos might suggest—was more than enough to land Dela Rosa’s investigation in the news.
Perhaps just the most recent of his small contributions to efforts to undermine the credibility of the current admin but, in this one, David misses the real issue which is the performance of the Marcos administration thus far. You can’t help but think that his mindset is Marcos is the lesser evil when compared to the “demonic” former President Rodrigo Duterte, which is why he makes light of the accusation of drug use and the brouhaha over the mess of the secret agreement, initially being pinned on Duterte and what appears to be now, another one by the Marcos administration with the Chinese.
Marcos’ cocaine use is the worst kept secret in the alta sociedad of Manila. This began back in the day when they lorded it over Manila’s social set, with their extended barkada of children of Marcos government officials and cronies. It’s old news. The only issue which makes it relevant is how it can be tied in to the prevalence of drugs during the administration the late former President Noynoy Aquino, seemingly under the protection of its highest officials, all the way to Malacañan, which many have linked to the death of then Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Jesse Robredo and the filing of charges against its former Justice Secretary, Leila De Lima.
Robredo had been building up dossiers on government officials involved in illegal drugs and gambling. This was found out by Undersecretary Rico Puno who belonged to the Samar faction in the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. It was precisely the reason why he was given that appointment. The dossiers were part of Jesse’s grand strategy to become President in 2016.
One of the sterling traits of Yellowidiots is hypocrisy. The fact that Marcos is pro-US and intends to demolish the Duterte brand is enough common ground for the Yellowidiots to stop branding Marcos as a thief. They implore him to give the victims of the drug war justice by handing Duterte over to the International Criminal Court (ICC), if and when the time comes. The Araneta family to which First Lady Marie Louise “Liza” Araneta Marcos (née Marie Louise Cacho Araneta) is more Yellow than pro-Marcos which is another reason why the Yellowidiots have hope.
Those who voted for the UniTeam didn’t expect this to happen. They were looking forward to an end to political divisiveness. Unfortunately, what we have now is more of the same. The optics are excellent in the Marcos administration but governance is sorely lacking and while government working with the private sector should be a positive development, the signs are there that this is just another specie in the evolution of cronyism, which never actually became extinct, even if the late former President Cory Aquino said she would put a stop to it.
Perhaps this is why Globe Telecom is brazen enough to slap a transaction fee even if you’re transferring money from your BPI account to your GCash account or simply buying load for your Globe prepaid SIM. Pati yung limang piso o piso di pa pinatawad.
This is why critical thinking Filipinos aren’t enamored of the excellent optics and the press releases churned out by the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) about all the good Marcos is doing. They long for Duterte who protected them from such abuse by the oligarchs. You get the impression that Marcos is weak and the reason why that is so is because you know he’s not the only one making decisions of national importance. The leadership is a triumvirate of the president, the wife and the cousin. What will become of the country with the unholy alliance between the Marcos’ and the Yellowidiots?

The Philippines’ hollow no-substance political leaders and alliances hinders its development,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/the-philippines-hollow-no-substance-political-leaders-and-alliances-hinders-its-development/,"In his recent piece “Ideology, anyone?”, Manila Standard columnist Lito Banayo hits upon a key reason why we are not as progressive as our ASEAN neighbors. Banayo gets to the core of why the “Unity” theme of the current administration of President Bongbong Marcos (PBbM) is in a death spiral sharing a conversation he picked up in one the lunch meetings he attends weekly…
The reason he advanced [behind why “the UniTeam is now all but dead”] was that the “alliance” between PBbM and ISZDC in 2022 was not based on any ideology or common principles, but was purely for purposes of electoral victory.
To which an incumbent governor, our lunch group’s resident “pilosopo” who always has something to say about anything, mostly street smart quips though based on a good reading of political history, retorted: “Meron bang ideology sa Pilipinas? Komunista lang ang may ideology.”
Almost everybody in our lunch group agreed with undisguised glee to his quip.
Indeed, as Banayo eloquently highlights, our political leaders don’t have ideological underpinnings. PBBM’s father, the late former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, was the only president who attempted to provide it through his Bagong Lipunan (New Society) Movement. Alas Marcos Sr. also fell short because his industrialization program was dragged down by the US recession and, at that time, there were no other financing alternatives aside from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (IMF-WB).
Since 1986, the pattern has been the revolving door between the defeated party and the party in power. Witness how Singapore has been progressive since its separation from Malaysia. Why? Their late former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew got rid of the communists. Then he proceeded to lay down his vision of what Singapore should be and what a Singaporean is. For all intents and purposes, Singapore is a benevolent dictatorship but the formula has proven successful. Today, Singapore has a new prime minister in the person of Lawrence Wong. The consistency and stability of Singapore is the main reason why it’s progressive despite its size.
In contrast, our politics is driven by money and power. We haven’t moved on from the feudalism of the Spanish period. The friars were replaced by political lords instead. Even American democracy was largely ineffective because the colonists used the ruling class to rule over the greater majority. After World War II, the elites focused on rebuilding their fortunes and this has been the case up to to this day. Old oligarchs have died and their fortunes dissipated only to be replaced by new ones.
This is why we are, today, scraping the bottom of the barrel as far as leaders are concerned. The system bred mediocrity and we are now at that point where the leading presidential contender barely has the credentials and the competence to lead. Can Vice President Inday Sara Duterte and Senator Raffy Tulfo, be even considered real leadership choices? It’s about time we wake up to the reality that the only way for change to come is if the revolution begins with the Filipino people and in the way that they think.",Politics
Why is Filipino “patriotism” so CRINGE?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/why-is-filipino-patriotism-so-cringe/,"One is consistently hard-pressed to get an authentic stand-up-and-put-hand-on-heart-with-welling-eyes vibe when called to emit a bit of patriotic signals for the Philippines. The latest such attempt to reel in some “love of country” sentiment comes in the form of an all-too-familiar “people power” stunt pulled by “non-government coalition” Atin Ito (“this is ours”) which set out to send that message to China through, the Associated Press reports, a flotilla of “100 Filipino activists on wooden boats” aiming to “distribute food packs and fuel to Filipino fishermen about 58 nautical miles (107 kilometers) southeast of Scarborough Shoal and then sail back home”.
Media reports point to a certain Rafaela David, President of militant Akbayan Party as the “lead convenor” of the coalition. In what is evidently a “report” that echoes the Chinese government’s position on all matters South China Sea, Global Times described the stunt as a “plan to stir up trouble” and its organiser a “hired gun” of the United States’ military.
Although it publicly claims to be an independent Philippine organization pursuing peace, the actions of the Atin Ito coalition are more akin to a “hired gun” serving the US strategy in the South China Sea. In fact, its ability to coordinate resources within the Philippines, as well as its intricate relationships with pro-American figures in the US military and Filipino politics, all highlight that it is far from a simple Filipino civil organization.
Interestingly, the “hired gun” of the US allegation issued by the Chinese is ironic considering that Akbayan traces its roots to the Philippines’ Communist Party which, through its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (in a force widely dubbed the “CPP-NPA”) had for decades been waging a violent “revolution” to topple the Government.
Considering too that Global Times cites how “Philippine naval vessels or Philippine Coast Guard vessels were also often seen accompanying Atin Ito’s activities in their previous activities in the South China Sea”, it is worth noting that Akbayan is staunchly opposed to the administration of President Bongbong Marcos and had, in fact campaigned hard to have Marcos disqualified from the 2022 national elections.
The political agendas that underlie these spectacles are the least of what is disturbing here. The more notable point here is just how pathetic such displays are. “Patriotism” in the Philippines is traditionally a victimhood appeal and not one that revolves around a true fight for the country’s sovereign identity. In the specific case of this Atin Ito stunt, the sight of “wooden boats” and wretched fishermen being placed before the Goliath is unlikely — and likely not intended — to move China.  Rather, this is but another one of those habitual practice of provoking a response that would then be framed as the actions of a “bully”. Thus explains the presence of those “journalists on four boats” accompanying these activists reported by AP.
The Chinese evidently don’t understand the core nature of Filipinos. In the Philippines things happen really more all for show. Personal convictions hardly ever form part the major part of what motivates any sort of Filipino undertaking. This is why no progress of true substance sets in in Philippine society. All we get is a resounding national cringe whenever we get a load of these circuses.",Politics
"Terror, Duterte Style Rule of Panglao Mayor Drives Tourists Away During Peak Season",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/terror-duterte-style-rule-of-panglao-mayor-drives-tourists-away-during-peak-season/,"More than three hundred guests and employees of Villa Tomasa Alona Kew Resort in Panglao, Bohol remain in shock more than a week after it was allegedly shutdown by force by Mayor Edgardo “Boy” Arcay.
Smartphone video footage taken by someone inside the resort shows dozens of police in battlegear and men armed with shotguns entering the Villa Tomasa Alona Kew resort led by someone who looks like Mayor Arcay.
More video footage from inside the resort show people huddled together crying in apparent fright and also reveal guests or employees groping around in its hallways after the resort’s power was cut.
A man with a megaphone accompanied by several others was also recorded on video blaring announcements that the resort had been closed and orders for people to leave immediately as men with shotguns roamed the resort.
The incident has reportedly scared off tourists from visiting Panglao and brought about booking cancellations as a result of the threatening closure of the resort.
In a statement by the resort’s management published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, it said, ““We, the management of the Villa Tomasa- Alona Kew Hotel Resort, have expressed fear and utmost disappointment to the recent action taken by some individuals headed by Panglao, Bohol Mayor Edgardo “Boy” Arcay for using excessive force to close out their resort two weeks ago.”
As reported in other national and local newspapers, it was said that Panglao Mayor Arcay refused to approve permits for Villa Tomasa for reasons not specified by the mayor.
Villa Tomasa still has still four years left from the five-year lease agreement and had presumably made substantial investments into the resort.
A source claims that Arcay’s refusal to grant permits may be politically motivated and may be favoring another business entity, thus perhaps prompting the resort’s legal team to state:
“The management also warns unscrupulous individuals who will be taking advantage of the resort’s current situation not to go to any negotiations without the full knowledge of the owner of the Villa Tomasa-Alona Kew Hotel Resort.”

As a result of the reportedly violent closure of the resort, criminal as well as administrative complaints have been filed against Mayor Arcay and those who implemented his orders.
According to one of several complaints filed, the allegations include “Kidnapping and Serious Illegal detention, Violation of the Anti Terror Law, Robbery by band, Grave Coercion”.
So far, there are no reports regarding the response of the Mayor Arcay and those named in the complaints.
The DILG has been expected to issue a statement regarding the violent closure of the resort but has remained silent. This has prompted observers from Panglao as well as other areas to question on social media the department’s lack of concern over the use of excessive force that terrorized tourists and possibly damaged the country’s reputation as a tourist destination.",Politics
US propaganda continues to be parroted by Rappler “thought leaders”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/us-propaganda-continues-to-be-parroted-by-rappler-thought-leaders/,"It’s important to the Americans that the Duterte brand in Philippine politics be destroyed since it advocates for an independent foreign policy. Witness how we have become the outlier in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) community.
Among the original founding members, we are only ahead of Cambodia and Laos while Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are enjoying economic progress and cooperating with China, which is ASEAN’s largest trading partner.
Still, the Philippines’ liberal “thought leaders” stick to their guns in echoing the sentiments of their Western patrons. In her recent Rappler piece “‘Unrequited Love’: Why Filipinos should hold Duterte accountable for his China pivot”, Bea Cupin plug-gushes all about her pals’ new book Unrequited Love: Duterte’s China Embrace where its authors Marites Vitug and Camille Elemia “chronicle just how enamored Duterte was over China – and how both Filipino citizens and those in government successfully pushed back”.
Cupin “reports” on a panel discussion chaired by former Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio whom she describes as “the Philippines’ leading legal expert on the West Philippine Sea [a.k.a. South China Sea]”.
“Duterte remained popular, I think, because the Filipino people are not blaming Duterte for the actions of China. They are blaming China. We have not been successful so far in explaining to the people that Duterte is also responsible for that,” said Carpio on Thursday, June 18, in a panel discussion on Marites Vitug and Camille Elemia’s new book, Unrequited Love: Duterte’s China Embrace.
Indeed, we have become the mouthpiece of the “rights based international order” in the region, as the Rappler mob demonstrates above. Trouble is, ASEAN isn’t having any of that because each of its other members’ leaders understand the present geopolitical realities well and are acting in their country’s best interests.
America is laden with debt because of its deficits, arising from its continued hegemony. It can’t keep on spending for wars it keeps losing. But China has bridged the technological gap. It dominates manufacturing globally and has successfully built automated plants producing electric vehicles and tech hardware such as computers and smartphones. It is making inroads in software with Harmony OS. It dominates telecoms technology. It is now the biggest shipbuilder in the world. It’s about to become the largest carmaker as well.
We are the only ASEAN member country hostile to China. Vietnam has territorial disputes with China but engages in active dialogue through diplomacy. The claim that Duterte sold us out is the narrative of our pro-America politicians who support the policy of the Philippines being Uncle Sam’s pawn in the region.
Make no mistake about it, China will not hesitate to defend its interests if the Americans continue with their strategy of using the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia as its regional lackeys with the formation of an Indo-Pacific NATO.

"Philippine Senate inquiries are dishonest circuses, not conducted in aid of legislation",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/08/philippine-senate-inquiries-are-dishonest-circuses-not-conducted-in-aid-of-legislation/,"In his recent Inquirer piece “A tale of two chambers” Manuel L. Quezon III questions the assiduousness of the present Senate. It’s a praise piece for Senators Risa Hontiveros and Sherwin Gatchalian, the now renowned Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) crusaders, as they have styled themselves, even if their committees which conduct the “hearings” have turned into kangaroo courts, with both pronouncing the guilt of embattled Bamban Alice Guo, on the basis of the “evidence” they have uncovered.
MLQ3 writes…
It’s been interesting to compare the current Senate investigations into Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) spearheaded by Sen. Risa Hontiveros to the parallel investigation going on in the House which has made a bit of a folk hero of Batangas Rep. Gerville Luistro. The House, to my mind, seems, for once, to be demonstrating some pretty effective teamwork which means there is good coaching going on behind the scenes.
Aficionados of investigations point to the satisfying manner in which police officials, for example, have been asked about their work and the people they deal with, only for the police officials to be confronted, at the end of their testimony, with pictures and videos demolishing the claims they’d just made. Even the manner in which Harry Roque was brought to heel, from being rather pleased with himself to becoming thoroughly entangled in his own evasions and contradictions, was outstanding.
Funny thing is, it’s the judiciary which determines the probity of the evidence and the guilt of the accused. It makes you question what the Senate has turned into, when its primary purpose is legislation. The bete noir of the Yellowidiots couldn’t resist taking a swipe at Sen. Ronald ‘Bato’ dela Rosa’s proposal for a law to ban the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the country. It’s actually stupid and you wonder if Bato really had the balls. Of course, no Senator has come out in support of his proposal and what’s good for Santa Saba Leila (De Lima) is also good for Bato, going by MLQ3’s logic. Fair enough. Bato should have balls because he does have balls. Leila has balls because she eats men’s balls for breakfast. Maybe lunch and dinner as well, given the testimony of her security escorts.
The Senate has actually turned into a circus. It used to be that it would not pass up the opportunity to investigate a sitting president. Former President Joseph ‘Erap’ Estrada was tried by the Senate. During the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA), it conducted several hearings into alleged anomalies which earned GMA the title of the most unpopular president. But witness how the present crop of Senators whitewashed the investigation of Bato’s committee about the drug use of the president and the diamond star. This is in stark contrast to Hontiveros forcibly linking Alice Guo to Duterte. The same is true with Harry Roque and his legal sleight of hand with the arrest of the foreigners renting his house in Tuba. I don’t know about you but this makes me puke.
There isn’t any reason to vote for Senators in the midterm election. Each of them cost taxpayers about P400M a year. Their new building’s cost is at P23B and counting. While we’re at it, the house of representathieves should be abolished as well. Most, if not all, of the congressmen are legitimized criminals addressed as “honorable”. The present state of our country is such that a revolution can easily be launched. But the main drawback is we are stupid Filipinos who continue to put up with the shenanigans of our elected officials.
We get the government we deserve and this is why most of our regional neighbors see us as a joke. When do we put an end to this?",Politics
Duterte clan being painted as the “privileged” camp to make their enemies look good,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/duterte-clan-being-painted-as-the-privileged-camp-to-make-their-enemies-look-good/,"The Dutertes and their allies are the privileged ones in Inquirer columnist Randy David’s book. He writes in his recent piece how “I cringe each time the treatment of [Vice President Inday Sara] Duterte is compared to the treatment of former vice president Leni Robredo under the Duterte presidency.”
VP Sara was given the privilege of resigning from her post as education secretary at a time of her own choosing. Leni was simply told that her presence at Cabinet meetings was henceforth no longer needed. In short, she was rudely fired from her post as housing secretary. During her six-year term as vice president, Leni always came prepared to defend her office’s budget. Knowing that she was from the opposition, she never grumbled.
Never mind that their political party has been abandoned by its members, as they have transferred to either Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats or Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP), because these are the parties in power. No oligarch supports them because former President Rodrigo Duterte (PRRD) kept the oligarchs in line during his watch. He cut off their legs at the knees and made sure they toed his line.
Despite claims of corruption, I doubt very much the Dutertes have a war chest on the same scale as the Marcoses. In the same manner that Duterte didn’t have much campaign funds in 2015, the same is true again because they have gone back to being outliers. They are not alta, as one “influencer” of the administration put it. No civilidad nor urbanidad as the Spanish would say.
The Marcos-Araneta-Romualdez combine, the Yellowidiots, and the leftist-militant-liberal bohemians are more acceptable to the current administration of President Bongbong Marcos. They have joined forces, albeit indirectly, to bury the Duterte political brand in the political graveyard. It was Inday Sara who brought this on her family by not listening to the counsel of the patriarch. The predicate is being laid for PRRD and his cohorts to be handed over to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Inday is being threatened with impeachment and their staunchest ally, the anointed “son of god” Apollo Quiboloy, is on the run. Their enemies are gleefully writing their epitaph.
But I won’t write them off just yet. I will wait until May 2025. By that time, their fate will become known. PRRD is in the fight of his life now. This is larger than the presidency in 2016. It is for his family’s survival. It is an existential crisis of humongous proportions.",Politics
Midterm Elections 2025: the coveted prize in the Yellowtards’ scramble to take down the Dutertes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/08/midterm-elections-2025-the-coveted-prize-in-the-yellowtards-scramble-to-take-down-the-dutertes/,"In his Inquirer piece “And then there were none” published today, Manuel L Quezon III writes the obituary of the Dutertes as a political force. Question is, is he right or wrong? His basis is the inability of Duterte to muster crowds of people against the administration of President Bongbong Marcos.
Here is MLQ3 looks for parallels in the recent efforts to muster an outraged crowd to support the plight of embattled Pastor Apollo Quiboloy who is a close personal friend of former President Rodrigo Duterte…
It may be that the seemingly pitiful few—pitiful in the sense not only of their loyalty to their disgraced cult leader hiding in a bunker, but pitiful in the sense of the tens of thousands that were assumed to be at Quiboloy’s beck and call politically—gathered in Davao, at the Liwasang Bonifacio (where they withdrew after banging on the shut security gates at Chino Roces Bridge) and elsewhere, are doing so out of heartbroken devotion. But they are the last gasps of a phenomenon that has slowly been extinguished over the past two decades.
But is Duterte seeking that or merely his minions posturing for the public in aid of election in 2025? I think it’s too early to write the Dutertes off given his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte still leads the polling for 2028, even in the midst of the demolition job against her and her family. The piece is more than likely, a product of MLQ3’s wet dream; that he who wrought the most damage to the Yellowidiots and their leftist-militant allies would be left standing alone, ranged up the enemies he created, now including his erstwhile allies, the Marcoses. But see here’s the thing, the patriarch former president never thought of the Marcoses as his allies. Probably Bongbong’s sister Imee personally, but not the crown prince (now the king) himself.
What we have now in effect, is a political monarchy. It is not a republic. Critical thinkers can’t help but notice the lack of leadership, the gravitas and the political will that was all associated with Duterte (PRRD) when he was president. I believe PRRD is just biding his time and will come out once he feels that public opinion is ripe for the picking. Inday Sara is slowly making her break with the Marcoses but she is still not a chip off the old block. She is her own person. She’s now going through the biggest challenge in her political life which is of her own making.
The Dutertes don’t have the money and the power the administration has and their backs are against the wall. Their last stand will probably happen between October 2024 through May 2025. The midterm election has always been the anticipated referendum for any post-Marcos administration. We now have the Second Marcos Administration in place. It is nowhere near the first in terms of quality.
Duterte always said that the presidency is divine will. Perhaps the last chapter in the history of the Marcoses is not about their battle with those who forced them out in 1986, but those who paved the way for the realization of their goal to see the son follow in the footsteps of his father.",Politics

Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez was invited to be the guest of honor at the USMC Washington Evening Parade where the Philippine flag was raised — the first time a foreign flag was honored since 1957. The Marine Band also performed the Philippine national anthem twice, for the foreign colors and as musical honors for the Ambassador.
Ambassador Romualdez’s attendance at the Evening Parade symbolizes the continuing friendship and cooperation between the Philippines and the United States. This honor comes as the Ambassador returns from Manila, where he participated in the 2+2 bilateral meeting last July 30. During this meeting, both countries reaffirmed the importance of the ironclad Philippines-US alliance. The discussions led to a US$500 million commitment in foreign military financing from the 2024 Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, earmarked for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
This financial support underscores the depth of the Philippines-US partnership, which is rooted in key agreements such as the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951, the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998, and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement of 2014.
Philippine and US Marines remain steadfast in their commitment to advancing regional security and stability while enhancing collective military readiness. This commitment is displayed through the recent participation of Filipino Marines at the 2024 Rim of the Pacific Exercise, 2024 Marine Aviation Support Activity (MASA) littoral live fire exercise, and Exercise Balikatan 24, and most prominently, the KAMANDAG exercises, which have been held annually since 2016.
Furthermore, the Philippine Marine Corps and the US Marine Forces Pacific will co-host the 2025 in the Pacific Amphibious Leaders Symposium, where 32 countries are scheduled to unite and discuss the enhancement of maritime security in the region.
Ambassador Romualdez has been the Philippine ambassador to the US since the Duterte administration, a feat that gives him a unique and deep understanding of PH US ties that many say will redound to the smooth continuation of US foreign policy in Asia even as it transitions to a new administration after its elections this year.

Why make being an oligarchy sound like such a bad thing?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/why-make-being-an-oligarchy-sound-like-such-a-bad-thing/,"Think what you may of the administration of President Bongbong Marcos. Whether you are a Dutertard or a Yellowtard, one thing’s certain: the Marcos presidency had single-handedly neutralised two polar camps of rabid cults of personality.
The Yellowtards — worshippers of the clan of accidental “national hero” Ninoy Aquino — are now reduced to a confused lot seeing no choice (thanks to their thought leaders’ deficit of imagination) but to settle into an alliance of convenience with the Marcos family and their extended circle of cronies and clansmen. The Yellowtards after all count amongst their lot the chi chi characters who share country club memberships with chieftains of the ruling clan. They share more common ground with the Marcoses than petty ideological differences can spice over to the point that their now-obsolete shrill spiel of vilifying the “former dictator” is but a quaint historical curiosity.
The Dutertes, for their part, had also been taken for a ride. Former President Rodrigo Duterte helped bury the presidential dad, the “former dictator”, at the hallowed Libingan ng mga Bayani during his administration and then had to step back and watch his daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte, infuse Marcos Junior’s bid for power in 2022 with their then-potent political capital. All of that capital had since all been squandered by the VP owing to her  infantile behaviour over the last couple of years and the abject incompetence of her handlers.
The Marcos administration is an unabashedly oligarchic regime. Why make being an oligarchy sound like such a bad thing when Filipinos, after all, are comfy with being ruled by oligarchs? In a sense, the Second Marcos regime is authentic in form, messaging, and execution. Filipinos are happy to assume the familiar position to be profited off from and an unapologetically-oligarchic regime is happy to oblige and make a song and dance about its privileged place in society. Good optics, an entertained public, and money sloshing around the economy. It’s a win-win situation!
Philippine politics has never been in such authentic form since the “former dictator” was “ousted” in a “people power revolution” in 1986. It’s come full circle and settled back into its natural feudal state of willing sheep moving to the beat set by shrewd politico-entrepreneurs. To be fair it is all the same, except that pretending to be altruistic “revolutionaries” or “reformists” no longer works like the proverbial sheep’s clothing once did for would-be oppositionists.
The self-described “radical chick” Katrina Stuart-Santiago, one of the more sound of mind of the “thought leaders” of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis handily articulates the ideological conundrum her camp find themselves in these days — being in an uncomfortable bed with the Son of the Dictator — in her piece, “How are we under this Marcos presidency?”…
Is this a swing to BBM? It is not. It is an acknowledgment that right here, right now, we are taking our time in figuring out what to do next. It is an acknowledgment of this particular period, when many of us might be saying quietly to the people we trust: this feels more like a PNoy presidency than anything else.
Yes, neo-liberal policies and American loyalty included; yes, only-son-swagger and all-boys-school breeding included. The difference of course is that while PNoy’s government layered this with elitism, BBM’s leadership is devoid of the same. Instead, there is good ol’ Marcos mass appeal. There is a rhetoric that speaks to the masses, cutting across the Presidency to the presidential sister in the Senate; there are visits to communities in need, giveaways of land titles, ayuda at scale. There is also arts and culture, Malacañang concerts and free puto-bongbong at simbang gabi. There is content and propaganda showing him in his pambahay, eating Jollibee. There are welcome ambush interviews with media, and there is a sense of humor.
It remains to be seen, however, whether that respite and space to think that Stuart-Santiago imagines as an opportunity presented by the Second Marcos Regime to her people to “to try and affect electoral outcomes” will actually translate to said hoped-for outcomes. Space to think, after all, does not necessarily foment substantial thinking in Philippine society much less its stunted politics.",Politics
The idiotic “EDSA people power” frame Filipino thought leaders apply to analysing world events,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/the-idiotic-edsa-people-power-frame-filipino-thought-leaders-apply-to-analysing-world-events/,"Filipino thought leaders always jump at every opportunity to apply their favorite “people power” frame to personal thoughts on current events that they share. Inquirer columnist Randy David, for one, still believes in people power and expounds on this in his piece “South Korea’s ‘Edsa Tres’ moment” where he highlights a key insight…
South Korea’s current political crisis bears echoes of these Philippine episodes but diverges in significant ways. Where the Philippines often turned to mass mobilizations to decide outcomes, South Korea’s institutions—the National Assembly, Constitutional Court, and CIO—are at the forefront. And, so far, the military leadership has not shown any sign that it is about to take sides or intervene. This institutional approach may have its limitations, but it underscores the value of giving legal and procedural norms and processes a chance to work, even amid political turmoil.
David doesn’t want to admit that what the Yellowidiots refer to as Edsa 1 and 2 were nothing more than successful coup attempts. This is why I wonder why the moron anchors of SMNI, the media organisation loyal to former President Rodrigo Duterte, call for protests at the People Power shrine when Duterte largely downplayed EDSA people power celebrations because of their divisiveness.
Any move to oust the present administration is not and will not be people power. It will be a coup d’etat. This is the main defect of our political system which is why I still believe that a parliamentary system of government is best for the Philippines as it is the norm in the region also. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister can be ousted by a no-confidence vote, which triggers new elections, or the selection of a replacement among the ranks of current members of parliament. Our system doesn’t allow this and we’re stuck with a president who can continue to do more harm as he finishes his six years term.
The other challenge in our case is the fact that our lawmakers are bereft of honesty and integrity. They are easily bought off. The South Korean mindset, as explained by someone who deals with them on a regular basis, is to act with a sense of urgency. This is why they were able to mobilize quickly in Seoul to protest against the actions of the president and pressure the military into submission.
In short, patriotism is fervent in South Korea while in our case, it’s the bare minimum and only expressed on social media. Kamote pa rin tayo.",Politics
Amb. Babe Romualdez: Liar or just plain ignorant?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/amb-babe-romualdez-liar-or-just-plain-ignorant/,"What if the United States and China decide to fight each other in an unrestricted warfare? Which side  should the Philippines choose? The wisest answer is “None”, just like what are neighbors like Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia are doing. Better stay neutral and let these giants fight. If one emerged victorious, then choose the victor. Plain and simple.
Why does ambassador Romualdez want Filipinos to pay and die for America’s wars?
Philippine Ambassador to the United States of America Babe Romualdez recently wrote an article in Philippine Star telling the Filipinos how privileged his life is in the US, while failing to mention anything about the plight of our poor OFWs, and at the same time justifying President Marcos Jr. was right in choosing a side between two military superpowers about to lock horns instead of staying neutral.
Remember dear readers, Amb. Romualdez is the same guy who wants the Philippines to accept 50,000 Afghans who worked in the US military in Afghanistan during America’s illegal occupation of the country for over 20 years, but continues to fail to protect Filipinos who are persecuted and even killed in the US. Whose interest is he really serving?
The only problem is that, he  confuses facts with fiction. He either failed to do the necessary research or lying to the Filipino people  and  expecting Filipinos not to validate his statements from reliable sources.
Romualdez repeatedly boasts that the United States is way ahead in military might and technology against any nation.
So we checked the internet to validate and easily found that many statements of Romualdez are based on information either many years outdated or completely inaccurate.
US military continues to depend on China’s supplies and technologies
China’s integration into the global supply chains, including in sectors critical to U.S. military platforms, has  become indispensable and, even US organizations concede, are more advanced and affordable than any other products in the market. This entanglement raises concerns about the resilience and security of U.S. defense supply chains.
In fact according to a report by Govini, a US military analytics company led by a former US State Department official that received a $400 million contract for the report to study the procurement process of the US military, the US military continues to buys many of her arsenals’ integral components from China, even amid US-led sanctions, including parts to power the US Airforce prized fighter planes, the F-35s.
The US data analytics company goes on to say that it found that the broader US government, including DoD, has 922 Tier-one Chinese artificial intelligence suppliers and 552 Tier 2 AI suppliers. The AI category spans a variety of sub-segments including data integration, autonomy, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing.
Another Forbes article “China Was a Key DoD Supplier A Decade Ago – It Still Is”  reported that as early as 2012, over a million parts in the US State Department supply chain came from China and in 2023, these even including key components and software, “(US) military contractors of 12 critical technologies – from biotech to nuclear modernization and hypersonics – still rely heavily on prohibited Chinese suppliers.”
US invests on wars vs China invests on human development
The U.S. military exhibits an overreliance on research and development without sufficient transition to production-ready technologies, especially in AI. This makes their technologies very expensive and hinders the timely deployment of critical technologies in national security applications.
Amb. Romualdez also failed to mention that the drone companies he touted, like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, have  profited billions from the deaths of millions of people.
China actively promotes the application of AI technology in everyday  life with the goal towards helping uplift the welfare of the people across various sectors, such as healthcare, education, smart cities, and autonomous driving, in addition to military applications.
China has also surpassed the U.S. in AI patents and applications. China holds more patents across 13 critical technology areas as of 2022. This positions China favorably in the AI race, potentially impacting future economic and military dynamics.
China’s tech giants, such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, ByteDance, and a host of smaller startups have made significant investments and strategic deployments in the AI sector. These companies are capable of rapidly commercializing AI applications.
China has the largest internet user base in the world, with more than one billion users. This provides abundant data resources for training AI models. AI, especially machine learning and deep learning,  heavily relies on large-scale data to optimize models.
From the US-funded Govini’s 2023 report alone, Amb. Babe Romualdez is guilty of lying and misleading the Filipino people. Based on  global realities, the Philippines taking side with America against China is endangering its national security.
There was also a report called “Cratering Effects: Chinese Missile Threats to U.S. Air Bases in the Indo-Pacific,” published in December 2024 by the Stimson Center  based in Washington D.C., where Ambassador Romualdez is supposed to be working. The Stimson analysis highlights the vulnerability of U.S. air bases in the Indo-Pacific region to potential Chinese missile attacks.
The report states, in the event of a conflict, Chinese missile strikes could incapacitate runways and taxiways at U.S. forward air bases in Japan, Guam, and other Pacific locations, rendering them inoperable for fighter operations for approximately 12 days and disrupting aerial refueling operations for over a month. The report emphasizes that current U.S. countermeasures may be insufficient to mitigate these threats, underscoring the need for enhanced base defenses and infrastructure improvements.
Another fake news from Ambassador Romualdez
Despite all these, Romualdez concluded by saying: “Evidently, the decision of President Marcos to continue strengthening our relationship with the United States is not only correct – but also puts us on the right side of history.” This is in direct contrast to reality, as many of our neighbors are strengthening and increasing cooperation with China, supported for instance in the latest State of Southeast Asia 2024 survey released by Singapore’s top think tank, the majority of respondents from our neighboring countries said they would favour China, up more than 11 percentage points compared with last year.",Politics
Sara Duterte IMPEACHED! Her father saw it coming back in 2019…,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/sara-duterte-impeached-her-father-saw-it-coming-back-in-2019/,"Then President Rodrigo Duterte’s warning way back in 2019 has now become reality with the impeachment of his daughter, current Vice President Inday Sara Duterte.
Duterte on Monday warned Sara that the presidency will destroy her amid rumors she is positioning herself as his potential successor in 2022. He slammed “paid hacks” and “hyenas” in the media, some of whom have come up with critical reports of his wealth and policies including the war on drugs.
Because of Inday’s intransigence, they’re now in the middle of the battle of their political lives. As the presidency is a matter of destiny, the same can also be said about one’s family. The late former President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. (FEM) betrayed the former president’s father Vicente Duterte in 1967. Duterte, as such, never trusted current President Bongbong Marcos (BBM). It was really the latter’s sister, Senator Imee Marcos-Manotoc was was the conduit during the 2016 campaign.
Duterte paid his political debt with FEM’s burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. He never appointed BBM to a government post, he didn’t interfere in the electoral protest against Leni Robredo over the course of her vice presidency during his term as president and he also told his political allies to stop trying to impeach her because political stability was more important to him than being vengeful towards a political enemy.
The Yellowidiots, the Reds and the loyalists are all gloating now that Inday has been impeached. Inday was used as the stepping stone to the presidency and now she’s the doormat for the Marcos presidency.
We can now only wait for what the fates has in store for the protagonists.
But more importantly, we must realize by now who the real enemies are. If there is to be any hope for the country, these enemies should be put down and every effort should be exerted that they atay dead and be unable to make any political comeback.

Sara Duterte holds steady as crooked impeachment circus looms,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/sara-duterte-holds-steady-as-crooked-impeachment-circus-looms/,"Vice President Sara Duterte’s calm demeanor yesterday was indicative that they had anticipated this impeachment move and accepted it as a foregone conclusion. The lingering question is the timing given the complaint was transmitted to the Senate by the House of Representatives on its last session day.
Perhaps it was because House Speaker Martin Romualdez expected to force the hand of the Senate on acting on it before the session ended or maybe it was an agreement which was not honored by the Senate President. Regardless, everything is left hanging until June 2, when the Senate resumes its session or if President Bongbong Marcos (BBM) or the Senate president calls for a special session to tackle the impeachment complaint.
A Marcos loyalist who’s not in favor of impeachment, Yen Makabenta makes all the right arguments against the impeachment of Inday in his Manila Times article “House will fall flat on its face with impeach Sara plot”. He isn’t blind to the Pandora’s box that the impeachment has unleashed against the administration.
If Speaker Martin Romualdez is truly the mastermind behind the House caper, it is doubtful whether he will be mistaken now as presidential material ripe for election. If anything, this affair probably has made it unlikely or impossible for him to be elected as the new speaker of the 20th Congress in July. Martin’s ambition, sad to say, is an obsession that cannot speak its name. He cannot publicly say that he plans to run for president in 2028.
The advantage is on the side of Inday because they have a number of options in the interim. For the most part, it looks like she and former President Rodrigo Duterte (PRRD) have decided to milk the impeachment for all its worth. It will become the central issue of the campaign and will put candidates in the awkward position of having to disclose what their stand is.
It will also make the public think of their plight; inflation and the inability of the administration to bring prices of basic commodities down. There is an increase in utilities as well. The legislated wage hike won’t be taken up until June again and it’s not certain it will be passed before the end of the 19th Congress. There is opposition from employers who aren’t keen on being forced to pay for an increase that will hit small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMSEs) hard.
The bottomline is even before the impeachment, the administration didn’t have the momentum going into the midterm election and they have only added to the problems they face. The biggest is the citizenry can’t feel the benefits of the supposed economic growth that is being touted by the economic managers.
There is also the bad taste in the mouth left by the legislators with their ostentatious lifestyles financed by public funds. There is also the highway robbery that is the 2025 budget to add to this.
The past three years have confirmed that the leadership of the country is composed of an inner circle of three. It is evident in the way things are done and the inconsistencies which are too many for the public not to come to that conclusion.
It’s up to the public to judge the administration at the polls in May. Should the Duterte candidates be elected this makes Marcos a lameduck going into 2028 and political alliances will shift again. The Dutertes will not accept turncoats, but if they will, you can be sure there will be a reckoning where all those who did them wrong will be made to account and pay. This makes it imperative for the administration and their allies to stay in power.
How all of this will end no one knows. For as long as there is no leader who has the political will to undertake genuine reform, the Philippines will never get out of the rut it is in.
It’s ironic that after just three years in power, it feels to me that we’re back in 1985 all over again.",Politics
Sui Generis: Impeachment as more a political judgement exercise,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/sui-generis-impeachment-as-more-a-political-judgement-exercise/,"Impeachment in the Philippines is unlike any ordinary court proceeding. It is a sui generis legal process defined by the 1987 Constitution, designed to hold high-ranking officials such as the President, Vice President, and Supreme Court Justices accountable for serious offenses—including betrayal of public trust, corruption, and violations of the Constitution. Although there are elements resembling a criminal trial—like charging, presenting evidence, and hearing testimonies—the impeachment process also bears a deeply political dimension, making it fundamentally distinct from conventional legal actions.
The impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte underscores this dual nature. In regular judicial proceedings, strict adherence to rules of evidence is paramount, and outcomes hinge primarily on legal merits. Impeachment, however, occupies an arena where political alliances, public perception, and power dynamics can heavily influence the final verdict. A majority in the House of Representatives must first endorse the impeachment complaint, and only then can the Senate conduct the actual trial. The entire process is steeped in negotiations and maneuvering, as legislators weigh both the legal foundations of the complaint and the potential electoral consequences of their decisions.
In the Philippines, such political maneuvering is often rooted in transactional politics. Politicians frequently forge alliances based on pragmatic considerations — such as securing committee chairmanships, budget allocations for local projects, and strategic endorsements — rather than purely ideological alignment. When an impeachment complaint enters the scene, these transactional relationships are put to the test. Lawmakers and party leaders may attempt to trade favors, promise future support, or withdraw alliances to advance or block the proceedings. As a result, backroom negotiations and shifting loyalties frequently shape the course of impeachment, sometimes overshadowing the substantive legal questions at hand.
This scenario becomes even more complex as the nation looks ahead to the 2025 midterm elections. Traditionally, midterms are seen as a referendum on the sitting administration’s performance. An impeachment trial against Vice President Duterte would undoubtedly become a central campaign issue, with contenders from various parties pressed to take a clear stance on the matter. The transactional nature of Philippine politics means that candidates might be torn; some will try to distance themselves from the controversy to avoid alienating moderate or opposition voters; others may publicly defend the Vice President to court support from her loyal base.
However, voters are increasingly vocal about accountability and transparency, which places candidates in a bind. A politician’s silence or ambiguity could be read as an attempt to sidestep scrutiny, while openly supporting or opposing the impeachment could either boost or damage their electoral prospects, depending on the prevailing public sentiment. Those who fail to clarify their position risk being labeled opportunistic or complicit, potentially eroding trust among constituents. Moreover, the media spotlight on the impeachment trial will amplify every statement made by candidates, intensifying the pressure to pick a side and articulate a principled position.
Ultimately, impeachment is sui generis because it is not merely about determining guilt or innocence — it is a political judgment call wrapped in legal procedure. For the 2025 midterm elections, the transactional nature of Philippine politics will shape how lawmakers and would-be senators position themselves. Whether or not Vice President Sara Duterte is impeached, the proceedings — and the alliances forged or broken along the way — will leave a lasting imprint on Philippine governance, possibly reshaping political alliances and voter loyalties for years to come.",Politics
Sara Duterte fills the gap in the old Yellowtard-Communist Axis’s campaign rhetoric,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/sara-duterte-fills-the-gap-in-the-old-yellowtard-communist-axiss-campaign-rhetoric/,"Not surprising. The campaign strategy of the Yellowtards for the coming elections 2025 and 2028 is, yet again, that all too familiar “Anyone but [insert demonised person here]!” Nowadays that blank to be filled in the template rhetoric is none other than current Vice President Sara Duterte as Yellowtard “thought leaders” would like everyone to echo.
You’d think that the powers-that-be within the Yellowtard-Communist Axis would have learnt their lessons by now after they grudgingly backed former Vice President Leni Robredo who, at the eleventh hour, “united” a motley coalition of Marcos/Duterte-hating partisans in the hope of preventing a win by then candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who were running for President and Vice President respectively.
History gave these characters a rude awakening following a humiliating landslide defeat by the latter pair. Then as now, the Axis of Wokedom offered no vision to Filipino voters beyond a lame attempt to emotionally-blackmail them into voting for the “decent” choice. Talk about insulting the intelligence of an entire people!
Amidst the din of today’s lynch mob, it is evident that there is no national issue at stake other than to exact revenge on the Duterte clan. What higher purpose do the Yellowtards and their communist henchmen serve in Philippine society?
An ability to answer that question coherently is what makes or breaks political careers.
In what shape do the Philippines’ woke parties envision the country will take in 2028 and henceforth? It seems all they would have to say to that is that they “envision” a Philippines not led by a Duterte.

Incoming PCOO Head Trixie Cruz Angeles is Showing She’s Way Above Her Pay Grade and Other Emerging Appointment Booboos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/incoming-pcoo-head-trixie-cruz-angeles-is-showing-shes-way-above-her-pay-grade-and-other-emerging-appointment-booboos/,"On the matter of getting appointed to a cabinet position or government agency under the incoming second Marcos administration, it does well to behave with the humility and restraint of my best friend’s Aunty, Dr. Clarita Carlos.
Yes, that one.
When I came across an excel sheet that had the name of a government agency in one column and next to it was her name, I congratulated her.
She responded, “Paul, (it’s) just a list… hahaha!”
(I could probably write another blog on the significance of ellipses-followed-by-hahaha in everyday exchanges on instant messaging apps, but I’ll leave that digression for another time.)
If she had been mayabang or arrogant as some had depicted her to be, my guess is she would have hinted one way or another that she was up for a different position.
She’s sharp and feisty, sure. And this could sometimes be interpreted by the usual timid and meek looking Pinoy as mapagmataas. Sure!
But, I don’t think I have ever seen her count her chicks in public before they hatched in the way some other BBM appointees have — which to me, is pagmamayabang.
In fact, I’ve known her to almost always only say way much less than what she knows and this is the reason why I was pleasantly surprised when word spread that a certain Dr. Carlos was appointment as our incoming National Security Adviser.
I haven’t read much else said about her appointment or any word about how she is organizing the National Security Council Secretariat. I tend to believe that, owing to the nature of the office as well as Dr. Clarita’s character, little else will be said.
Because, after all, between the announcement and the rigors of getting the final green light from the Committee on Appointments is still quite a stretch.
Not a time to be seen doling out positions and favors.
In sharp contrast, the appointment of Trixie Cruz Angeles as the head of the Presidential Communications Operations Office caused quite a bit of a stir even before it was officially announced.
Before it was announced, friends in BBM’s camp were mentioning Angeles along with Ambassador Bobi Tiglao. Not a few figured that Tiglao would head the PCOO while Angeles would become one of the Presidential spokespersons.
As much as I find Tiglao’s tirades sometimes way out there and at other times too harsh, I’ve grown quite used to it and believe that what comes across in various media is fairly authentic. He’s a mean and cranky old man just like a couple of my friends and myself — that’s probably why I like him.
(I would have preferred Ambassador Babe Romualdez for the position but I’ve heard he’s up to replace Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin.)
If Tiglao had been appointed as the PCOO Secretary, it would have definitely struck fear in the hearts of BBM’s committed detractors.
Angeles on the other hand… hahaha!
Well, a disclaimer might be appropriate at this point. I met her and “worked” with her at a friend’s boutique PR firm way back in 2009. My friend said she was helping his PR firm with legal work as a consultant and also brought in some crisis management clients.
Back then, my impression was that apart from her work as an attorney for some people, she also contracted the services of PR firms and freelance publicists/journalists.
I even sat at a meeting where matters were discussed about an ongoing somewhat legal dispute between a shopping mall and local government unit. In the flow of discussions, there was an impression that Angeles was guiding both sides of the dispute in the way that US arms manufacturers aid fledgling democratic governments and freedom fighters.
An old blog post by a former colleague at RPN9 seems to describe the situation better than I can from my own recollection. In this post, the writer seems to have re-posted an account of Angeles’ dealings by Argee Guevarra — a former business partner of Angeles:
Sometime in May 2009, we accepted Gotesco mall owners’ request for us to render politico-legal services to prevent Caloocan City Mayor Recom Echiverri from gaining control and possession of the disputed mall. On the eve of the well-publicized takeover, she informed me that she will meet with some representatives of Recom. This supposed meeting was arranged by Amiel Cabanlig (a gay, bayaran blogger who always attacks PNoy in www.donavictorina.com and whose claim to social importance is bragging about his being a ka-chongkee and ka-cocaine of Mike Defensor).
I asked her why she needs to meet representatives of Recom and she informed me that Recom’s group wants to “pay us off” so that we abandon our clients. I allowed her to meet with the representatives but only to listen and spy as to their intentions and tactics. I gave her strict orders not to accept or make any deal that would compromise our existing attorney-client relationship with Gotesco Mall owners.
A week later, we were able to accomplish our tasks for which we received partial payment for our attorney’s fees.
Weeks after the Gotesco mall incident and considering my unwillingness to follow-up on the full payment of our attorney’s fees from the notoriously stingy and shrewd Gotesco mall owners, I just assigned the task to Trixie.
At around that time, she introduced to me her supposed estranged “husband” Atty. “Estanislao” Bong Angeles, a Utopia fraternity brod of Recom who approached me and who came up with a story about some Commission on Audit finding that he said could coerce or compel the Gotesco mall owners into paying us our remaining balance.
Since I don’t understand much about audit procedures, I just referred Trixie to my contacts in Gotesco mall and even accompanied her once to a meeting where nothing was actually accomplished because Trixie was herself vague of her husband’s idea or did not understand the importance of this supposed COA finding.

She has probably evolved much more since then.
Somehow, she must have cozied up with the Pnoy Administration and became Vice Chairman of the National Committee on Monuments and Sites.
Perhaps as a sign of her fealty to the Yellow Lord born by Yellow Saint Cory, she even tweeted back in February 25, 2013 that “True justice is when we see at least Imelda Marcos in jail.”
The Tweet received a number of comments and the most striking one was from a certain Bettina Monfort who said, “The son did not have anything to do with what his father did but might be punished for it.”
To which she retorted, “Not true that he did not have anything to do with the father. He uses ill gotten wealth. That is complicity after the fact.”
Since then, she became not only a social media influencer, but also a talk radio personality as well as a columnist — if I am not mistaken. Her successful foray in media might have been somewhat necessitated by her three year suspension by the Supreme Court in 2016.
There was even a point where she was or seemed to be the adviser for Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson and I am not sure that worked out well, if at all. If memory serves me correctly, this was the time when Asec. Uson got embroiled in a number of controversies which I would rather not enumerate because it seems to have flowed from one into another.
Aaaaand now she’s the PCOO Secretary designate.
If at all, her appointment is a sign that BBM is remaining true and committed to his campaign slogan of UNITY and it should be welcomed… nay! APPLAUDED!
I mean, why not? Was it not said by Abraham Lincoln or whoever that “I destroy by enemies by making them my friends.”
Angeles’ team mates, I overheard, confoundingly credit BBM’s largesse rather than Angeles’ prowess as a lawyer and communicator.
With a budget reportedly amounting to P1.9 billion, giving the PCOO to Angeles is INDEED an act of Marcosian largesse approaching almost legendary proportions.
That’s really far from the days when she was supposedly ousted by her law classmates when photocopying money supposedly in her care disappeared. Oh well, I don’t think the PCOO needs to outsource its photocopying requirements… or does it? We shall see.
Imagine, instead of having her shot in the face, having all her silicone parts wrenched from her body, or water tortured in the Pasig River for calling for BBM and his mother’s imprisonment, he does the complete opposite and gives her a plum position.
Which makes Angeles’ teammates envy understandable because they’re the ones I overheard talking about how she already earned the ire of one of BBM’s biggest political and financial supporters.
The story goes that Angeles received a call from the fuming Bigtime BBM supporter and I imagined her disintegrating under the hail of curse words coming from the other end of the line.
Anyway, according to Angeles’ team mate the caller was supposed to have said, “Trixie, I heard that you are appointing someone in PTFOMS. Is it true? Akin yan! Hindi PCOO yan.”
PTFOMS or the Presidential Task Force on Media Security was organized to help journalists who are under threats of harm or intimidation arising from reporting on illegal activities.
Angeles was said to have mumbled some sort of explanation but the Bigtime BBM Supporter just shouted back, “NO. That’s just what I want you to know.”
Thing is, according to Trixie’s teammate, she was not at all aware of how the PCOO is organized and how it works alongside other government agencies with functions ancillary to the Presidential communications.
As far as I understand, PTFOMS is under the Office of the President and works alongside PCOO. It is an essential component of a larger media policy implementation program designed to promote press freedom. In my mind, the Duterte media policy program includes the Freedom of Information Project Management Office.
Angeles’ teammate further explains that what caused her to go out of bounds in “handing out positions” was that her media cronies were bugging her none stop.
Thing is, and this is a crucial point, Angeles doesn’t yet have any power to hand out or even promise any position to anyone.
That’s not only counting chicks before they’re hatched, it’s selling a tray of eggs as lechon manok and apparently, someone bought the whole lot!
As it turns out, a group that wants to place one of its lackeys as the head of PTFOMS has been attacking the agency’s performance and propping up the profile of one Edu Punay as a replacement for the current PTFOMS head.
Edu Punay is reporter for the Philippine Star and Angeles’ teammate says he feels entitled to head the PTFOMS because he had printed one or two stories favorable to BBM.
A screenshot sent to me shows one of Punay’s friends congratulating him prematurely for being designated as PTFOMS head. It would not be unimaginable that Angeles or Punay may have spread the word of the designation way too early.
This did not sit well with the REAL transition committee, the one actually in charge of vetting the appointments for various positions in the BBM cabinet.
The actual words were, “Hindi pala nila alam yung ginagawang encroachment ni Trixie sa powers ng Office of the President. Bakit daw pinapangakuan ng position and nagpaplaning mag reorganize when hindi niya sakop yun and wala siyang power to appoint.”
In not so many words, pointed remarks were made about Punay’s eager beaver attitude towards getting a post.
Angeles teammate reveals, “Punay’s team resorted to all kinds of dirty tricks to blighten the record of PTFOMS. Even coming out with an editorial in a tabloid kung saan connected si Punay. Obvious na galaw niya.”
It was also said that Punay disparaged and belittled the current head of the PTFOMS, saying “wala siya sa kalingkingan ko.”
That’s the thing with some journos working for big media outfits, they inadvertently identify as the media outfit as if they had built it from the ground up. Colleagues of his from way back say that Punay wouldn’t have a had a headline story or a noteworthy byline if it hadn’t been enterprised by other reporters FIRST or leaked to him by very friendly sources.
Apart from Punay’s media campaign for the PTFOMS appointment, Angeles’ teammate also reveals that Punay pressured the reported PCOO Secretary designate by resigning from his media outfit. (Then again, I guess Punay might have been pressured as well by his media outfit to resign or get fired for moonlighting as a PR freelancer. It is unethical to work as a publicist while employed as a journalist.)
Word coming from another source is that Trixie may be on their way out even before they she officially steps in as PCOO Secretary.

Acting DPWH Sec. Oging Mercado Booted Ahead of BBM’s June 30 Inauguration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/acting-dpwh-sec-oging-mercado-booted-ahead-of-bbms-june-30-inauguration/,"Department Secretaries “leaving” before the end of the term of the President that appointed them usually isn’t newsworthy or even noteworthy. However, in the case of acting DPWH Secretary Oging Mercado, it seems he was booted out of office right after the wash of controversies that started plaguing his appointment almost from day one.
No one would have known that Mercado was given the old heave-ho back to the boonies of Leyte long before the assumption of DPWH Secretary designate Manny Bonoan had not someone from deep within DPWH misrouted a memo from Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea appointing DPWH Senior Undersecretary Rafael C. Yabut as Officer In Charge on June 23.
Word is that Mercado’s shenanigans and controversial dealings angered President Rodrigo Duterte, causing the old man to order his swift and immediate expulsion as acting DPWH secretary.
This is a whole seven days ahead of Secretary designate Bonoan’s first day in office, when he would be able to have full access to all of his department’s records — especially those pertaining to the transactions entered into by Acting Secretary Mercado.
Seven days is plenty of time for Mercado to hide or dispose of all the documents, which, according to sources, if put under proper scrutiny should compel a lengthy investigation not only by the Secretary designate but perhaps also the oversight committees in both houses of congress.
According to several published news reports and opinion articles Mercado was able to accrue all authority to approve projects, budgets and bid awards. The articles sources say that for 7 to 21 percent of the project cost, Mercado could guarantee that the project would be awarded to anyone who could bring him the money.
Word is that Mercado had counted on his Romualdez connections to assure that he would get designated or appointed by the Marcos Junior administration as the DPWH Secretary.
There might have been some manner of bounty sharing offered in exchange for staying as DPWH Secretary but as it turns out, this was unnecessary. As it turns out, the people he was counting on were merely humoring him and they had known that Mercador was on his way out.
Some sources close to the Marcoses were heard to have said that they found Mercado’s style repulsive and that this ran counter to what the incoming administration wanted to demonstrate within its first 100 days.
The last thing President elect Bongbong Marcos wanted was to have corruption allegations exploding before he could even sit in his dad’s former office.
In a sense, acting Secretary Oging Mercado’s face got slapped left and right or in local parlance, “nabigyan ng mag-asawang sampal sa mukha”.",Politics
Latest Laylo report shows Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte votes DWARFING all the rest,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/latest-laylo-report-shows-bongbong-marcos-and-sara-duterte-votes-dwarfing-all-the-rest/,"Latest Laylo Report on voter preference surveys conducted the 14th through the 21st February have been released and the numbers are staggering. Administration bets Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte maintain their formidable leads over their rival Opposition candidates with 63 and 54 percent of respondents indicating them respectively as their preferred candidates.
If the survey sample is an accurate enough representation of voter sentiment over the entire nation, Marcos and Duterte stand to win the majority vote if the elections were held today. It also means that Bongbong Marcos will likely go on to be the first president elected by a majority vote since 1986.
One wonders what the Opposition candidates have been doing since the 15th December last year when leaked slides from Laylo survey results showing Marcos attracting a 58 percent preference rate went viral over social media forcing Yellowtard thought leader Manuel L Quezon III to publicly reflect in his Inquirer column on the dismal state of the Yellowtard campaign even then.
[Leni Robredo’s] first campaign salvo was beyond a flop. Her latest commercial is better: a friendly but firm, enumeration of her policies for labor. A perfect ad: for a senatorial candidate, since most campaign on only or at most only a few, issues to set them apart. But it is not a presidential commercial. The overarching heart and soul of her candidacy in the public mind still does not exist because it hasn’t been communicated.
Laylo Reports are regarded even by the Yellowtards as sound and reliable indicators of public sentiment owing to their relatively larger survey samples. Quezon himself points out, “Pedro Laylo Jr.’s surveys have long been considered credible, a useful counterpart to the two bluechip survey firms, Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Pulse Asia.”",Politics
More Misconceptions borne from a narrow Anti-Marcos Mindset,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/more-misconceptions-anti-marcos/,"I’ll continue debunking myths that I believe are held under the Anti-Marcos mindset. Such myths led Anti-Marcos people to use a black-and-white approach, that the way to keep Bongbong Marcos from being elected is choosing the perceived polar opposite and desperately pushing this figure’s numbers up to the point of using the George Bush “if you are not for us you are against us” approach. “If you are not for Leni, you are on the wrong side of history,” is so elitist that you could probably inflate millions of dirigibles with this hot air. But anyway, on with my explanation.
1. If the Marcoses will be put away, all corruption in the Philippines will end.
I have written on this before, but this needs reiteration. Based on the assumption that the Marcoses are the sole cause of corruption and that corruption never existed before them, all that is needed is to erase the Marcoses and no Filipino will be corrupt anymore. I’m sure some other Anti-Marcoses find this foolish, but I’m also sure such people who believe these old-school superstitious mindsets still exist.
Obviously, corruption has been present even in times the Marcoses were not in power, such as during the American era, post-World War2/before Marcos and, of course, after Marcos. Indeed, post-Marcos corruption led some who went to the 1986 Edsa Revolution to reconsider their view of history, sometimes deeming Edsa a mistake.
I still hold that corruption comes from the grassroots, the most basic levels of Philippine society. Just look at ordinary people: they pilfer things and even kill each other in jealous fits over love interests without any politicians’ influence. If ever ordinary people get into positions of power, they bring their habits from the local situation or their local culture with them. The saying goes, “all politics is local.” Thus, corruption is local, too. Even if Marcos never came to power, another like him can still appear.
There is also the idea that putting the Marcoses away means justice will be served and he will be made an example to others. OK, then. But I doubt that even corrupt people will be scared upon seeing it. This is because it is possible that the example will never apply to them. They can even be part of the efforts to put the Marcoses away. Play the angel at first, then reveal your being the devil when you’re in power. Corrupt people are not always on the same boat; they can be enemies of each other too.
2. If Bongbong Marcos returns to power, martial law will be declared and killings will be ordered.
Well, it is possible but… does he really want to do that? Saying BBM will do it just because his father did is a ridiculous and illogical connection. He knows that it is a dumb thing to do. The people believing this seem to imply that they have mind-reading powers and know what BBM can be thinking. Also, just remember that Congress’ approval is needed for martial law to be declared.
People fear that certain candidates will bring around authoritarianism. What makes you think the others, even those who seem “clean” and “angelic,” will not? Again, it is folly to believe that certain people have a monopoly of the “bad elements” in society.
3. If we get all the money the Marcoses stole, the Philippine will become rich and be out of poverty.
This is the mentality that poverty can be cured by giving lump sums to the poor. No, redistribution never solves poverty. As the case of lottery winners proves, people are great at wasting money and can get even poorer than before they won. Also, even if the money was all recovered, there is no guarantee that it won’t be squandered and lost again (well, some of it was).
Money won’t buy everything we need. All that we need in life has to be reproduced by repeated work. Farmers and livestock raisers have to work continuously to produce that food we eat every day, and we have to work almost every day to buy that food. Filipinos though likely wish to be free of work and have food fly to their mouths. Which will never happen.
Also, BBM said in his earlier interview with Jessica Soho that, though he admits the Marcoses have accounts in Switzerland and such, the numbers were inflated in reports against them and they are not from the Philippines’ coffers. This is what Marcos apologists like Rita Gadi also say. Of course, I do hope to know with finality the truth about this. If the apologists’ side is confirmed, then there’s even less hand-outs to expect.
Money can be lost not only to corruption, but also to incompetence. Even if you remove corruption, honest mistakes and bad decisions even by well-meaning people can still lead to losses. This is why I nowadays strongly oppose strong centralized control wherein you assign people to produce materials without using market dynamics. That is what caused millions to die of starvation in Mao-era China.
4. Trolls are responsible for the resurgence of Marcos popularity.
The Marcos legend had been built over a long time, through stories, opinions and anecdotes passed on through word-of-mouth, offline. The old people will always look at the old days as being better and will associate it with the leader at the time.
Internet trolls likely had little effect on the growth of the Marcos legend. Such efforts depend anyway on what has already been built offline and only serve to affirm what people have already been believing for a long time. Those who are “converts” are likely few.
Even then (1980s) the tall tales were circulating, like that of BBM having actually died and being replaced by a lookalike (probably inspired by Jesus Quevenco, pictured). Saying that tall tales originated only from Internet trolls is wrong. What the picture below depicts has always been the most trusted news source for Filipinos, one that worked even without online communication.
This is why any “door-to-door conversion” attempts will not work.
——————————————
“Converts” to Marcos from the Yellow side were brought about by, as I described above, reconsidering who was on the good and evil sides. Basically, it turned out to be in the reverse for them. They think the Yellows deceived Filipinos and the Marcoses are innocent. Tell them that both sides can be seen as corrupt at the same time, they say no, it can only be black and white. But who parroted “black and white only?” The Yellows. Their messaging (which you can call propaganda) was turned around on them.
I do not go for Marcos myself, the reasons I’m sure everyone knows. But if I were really vehemently anti-Marcos, I would be concerned about the attention being given to Marcos, because it is drawing more people on his side. I would tell them, stop giving him negative publicity as it is still publicity and it is helping him. But, I’m sure the Marcos side would say, don’t interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
I was told that big business backs the Pink side. If true, that is even more reason not to choose that side as I believe they would like to enact policies that inhibit social mobility for poorer Filipinos. Actually, it boggles me, as I believe some of Robredo’s supporters spoke out against big business’ influence in the country before, but now they embrace the opposition candidate when she’s supported by big business.
I also do not subscribe to the logic of getting the next most popular candidate to be a buffer against Marcos. I would rather vote according to the candidate closest to my principles. Robredo fanatics still embrace populist methods. They’re using the same methods as their opponent, thereby using the same thinking that caused the problem.
Then I hear that I will be on the wrong side of history if I don’t vote for her. Even if I vote Abella, Gonzales or Lacson? So be it then. I’m on the wrong side of history for some, but to me, I exercised my freedom and voted for who I want. Not because some misguided consensus dictated on me.",Politics
The “holy” Opposition say they are battling an “evil” thief. Filipinos don’t give a shit.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/the-holy-opposition-are-competing-against-an-evil-thief-and-filipinos-are-ok-with-that/,"T-minus 2.5 months. The Philippine Opposition have abandoned all pretense of a positive campaign and are all-hands-on-deck mounting a demolition campaign against their common “enemy” of this brief moment, administration presidential and vice presidential candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte. It is an interesting exercise considering the Opposition bring to bear methods and information they have been using since the late 1970s — allegations that the Marcoses are thieves, that they are murderers, that they are liars, and that they oversaw an “unprecedented” decline in the Philippines’ economic fortunes. Considering the age and bluntness of the “weapons” of demolition they wield in this homestretch, it continues to baffle most sensible observers how Opposition purveyors of these methods are able to expect their political fortunes to change for the better.
The major Opposition bloc, now effectively composed of Leni Robredo’s Yellowtards, Nery Colmenares’s communists, Big Corporate Media, and the Roman Catholic Church (the latter two effectively the Philippines’ biggest and wealthiest political parties), have for so long been drumming up the “Evil Marcos” narrative. But have they drummed that story in successfully? In actual fact, they have.
Every single Filipino is aware of all that the Opposition have been screeching about with regard to that Evil Marcos narrative. Indeed the public consciousness is saturated by it. Members of Marcos’s formidable base of committed supporters are very likely even more familiarised with this Evil Marcos narrative than the Yellowtards and commies themselves. You wonder then who the Yellowtards and commies are preaching to? What new information are they delivering? They have been investing so much of their meagre brains and precious time to this exercise — to the extent of neglecting building any sort of intelligent platform — that it leads us to wonder if they have, at any point, stepped back and taken stock of any returns on that dubious investment.
The Opposition to date offer nothing transformative or visionary to Filipinos. Several “presidential forum” media circuses organised in rapid succession over the just the last two to three weeks have so far achieved nothing other than to exhibit the vacuous nature of the collective Opposition pitch to the Filipino people. Tired old pandering to “the poor” are all we get from the Opposition nuisances. What do they propose is the path to building a strong and great nation? We don’t know yet. But, hey, they still have two months and a half to tell us.
More importantly, the way the Opposition are desperately posturing over the remaining days of the campaign have only proved one thing — without Marcos in the picture they essentially have nothing much to work with. This is made readily-evident just by a quick peruse of the social media timelines of just about every Yellowtard and commie Netizen — from their most lowly troll to their chi-chiest Katipunan-educated “thought leaders”. Marcos this and Marcos that. Small wonder that these bozos routinely all go tililing whenever Marcos declines an invitation from their most revered “journalists”. A media circus is not a media circus unless a Marcos graces the occasion. Bongbong Marcos does not have to campaign any further. The Yellowtards are doing that work for him.
If the Yellowtards and commies insist on continuing their negative campaign, they should at least apply a bit more originality and imagination to their effort. At least tell Filipinos something they don’t know. Perhaps it is about time the Opposition consider what they had long convinced themselves to be unthinkable — that Filipino voters are making truly informed choices on who to support in the coming elections and that they should regard these choices respectfully for a change. For now, if they truly believe they are the “good guys” in this “fight” they tell us we are in the midst of, well, that narrative is proving that it has come down to them competing with an “evil thief” of their own fashioning and are losing.",Politics
Team Bongbong Marcos – Sara Duterte wows MASSIVE Philippine Arena crowd in show anchored by ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/team-bongbong-marcos-sara-duterte-wows-massive-philippine-arena-crowd-in-show-anchored-by-abs-cbn-star-toni-gonzaga/,"Yesterday’s campaign kick-offs again made the writing on the wall even more evident with the clear topping of the shows of the day by administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who “rocked” a packed Philippine Arena. Even communist “journalist” Inday Espina Varona was moved to admit, “[in] terms of numbers, the son of Ferdinand Marcos and the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte won the campaign kickoff mobilisation game,  no ifs nor buts.”
In terms of production quality, scale of organisation, and overall pizzaz, the performance delivered by Team BBM-Duterte outclassed all the rest. As many in the audience observed, ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga was in her element as host of the event. Her booming voice could have filled the arena even without a mike.
To that, Rapplerette Lian Buan sourly points out, “Toni Gonzaga, one of ABS-CBN’s biggest celebrities, introduces Rodante Marcoleta who pushed to deny the franchise renewal of the network costing thousands of Kapamilya workers their jobs.” Buan, still likely butthurt from that “assault on press freedom”, seems to suggest that Gonzaga owes utang na loob (a debt of gratitude) to ABS-CBN. That’s just typical of kiddie “journalists” glossing over the real facts underlying the demise of the top Yellowtard media conglomerate just to push their preferred narrative.
Of course, a lame attempt to cut down the the host of the show is futile considering not just the star power that was on exhibit in the event but also the chemistry between the candidates. This was evident in the service vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte did herself in the clear and articulate speech she delivered to introduce herself and the grace she exhibited giving her running mate a rousing introduction.
Speaking of stars, third-generation Marcos star Sandro Marcos seemed to be making his dad proud demonstrating an ability to steal the show from the latter as the crowd roared when the big background screen briefly cut to him as he flashed the victory sign.
Indeed, it was a wild night — the culmination of steady consistent work over the last eight to twelve months to secure the numbers, form the best relationships and alliances, manage communications and messaging, and, overall, deliver an engaging and sticky brand to Filipino voters. Of course, this was a journey very-well documented by the more objective contributors to the national debate that the Opposition’s chi chi Katipunan-educated “thought leaders” like to pretend do not exist. As such, to really appreciate the remarkable nature of what was achieved by the administration camp would be to note what a respected member of the Opposition camp has to say himself (albeit a tad grudgingly) about even just the latter two to three months of that journey and what, by now, should be an outcome that no longer surprises…
Marcos’ refusal to slide down and Inday Sara eventually sliding down to number two coated him with a veneer of toughness and finally lent him the air of being a winner; it also gave both him and her (Marcos Jr. and Inday Sara, respectively) something they’d lacked thus far: the sense of being backed by a significant […] durable coalition featuring former president and speaker Arroyo (plus the Romualdezes). It was this drama, and the coalescing of the veteran politicians, that boosted Marcos’ presidential numbers, and made Sara the person to beat for the presidency. It sucked all the air out of the room, politically speaking, stalling the moderate momentum of Leni Robredo who’d kept the remnants of the opposition guessing, and absolutely depriving the other candidates, Moreno, Pacquiao, and Lacson, of what their candidacies needed, too: drama. The keep ’em guessing plus substitution gambit of 2016 succeeded in its 2021 rerun.
The point Inquirer columnist and former Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III was leading to in making the above observation taken from his piece today “Now for the hard part” really had more to do with what he regards as the hard slog the Opposition is in for over the remaining weeks of their campaign.
This early, his campaign can claim the tantalizing possibility of the first majority presidency since (take your pick) either 1986 or 1969. But there remains hope of the others, currently in the teens or less, percentage-wise, to somehow convince the public to join them and thus start giving the Marcoses a run for their money.
Quezon’s statement of “hope” for the Opposition clearly doubles as a warning. It is a warning because the Opposition, specially the “leading” Yellowtard bloc within it rallying around presidential candidate Leni Robredo show no signs of reforming the negative messaging that characterises their campaign and which contributed to the running to the ground of their campaign. Even more important for the Opposition is that they reconsider the sorts of characters they habitually associate themselves with.
In the case of the Yellowtards’ chummy-chummy relations with the Philippines’ Catholic Church the officers of which are held to a vow of obedience to their overlords in Rome, displays like these — of nuns in ancient habits performing ancient rituals — raise questions around how serious Robredo’s camp are about upholding their supposedly progressive character. The standout example, in this instance, is their supposed championing of women’s issues and their supposed alignment with the “causes” of feminism and gay rights. The Roman Catholic Church, we might remind everyone, stands for everything that feminists and the gay community are against.
The big challenge in the coming weeks is mainly on the Opposition nuisance candidates. Will they continue competing amongst themselves for the Number Two position? Or will they be able to pull together the mettle, the creative chops, and the groundbreaking originality required to gun for Number One?

“How the hell do you reverse a perception of being dumb in just three months?”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/how-the-hell-do-you-reverse-a-perception-of-being-dumb-in-just-three-months/,"In his Manila Times column today, former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao handily sums up the challenge the Opposition need to step up to in order to “whittle away” (in the words of The Noted One) the enormous lead of administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos. How to make the dumb Yellowtard presidential candidate appear smart? That is the million-dollar question.
It’s time Robredo pull the biggest feat of transformation of her career. She has, after all, gone through many wardrobe changes over the last several years and the time has come for the fat lady to sing (pardon the pun).
To be fair, erasing the Dumb from her personal brand will be a monumental challenge, specially over such tight time frames. This is, after all, a perception that was many years in the making. There is no need to go into the detail to grasp the vast foundation of dumbness upon which the Robredo brand had been propped. Fundamental to all this is Robredo’s inability to string together a statement in straight English. This trait alone is the single biggest indicator of just how dismal her cognitive faculties are.
It gets worse. Robredo is surrounded by stupid people. This is evident in the incoherence and downright kabaduyan (campiness) of her campaign. To begin with, Robredo was dumb enough to allow a motley group of supporters to cobble together a “grassroots” campaign for her. One wonders if it was plain laziness to fail to step up to the role of Chief Architect of one’s own campaign or just a bad case of a total lack of vision or, at least some imagination, to apply to the craft of strategic planning. Whatever it is that was behind this massive failure of leadership, it is clear that Robredo oversaw an astounding amateurish desperate trial-and-error campaign management fiasco. That, folks, was dumb.
How then can DUMB be fixed in three months? Even if the Yellowtards had an infinite bucket of money to throw at this challenge, it is hard to imagine how such an untenable problem could be solved. No, it is not just untenable, it is an intractable problem. Perhaps if we translate that latter word to Tagalog, Robredo and her Yellowtard followers will be better able to grasp just what a big problem this is: hindi magkandaugaga. Plain and simple, there’s just no solution that adds up to solving the problem of just how stuck the dumb perception is to the Robredo political brand.
What then? How does one proceed from here? That’s a difficult question — probably a good one the next presidentiables interviewer should add to her list of questions to ask Robredo. There are a couple of guiding principles for a good interviewer — one who has the balls to ask those questions — to keep in mind when listening to Robredo explain what she plans to do in the remaining three months of the campaign:
(1) Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
(2) You cannot solve a problem using the same thinking that created it.
Does it take a “Peabody Award” or a Nobel “Peace Prize” to ask the right questions when interviewing politicians on a desperate campaign trail? Absolutely not.",Politics
COMELEC party to Yellowtard anti-Marcos campaign thanks to Commissioner Rowena Guanzon and spokesman James Jimenez,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/comelec-party-to-yellowtard-anti-marcos-campaign-thanks-to-commissioner-rowena-guanzon-and-spokesman-james-jimenez/,"One would think that a hearing conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and presided over by one of its top officials, Commissioner Rowena Guanzon, would be above partisan politics. The COMELEC, after all, is an election governance body and the Filipino public accords it their trust under the premise that it maintains an objectivite distance from partisanship. Thus it is a baffling sight to behold seeing this noble agency reduced to being a party to the vilification campaign being sustained by the Opposition led by its dominant Yellowtard bloc against leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos.
One wonders why today’s proceedings to review disqualification petitions against Marcos’s candidacy were held up by his absence. Guanzon herself, in a tweet, led everyone to believe that Marcos’s presence at the hearing was an absolute requirement.
This was echoed by COMELEC spokesman James Jimenez as well in a tweet issued at about the same time.
Note, however that a Manila Bulletin report published on the 4th January quotes Jimenez stating that Marcos and the petitioners “are not required to attend. This is usually attended by counsel only”.
Guanzon also notably references a tweet issued by a member or supporter of one of the petitioner groups. The tweet exhibits images of partisan paraphernalia that expresses support for the disqualification of Marcos from these elections. That Guanzon would show this sort of partiality to one party in this hearing is inappropriate considering she is the presiding official in this exercise.
Thanks to the unbecoming actions of Guanzon and Jimenez, the COMELEC has become the source of a lot of social media chatter surrounding what is essentially a non-issue. Rather than contribute clarity to the discourse, this agency is sowing confusion! It raises the possibility that this case, which does not actually hold any legal water, was more an exercise meant to put Marcos through the wringer before the cameras. It explains why his presence (which actually wasn’t required) was made out to be so important.
Guanzon, after all, is a known Yellowtard and many observers are adamant that she was privy to the real agenda of this proceeding — to lynch Marcos and use the outcome of that lynching to bolster the floundering campaign of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo. If true, this is nothing short of a dastardly and dishonest initiative to be a party to and Guanzon and Jimenez ought to be ashamed of themselves.",Politics
“We need to make Leni WIN!” and other chilling Yellowtard ululations,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/we-need-to-make-leni-win-and-other-chilling-yellowtard-ululations/,"The more the facts surrounding Opposition presidential candidate Leni Robredo’s failed campaign confront her followers, the more we hear this call to action: We need to make Leni win. Take a bit of time to pause and think about that for a minute. Is it up to Robredo’s “KakamPink” camp to make her win? It seems the Yellowtards are forgetting an important detail about democratic elections — that it is the people through their votes in elections that determine who gets to serve them in leadership roles. Campaign teams do not make politicians “win”. People make them win. And elections are not about politicians “winning”. They are about the people choosing.
Herein lies the whole trouble with the attitude the Yellowtards apply to their campaign. Reading between the lines when taking stock of the messaging they put out, it is easy to detect the sense of entitlement in their regard for these elections. If their dishonest “good” versus “evil” narrative in which they cast themselves as the “good” weren’t enough, they believe they hold the right to judge a person’s personal preferences. We see this in how, with every random encounter they have, they demand that people reveal to them who they plan to vote for and then, following that, slander the choice of that person.
A lot of Filipinos like @bethangsioco don't realise that it is IMPOLITE and downright IMPROPER to ask people who they are going to vote for. This is why ballots are secret. One's voting preferences are PRIVATE.https://t.co/lIG4Xcx30X pic.twitter.com/vQTnxDNULB

It’s no wonder that Robredo’s campaign is not making any headway. Members of her camp insult the Filipino Voter’s intelligence at every turn. Rather than offer them clear bases to make a smart choice, the Yellowtards routinely subject them to emotional appeal or, worse, emotional blackmail. In his recent Inquirer opinion piece “Lost opportunities”, Manuel L. Quezon III writes of the incompetence of Robredo’s campaign strategists specially in those crucial early days observing how “her ads were weirdly angled to please perhaps those who made them and approved them, but not the voters. In a similar manner there was a ridiculous motherhood-oriented pitch that threatened to sink her campaign before it could even be launched”. Quezon was not through with them yet at that point in his piece which he caps with this categorical indictment…
Her first campaign salvo was beyond a flop. Her latest commercial is better: a friendly but firm, enumeration of her policies for labor. A perfect ad: for a senatorial candidate, since most campaign on only or at most only a few, issues to set them apart. But it is not a presidential commercial. The overarching heart and soul of her candidacy in the public mind still does not exist because it hasn’t been communicated.
And so now, as they sink further into the depths of desperation, Robredo’s supporters’ call to action remains as nebulous as her campaign platform itself. But there is a chilling ring to it. We need to make Leni win. How exactly? With magic? Oh, wait…",Politics
Massive Yellowtard damage control campaign underway following Leni Robredo’s statement condoning vote buying,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/massive-yellowtard-damage-control-campaign-underway-following-leni-robredos-statement-condoning-vote-buying/,"By putting up Leni Robredo as a poster girl of virtue, humility, and a champion of service to “the poor”, the Yellowtards have built themselves into a fragile house of cards. The fragility of this political brand came to light this week following Robredo’s latest public gaffe where she assured her audience in a forum for kasambahays (household servants) that selling their votes is OK.
As expected, Yellowtardom quickly shifted to damage control bringing to bear the mass communication might of their allies in Big Corporate Media who were quick to issue “clarification” around what Robredo said and frame it within the “proper context”. Robredo’s statement was quite categorical, however. So clear was her message that a generic tweet issued by Commission on Elections (COMELEC) spokesman James Jimenez copped a deluge of defensive responses from Robredo’s mob.
I disagree with the notion of taking the money and voting according to your conscience. Vote buying is an election offense regardless of financial situation or noble intentions. Di dapat ginagawa, at di dapat sina-suggest yan sa mga botante.
— James Jimenez (@jabjimenez) October 26, 2021
Yellowtard lawyer and “thought leader” Gideon Pena voiced a similar sentiment in a tweet fielded even earlier than Jimenez’s.
Unfortunately, so intense was the Yellowtard defense campaign that even he was forced to delete said tweet and issue a subsequent backpedal.
It was a privileged take. Thanks for educating me on the issue.

For his part, Jimenez stuck to his guns even in the face of attacks against him coming from Yellowtard Netizens and even the media — like the true man of conviction that he is.

Leni Robredo digs her own political grave every time she opens her mouth,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/leni-robredo-digs-her-own-political-grave-every-time-she-opens-her-mouth/,"Why is the Philippine media so obsessed with current Vice President Leonor “Leni” Robredo? No other Vice President in the history of the Philippines attracted as much press coverage as she has over her term. She gets even more airtime than President Rodrigo Duterte does, which is ridiculous. Every Vice President ever voted into office usually stays in the shadows and only gets thrust into the limelight when the President is not available to attend a function or is incapacitated. This has not been the case at all with Robredo. In fact, Duterte was hardly ever unavailable during his six-year term, but the way the media has been interviewing Robredo and getting her two-cent opinion on every issue whether big or small, you would be forgiven for thinking that she has a bigger role to play than just being a spare tire. Such is the media’s bias for Robredo.
It’s an open secret that members of mainstream media in the Philippines are allied with the Opposition. They have played the role of kingmaker for decades since the late former President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986. Media personalities do not even hide their choice of candidate for the 2022 Presidential Elections with journalists wearing pink as a show of support for Robredo.  She switched to pink in an effort to distance herself from yellow – the colour of Liberal Party, which is the party that has become synonymous with the losing team. Prior to that, however, journalists from big networks did not feel shy about showing their preference for yellow as well.
The irony is, despite Robredo being the Darling of the Media, she still gets consistently low ratings in popularity surveys conducted in the lead up to the coming elections. The recent report on the survey conducted by Pulse Asia shows that she only got 20%, which is way behind former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr’s 53%.  She only received 14% in Metro Manila too. That’s baffling considering she had a lot of exposure to residents from the National Capital Region.
One wonders what happened to those who supposedly voted for Robredo in the 2016 elections. If she really won as Vice President just like they say she did, where are those voters who made her win? It seems they are nowhere to be found! Perhaps there is truth to the allegation that she only won due to electoral fraud. One such allegation is there were ballots that were pre-shaded with Robredo’s name even before the election was held. We recall that during the vote recount conducted by the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Robredo’s camp requested the tribunal to apply just a 25% shading threshold to evaluate the validity of ballots being reviewed. Unfortunately, the tribunal sided with her. The reason they allowed it was due to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) breaking its own rule and ignoring the 50% shading threshold rule with vote counting machines. Indeed, this mockery of institutions can only happen in Third World countries like the Philippines. No wonder a lot of people still can’t accept Robredo’s win against Marcos as legitimate.
Let’s say for argument’s sake that Robredo actually won as Vice President. Why then is she lagging behind Marcos today? It is surprising to see her low ratings since she has the advantage of being in the second highest position in government and she has the backing of big media giants. Meanwhile, Marcos is still getting attacked from left, right and centre.
Indeed, history books and media commentary have not been favourable nor kind to the Marcos family. Even President Duterte tried to downplay Marcos’s abilities as the next President after Duterte decided to back his close friend and Senator Bong Go for President. But this has not turned off Marcos supporters. Like what I have said in my previous articles, it was the failure of the Aquinos and their allies to institute reforms to help the country progress that put the Marcoses back in government and that could soon see them return to Malacanang. The people eventually realised that those who replaced Marcos Sr were not only more corrupt, they were also incompetent. Their only advantage was having the media behind them to help hide their indiscretions. But of course they could not hide Cory and Noynoy’s incompetence forever. In fact, much as they tried to appear competent, tragedies during their terms exposed the truth — that they were not after the welfare of the people. That gave the people enough reason to give Marcos a second look. Their supporters now believe they were wronged and were robbed of their place in history. Now the people want to help “correct” the history books. But I digress…
So why is Robredo unpopular with the voters despite her unfair advantage? Because she doesn’t act like a real diplomat and exhibits very little statesmanship. She acts more like a puppet. She doesn’t know how to play by the rules. As the current Vice President, she didn’t realise she should stay in the sidelines and allow Duterte to shine. She, instead, wanted to be in the limelight herself and this she did by criticising Duterte incessantly. That was her biggest mistake. One doesn’t criticise a popular President unless one is prepared to lose supporters. She wasn’t smart enough to charm Duterte and earn his support.
Robredo just didn’t know when to shut up. She’s made so many stupid statements about issues and gaffes on record that became fodder for countless memes. Her campaign is all over the place because she keeps changing her strategy. One moment she is catering to the C-D crowd, the next she is on the cover of a posh magazine. The people can see through the façade and see the hypocrisy in her campaign. The people know she is not the brightest bulb in the room. They even gave her the nickname “Madumb” which has stuck like a rash to her personal brand since. The more Robredo talks, the deeper the hole she is digging for herself.
It is clear and becomes clearer by the day. Robredo may have “won” the Vice Presidency in 2016, but the majority of voters clearly do not want her to be the next President in 2022.",Politics
Yellowtards hyperventilating as they speculate on Sara Duterte’s next move,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/yellowtards-hyperventilating-as-they-speculate-on-sara-dutertes-next-move/,"As expected, the Yellowtards are having a cow over news that Inday Sara Duterte has withdrawn her candidacy for Mayor of Davao City raising fears that she is taking steps to join the national race. Evidently they had latched on to some sort of notion of a “promise” made by Ms Duterte that she will not be running for president — bizarre considering that they have long convinced themselves that the Dutertes are a bunch of “evil” liars. Why, after all, would you hold on to a perceived “promise” coming from a person you had summarily written off as a liar?
The Yellowtard clearly are desperate. Why are they so obsessed with their rival camp’s wheeling and dealing and clever maneuvers? One would think that the self-appointed “good guys” in this contest would be more focused on minding their own business and just getting on with it. Isn’t there enough work to do building political capital and running your campaign? Oh wait… the Yellowtards do not have a campaign. Indeed, if they did have one, they’d be too busy using it to convert people to their “cause” instead of nitpicking on every move of their rivals.
What will happen will happen either way. This is the last week before the substitution deadline on the 15th of November. Anything Ms Duterte does will likely be perfectly legal under current election rules. The Yellowtards really need to channel their energies towards one imperative: getting better at campaigning. Of course there is also that small matter of Opposition votes spread hopelessly thin across four major presidential hopefuls. What got the Opposition to this point at such a desperate hour despite months — even years — of celebrating one another’s shared hatred for the Dutertes and pathological fears of a return of the Marcoses to national power?
Unfortunately for the Opposition, there are no suckers like the Doy Laurels or Mar Roxases of yore these days who would be willing to tuck their nuts in and gracefully bow down before the eminence of a leader deemed winnable by all-knowing Yellowtard elders. The closest to an Anointed One would have been Leni Robredo. Unfortunately, Antonio Carpio who attempted to anoint her is not seen to be a Yellowtard elder. For that matter, Robredo had never been winnable to begin with, specially in considering that even her “win” in 2016 itself remains debatable to this day.
The Yellowtards are now faced with a difficult question. What’s next? That’s a hard questions to answer for a bunch of people proven incapable of thinking farther ahead than the next week. If they had actually been able to think far ahead enough, they wouldn’t be hung up about rivals playing substitution games. They’d, instead, be busy winning an election. Evidently, that too is just too hard for the typical Yellowtard “thought leader” to wrap her pointed head around.",Politics
So This Is What A Smart Fight Is For “Pinklawans”!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/so-this-is-what-a-smart-fight-is-for-pinklawans/,"“Pinklawan” presidential bet, Leni Robredo, recently appealed to her adherents to carry their fight in a smart way by effectively challenging disinformation. The problem is, instead of following the marching orders of their candidate, these people seem to be the ones going on overdrive in disseminating disinformation. It makes you wonder if her followers are truly the “decent” and “intelligent” segment of society that they profess themselves to be. Let us look at some of the recent disinformation drive being peddled by the Philippine society’s crème de la crème.
One Leni supporter posted a photo of a supposed public message from Oxford University denying Bongbong Marcos (BBM) of earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Studies. Perhaps the idea of this post by this Leni supporter is to put BBM in a bad light by suggesting that BBM never completed a Bachelor degree program at Oxford with a suggestion that BBM is an Oxford University dropout. The problem is, this issue has long been addressed and resolved already. BBM clarified this in 2015 when he was still a senator of the Republic. To bring this up again smacks of malice from this Leni supporter. He seems to conveniently ignore the already-known fact (widely since 2015) that BBM was conferred a “Special Diploma” for Social Studies by Oxford University.
Now, there is no question that a Special Diploma is not the same as a Bachelors degree and this was made clear by Oxford through a document from the university describing the nature of the diploma granted to BBM. But what is funny is the perpetuation of innuendo that BBM is an Oxford dropout even suggesting that he may have just attended the university for a year and may have been expelled after failing the first year exams. A Rappler article in 2015 shows that:
Our sources, who commenced at the same college as Marcos Jr in 1975, say that he stayed for only a year. One of them wrote in an e-mail: “It is my understanding that he was sent down (expelled)…Having failed his Prelims (first year exams), Ferdinand Jr never completed his Bachelor degree at Oxford. It is possible that he might have received a face-saving diploma, which is not the degree that he claims.”
It is amazing how Rappler, the paragon of truth and integrity, seems to willfully inject an unsubstantiated projection from an anonymous source, just to advance an anti-BBM agenda. What is unfortunate is, anti-Marcos social media justice warriors take such innuendo hook line and sinkers without much careful thought and consideration.
A quick look at the degree confirmation document issued by Oxford University clearly belies the smear being thrown at BBM. The former senator did attend Oxford University from October 1975 and satisfactorily finished the Special Diploma program on July 1, 1978. So it is clear that BBM did attend Oxford University for almost 3 years, not merely 2 semesters (or within a span of 1 year) as some Leni supporters seem to be spreading. It is quite a marvel how the mind of a Leni supporter works!
Going back to BBM’s Special Diploma, the idea that it is merely a “face-saving diploma” is quite amusing given the fact that it was good enough to be used for admission to the MBA program at the prestigious Wharton School of Business. Rappler even confirmed this in their article, even sharing the statement from their source:
Marcos Jr entered the MBA program in 1979 and attended until the fall of 1980. However, he withdrew sometime during this period or early spring in 1981 and never graduated. They do not know why. However, Wharton confirmed that Marcos Jr went there but never graduated.”
So if BBM’s Special Diploma is merely a “face-saving diploma” for Oxford University dropouts, an idea that Rappler seems to be perpetuating, why was it good enough for a prestigious business school’s MBA program? Afterall, the Wharton School of Business website does say that the minimum requirements for admission to the MBA program are as follows:
Ah yes… Leni supporters seem to have ignored the part that says “.. or equivalent in another country”. Maybe it was assessed that BBM’s special diploma was equivalent to a Bachelor degree obtained in the United States? Whatever the case may be, what is amazing about these “decent” and “intelligent” Leni supporters is how they seem to be so oblivious about the difference between the word “same” vs “equivalent”. A quick linguistical check would show us that:
As adjectives the difference between equivalent and same is that equivalent is similar or identical in value, meaning or effect…”
But making an effort to see the difference may be a little too much to ask of the “inteligencia” so maybe it would be easier for them to understand it this way:
Thing is, BBM did acknowledge that he did not finish the MBA program at Wharton as he went back to the Philippines to serve as Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte. Why anti-Marcos minions are still belaboring the point that he did not graduate at Wharton is beyond me.
Of course Rappler seems to be outdoing itself in terms of disinformation at a drop of a hat! In the past week alone, the disinformation drive against BBM has been on overdrive. There is the infamous online survey that Rappler issued that backfired on them big time. They were probably hoping to have their regular readers (who are mostly of the Yellow persuasion) vote for Leni thus giving them an ammo to use to push for the idea that Leni’s popularity is on the rise and perhaps even better than all the current crop of presidential candidates! Unfortunately, even in their own survey and even with Rappler’s alleged manipulation of votes, the BBM votes annihilated the Leni votes forcing Rappler to take down the survey. Netizens lambasted Rappler for its apparent “attempt to deceive the public into believing that independent presidential aspirant Leni Robredo is now getting the support of netizens”.
Another seemingly disinformation effort from Rappler that was recently exposed was their claim that a motorcade of around 4,000 – 5,000 vehicles rolled throughout Legazpi City in Bicol in support of Leni’s candidacy. This claim has been put into question because no drone shots showing the magnitude of the caravan has been made available and that the whole claim seems mathematically too incredible. RJ Nieto (aka ThinkingPinoy) offers an illuminating take on his Facebook page.
Of course the biggest disinformation that Rappler has peddled lately has been their claim that the Bangui Windfarm project was not BBM’s. My previous article also touched on this malicious attempt by Rappler to discredit BBM. Moreover, Rappler was hit right, front, and center by different people even by people who were actually involved in the development of the project! DWIZ 882 Karambola host Jonathan de la Cruz noted:
Renewables and energy development have always been one of BBM’s advocacies.The initiative to precisely harness the province’s renewable resources was originally stated and affirmed in the Provincial Development Plan which was completed with assistance from various national and international agencies during BBM’s first term as governor from mid 1982-February 1986. Had the family not gone into exile in 1986, this project like the now aging Tomato Processing Plant (Northern Foods Corporation), the country’s only tomato processing plant, which was set up during his first term would have been completed much earlier. I should know. I am a native of Bangui and I was BBM’s Special Assistant and provincial administrator during his first term and served as adviser during his second term when the windmill project was undertaken.”
It is quite puzzling why in order to promote Leni, Rappler would need to engage in a nasty and malicious disinformation drive to discredit Leni’s rival – BBM. Even with the deck so stacked against BBM in the mainstream media, Rappler seems to believe that Leni is not capable of sealing the deal on her own merits and that she needs the help of the jaundiced mainstream media to artificially prop her up by smearing BBM. If Leni is indeed the most qualified candidate for president as the “inteligencia” assert, then why does it seem like she is getting dumped by the majority of the Filipino people like an aging first wife for a younger supermodel? Maybe it is because Leni is just not well liked for coming out as a fake, insincere, weak and inept leader (if one can really call her one). Perhaps it is because of her inadequately thin resume for the role of chief executive? Afterall, her chief executive experience (be it local, regional, or even business) seems thinner than Lovi Poe’s septum. Or maybe that she is a part of an institution that the Filipino people distrust and are just too sick and tired of? Whatever the case may be, Leni supporters seem to be getting desperate in trying to make their candidate look competent using Poisoning the Well tactics.",Politics
POS Wants BBM To Eat (Pink) Cake,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/pos-wants-bbm-to-eat-pink-cake/,"Now hear this, folks! Whether we like it or not the world of the Pinklawans in Philippine society has become the arbiter of truth, intelligence, class, decency, and morality. Very much like the Hollywood celebrities in America, the Pinklawans expect the rest of us “peons” to embrace their dictates and beliefs because otherwise, in the words of the Hollywood royalty Paris Hilton, you’re just not “hot” (yes, she is that profound). In our country’s case, what is hotter than the elite Oxford Philippines Society or what I prefer to call the Pinoy Oxford Society (POS)? The very same group that recently made a declaration that essentially looked down on BBM’s credential as his credential is not the same as theirs.
Some of the prominent POS characters claiming to not be playing politics.
So this group, POS, a group of 200 Oxford University students and former students, with Filipino roots, declared (with such authority) that:
i) Bongbong Marcos matriculated at the University of Oxford in 1975 to read for a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (the “Degree”). Matriculation is a formal ceremony marking a student’s admission to the University of Oxford. This is a requirement that all students need to undergo at the beginning of the course.
ii) Bongbong Marcos did not finish his Degree. This was officially confirmed by Oxford University in 2015.
iii) Bongbong Marcos failed his Degree’s preliminary examinations at the first attempt. Passing the preliminary examinations is a pre-requisite for continuing one’s studies and completing a degree at Oxford University. Preliminary examinations are taken in the first half of a degree course, usually in a student’s first year of studies.
iv) Bongbong Marcos has been awarded with a Special Diploma in Social Studies in 1978. A Special Diploma is not a degree, and neither is it comparable, superior nor equivalent to one. A Special Diploma is not a course of higher education leading to an undergraduate or first degree or even a master’s degree.
Funny, but as they have averred to, this issue has already been confirmed in 2015! Why they are bringing this up again despite the fact that this has been clarified already is quite mind-boggling. But they say they are not doing this for political purposes. Oh no! Surely not! We’ll simply just have to believe them as much as we have to teach our daughters to always believe their boyfriends whenever they say: “Trust me baby, I’ll pull out in time”.
Now if the purpose is merely to dispel “disinformation” and to inform the public that Bongbong Marcos’ “Special Diploma” is not a degree nor something that can be used to lead up to a more advanced credential, then why is there a need to even mention that BBM failed his first attempt at the school’s preliminary exams? Should we then demand the Integrated Bar of the Philippines to make a statement that Leni Robredo is a Bar flunker? That she needed to retake the Bar exam to be a lawyer? I find it hilarious to see a bunch of snotty little-nosed rich twerps and their older contemporaries make assessments of the value of another person’s credential, the hell with the registrar’s office!
But the POS gods have spoken, and Filipinos are expected to bow down to the majesty of such authority. I wonder out of the 200 members of this elite group, how many of them belong to the top 100 notable Alumni of the University of Oxford? Last time I checked the list, only two Filipinos made the top 100. The first one being BBM who is ranked at #66 and the other one being Isko Moreno at #86. How can someone who doesn’t have the same piece of paper as these POS boys and girls have and how can a former lowly squatter from the streets of Manila be recognized in the top 100 notable Oxford Alumni and not one of them who are part of the crème de la crème of Philippine society? To top this off, how can a “Special Diploma” be good enough for acceptance to the MBA program at the prestigious Wharton School of Business if they declared that BBM’s Special Diploma is not a course of higher education leading to an undergraduate or first degree or even a master’s degree,  as they declared? Aren’t they supposed to be the final arbiter and authority of what a Special Diploma is worth? Oh, this must hurt the fragile little egos of the snotty little Marie Antoinettes! Awww… how about a slice of a nice sweet pink cake?
The Marie Antoinettan hubris of these elites makes it so much easy to mock. I would recommend my readers to mock one if ever you get an opportunity to do so for their stupid and pretentious opinions. Don’t let an opportunity pass by because you can bet your second- and third-class ass that they will not hesitate to do the same to you. These folks assume that their wealth and prestige are substitutes for intelligence, competitiveness, and wisdom, when in all likelihood it is often nepotism that gets them to where they are. (Okay, I take that recommendation back. But you do get my drift, right?)
Now what is worse than the elites? Well, that would be the peons who think they are elites just because they agree with and identify with the sentiments and persuasion of the elites! Acting so uppity and intellectual, these Einsteins don’t seem to realize that very much like their degrees from the University of the Philippines or the Ateneo or De La Salle, their degrees (and experience) may not mean jack squat at other institutions, organizations, or even countries! To embrace the words of the elites doesn’t make one an elite. Just because you agree with people perceived to be intelligent does not make you intelligent! To believe so is idiotic. It’s kind of like watching television in the middle of the night and coming across a commercial showing a cool looking guy wearing a nice Ralph Lauren shirt hanging out with other cool looking guys and cute chicks, all happy and giddy. Now, if you think that if you buy that Ralph Lauren shirt you would end up being like that cool looking guy hanging out with a bunch of other cool guys and cute girls, then congratulations! You are an idiot! You will still be the same old chump only $90 lighter!
Anyhoo, it really is up to individual institutions or groups to assess whether a degree is equivalent or not precisely because equivalency is, as an adjective, about having similar features or identical value, meaning or effect. In other words, it is a value judgment. To make a sweeping statement that a Special Diploma isn’t is the height of hubris! Anti-Marcosian uppity idiots seem so gleeful at this latest slight at BBM’s educational background, they seem to fail to realize that the degrees and diplomas they have from their respective universities may not mean anything either to others, perhaps even to the POS folks they seem to be glorifying now! Being so fixated on watering down another person’s educational background, perhaps, is the “decent” thing to do for these sanctimonious bunch.

Hope for a “united” Opposition collapses amid bickering between commies and Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/hope-for-a-united-opposition-collapses-amid-bickering-between-commies-and-yellowtards/,"“We’re being told to let Leni lead. It’s time to make sure Liberals and its allies do it first.” Thus goes Kat Stuart-Santiago’s call to action in her blog post “Leni and the Liberals”. “There is no reason to believe in claims of unity and democracy when it doesn’t include the activists on whose lives we depend on so we might not risk ours,” Stuart-Santiago pompously points out after her on-point observation…
Because the anti-Left sentiment of the Liberals—including its Akbayan and Magdalo allies, and even the Aquinos and the Roxases in its ranks—is common knowledge at this point. If anything it reveals how [Socialist presidential aspirant Leody de Guzman’s] assertion is correct: the ruling classes, whether it’s the Liberals or the Duterte-Marcoses are the same, because the anti-Left sentiment is the same, and when that exists, then the anti-worker, anti-peasant, anti-IP, anti-activist sentiment cannot be far behind.
Ano kasabihan sa Pilipino, hindi pa man din, nag-aaway na sila. The alliance between liberals and the leftist-militant groups seems to be skating on thin ice as the issue about progressive representation in Robredo’s Senatorial slate has been heated since the announcement last Friday. Gamitin natin ulit ang wikang Pilipino. Bukod naman dun sa mga “guest candidates” may tunay ba na kakayahan manalo ang mga tunay na kandidato ng Dilaw na naging Pink? To my mind, the guest candidates are in for a possible voter backlash if the senatorial candidates misjudged the sentiments of the public. Malay mo kung karamihan sa kanila ay mas iboboto ang mga kandidato ng PDP-Laban na iilan lang ang balik-Senado. Huwag na natin isama si Bino.
What’s happening between the liberals and the leftist-militants is an ideological bickering with no sensible direction. Why? How many times have leftist-militant candidates made a bid for the Senate and lost? It began in 2010 with Satur Ocampo and Liza Masa. You would think Satur had an even chance but his vote count proved otherwise. Masa fared worse. In 2016, the leftist-militants rode on the coat-tails of Grace Poe. Same result. 2019 was the same again. This the very definition of stupid – doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result each time.
I don’t see any reason why they are bickering but they are. Can you imagine what would happen if they actually win? Not to belabor the issue, Leni can’t even lead. So what’s the point? And frankly, with a platform that is “block Marcos and oust Duterte” (Stuart-Santiago’s own words) in the midst of a pandemic, would voters even think about voting for them when they don’t even bother to take cognizance of the looming worsening economic situation brought about by oil price increases and interest rate hikes? This is in addition to supply shortages.
The members of the Opposition all need collective bitch-slapping to knock some sense into them that it is not about their personal agendas but the people’s welfare that is paramount. This is why I can’t wait for the debates. I’d like to see how Robredo will fare against Senators Lacson and Bongbong Marcos. I’m sure Robredo will get her ass handed to her and that would be really fun to watch. I can hardly wait.",Politics
Manny Pacquiao a DISHONEST political tool to split the Duterte vote in Visayas and Mindanao,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/manny-pacquiao-a-dishonest-political-tool-to-split-the-duterte-vote-in-visayas-and-mindanao/,"Manny Pacquiao’s rise to boxing superstardom was unprecedented for a Filipino. His is the original narrative of what is literally a rags-to-riches story starting in the provincial hinterland and ending up in the big city looking for his future. Now, Pacquiao is up for the biggest match of his life after declaring he is running for President.
What does Manny bring to the Presidential dais? Unfortunately, NOTHING. Pacquiao’s starting premise is that he is qualified for the Presidency because he came from poverty and understands what Filipinos need from government in order to rise above poverty. No one has told him it’s not as simple as that. Getting elected into office isn’t easy. Pacquiao himself found this out when he first ran for Congressman in General Santos. Up against the powerful Antonino clan, Pac-Man lost. He had to transfer to the Sarangani congressional district to win.
He had no formal education so Pacquiao wasn’t equipped to step up to the challenge of legislation. He didn’t have an adviser who could show him how to go about being a Congressman. He was also busy with his boxing career and was more absent than present in the House of Representatives. He gained nothing from the experience. After only one term, he decided to make the jump to the Senate. He was elected into office again. This time, Manny vowed to spend more time as a Senator than a boxer. That didn’t happen again. Having become accustomed to a high-maintenance lifestyle, Pacquiao needed to build up his financial reserves. Since coming into money, there have been no reports of his being able to establish a successful business. His expenses include not only his immediate family, but also his extended family, both his and his wife’s side. It didn’t help that one of his acquisitions was the ultimate status symbol; a mansion in Forbes Park.
Pac-Man didn’t hide his political ambition. In 2016, he dumped Jojo Binay in favor of Rodrigo Duterte. He had been friends with the Davao Mayor when he was going up the boxing ladder. The same with the Pastor who was also in Duterte’s camp.  Pacquiao availed of the opportunity given by Binay’s University of Makati (UMak) to obtain a college degree. It was later discovered that it was in fact invalid because it wasn’t covered by a Commission on Higher Education (CHED) special order which is a requirement for students under an alternative learning program. Pacquiao didn’t attend college under normal circumstances. Bottomline, he probably didn’t even bother at all. UMak just gave him the degree in Political Science nonetheless.
The question in the public’s mind is what prompted Pacquiao to seek the Presidency? The answer lies with Koko Pimentel. PDP-Laban was a moribund political party until Jojo Binay decided to use it as his vehicle for higher office. It was under this party that he ran for the Vice-Presidency in an alliance with Joseph Estrada in 2010. The falling out between Binay and Pimentel began shortly thereafter when the younger Pimentel won his electoral protest against Juan Miguel Zubiri, forcing the latter to resign. Binay wanted to adopt Zubiri as a candidate, a proposal Pimentel refused. It was then that the demolition of Binay began in earnest at the Senate with Pimentel taking the lead and Sen. Alan Cayetano and Antonio Trillanes as the hatchet men.
Pimentel peré et fil struck gold with Rodrigo Duterte running for President. Duterte had been a member of PDP-Laban at its inception as an advocate of federalism for Mindanao, the brainchild of Pimentel Sr. and Reuben Canoy. Duterte’s victory made PDP-Laban the dominant political party and handed the Senate Presidency to Koko on a silver platter. The Pimentels had long been opposed to Marcos, the elder having made his mark as the renegade Mayor of Cagayan De Oro during martial law. The alliance with Duterte wasn’t a natural fit as Duterte was leaning more towards the Marcoses against his mother, Soling, who led the anti-Marcos protests in Davao City. Soling’s activism was the reason that Duterte was appointed Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Vice-Mayor of Davao after Ferdinand Marcos was ousted. Pimentel couldn’t be trusted with protecting Duterte in the Senate and it was for this reason that he was replaced by Majority Leader Tito Sotto.
Pacquiao’s candidacy is nothing more than a ploy to split the Duterte voter base in Visayas and Mindanao. This was why Pimentel unilaterally made Pacquiao acting Party President around August 2020 which caused the resignation of Secretary-General Pantaleon Alvarez. Duterte kept out of the fray until Pacquiao suddenly came out criticizing the administration. He formed his own team with Pimentel’s loyal aide, Ronwald Munsayac on loan to him as Chief of Staff. What is ironic now is 1Sambayan talking with Pacquiao after lead convenor Antonio Carpio writing him off as being unqualified for inclusion in 1Sambayan’s presidential selection process because of his absences in the House and Senate.
What is evident now is the Opposition is desperate. Robredo needs a running mate. The most likely scenario is Pac-Man slides down as Vice-President to divide the votes of the President if he pushes through with his VP candidacy. The Bisaya voting bloc knows better and it won’t be as successful as the Opposition leaders think. But it gives impetus to a Robredo presidential run which would be a return bout with Bongbong Marcos if the administration fields a Marcos-Duterte ticket should the President decide that Inday Sara “Daughterte” will not run for President.
Marcos Jr., is a very divisive candidate. He cannot win on his own which is why he needs the elder Duterte as his running mate. A Daughterte-Marcos ticket isn’t a political slamdunk. Daughterte is vulnerable in Luzon and the National Capital Region (NCR) when up against Sen. Ping Lacson and Isko Moreno. I would think the President sees this vulnerability as well which is why he decided to accept the PDP-Laban nomination. The endgame scenario for the administration is a Marcos-Duterte ticket with a Senate line-up of new faces to add to the Duterte incumbents in the upper chamber. Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) is running in her Pampanga district again which means that she will again contend to become Speaker of the House. It is only with this strategy that the constitutional amendments needed can be passed.
Duterte is not likely to leave the job undone. He would probably have a different outlook if the pandemic didn’t happen. With his approval rating at an all-time high despite the efforts of the Opposition to discredit him and his achievements in terms of infrastructure and social services he has tucked under his belt and his no-nonsense style of communication, Duterte is going into the political ring one last time to cement his legacy and ensure a brighter future for Filipinos.
National artist F. Sionil Jose has thought of him as deserving consideration as one of the greatest Presidents the country ever had, in his mind, I think the man is actually going to go for it. The opportunity is too great to pass up. Destiny is calling again and Duterte won’t pass up on it.",Politics
The only argument the Yellowtards and commies have against Bongbong Marcos is that he is a Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/the-only-argument-the-yellowtards-and-commies-have-against-bongbong-marcos-is-that-he-is-a-marcos/,"If there is anything that encapsulates just about all of what the Opposition has to argue against the recently-announced candidacy of former President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., it is the headline given to this Rappler piece authored by Lian Buan: “Dictator’s son Bongbong Marcos to run for president in 2022”. Being an avowed “social news network” in the service of the Yellowtards (the Opposition bloc of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) it is only fitting that Rappler‘s girlette frame her “report” around the only argument in the Opposition brains trust’s intellectual arsenal against the most winnable of this election cycle’s presidential bets.
Buan’s writing is fully in-character…
Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, will run for president in 2022 – in a move that aims to complete the family’s return to power 35 years after they were ousted by a civilian-backed military revolt and forced to flee the country.
Indeed, the whole of Yellowtardom owe their existence to this narrative of Filipinos having to be in a perpetual state of “vigilance” so as to ensure that the “horrors” of the “Marcos years” are to “never again” happen. Perhaps it is high time that these presumed “leaders” of the Opposition pause and reflect. If that whole premise remained as compelling as it once was 20 to 30 years ago, why do they now tremble at the prospect of “another Marcos” in Malacanang? Maybe it is possible that Filipinos have just had enough of all that shrill fear mongering.
The Yellowtards, it seems, would like to keep Filipinos imprisoned by this engineered fear forever. They regard Filipinos as idiots who need to be “protected” from their own curiosity lest they wander too far away from the bahay kubo. This they do by filling their minds with dishonest tales of the terrible tikbalangs and kapres that lurk in the forest.
In light of Bongbong Marcos now being in the race for the presidency, the Opposition need to confront the important question: Does “another Marcos” in Malacanang necessarily presuppose a return to authoritarianism? Consider too Marcos’s qualifications using sheer experience alone as the key metric. Buan herself points out; “Marcos has been in government for 28 years, starting in 1980 when he became vice governor of Ilocos Norte at age 23 and his father was president under Martial Law. He won as governor and representative of Ilocos Norte before serving as senator for one term from 2010 to 2016.” How do Buan’s preferred presidential candidates measure up to that? Indeed, the next most popular candidate could not even complete one gig as Mayor of his home city before setting his eyes on the top job. What’s up with that, right?
And then there is that election — the one that Yellowtardom’s Joan of Arc, Leni Robredo, supposedly barely “won” against Marcos. If Robredo had really been as popular as Marcos was in 2016, why does she consistently trail just about every one of her rivals in just about every reliable poll over the last several years? This, even as the same sample sets show Marcos consistently sustaining his numbers throughout. It’s one of those things that make you go “hmmm…”. As in, hmmmm… who really won the vice presidency in 2016? The mystery persists, specially so that then Commision on Elections (COMELEC) chairman at the time, Andy Bautista, remains holed up with his relatives in the United States refusing to face the music.
Remove the whole “Marcos is evil” ululation from the Yellowtard rhetoric and what does that leave them in a face off with Marcos in a debate? Big fat ZERO. It raises yet another important question: Shouldn’t Filipino voters expect more of their Opposition than the tired old “Marcos is evil” strawman that they’ve been hiding behind all these years? Certainly it is high time that more forward-looking minds be applied to the political “debate” — a debate the Yellowtards would like to blanket with the emotional blackmail they had been perpetrating against the Filipino people for no less than three decades.",Politics
Any investigation on gov’t “troll farms” should also include an inquiry into the dishonest practice of “journalism” by mainstream media,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/any-investigation-on-govt-troll-farms-should-also-include-an-inquiry-into-the-dishonest-practice-of-journalism-by-mainstream-media/,"Joel Ruiz Butuyan in his Inquirer piece “The defeat of the trolls” writes of “strong suspicion that the current government employs so-called troll farms.”
The ongoing Senate investigation has uncovered that the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) pays 1,479 “contract of service employees.” There’s a strong feeling that these are trolls hired by the government, so the Senate is absolutely on the right track by asking the PCOO to submit their addresses, educational attainment, daily time record, and job description.
Martin Andanar has never been the sharpest tool in the comms toolbox of the government. Five years and he hasn’t achieved much improvement in government communications. But the Senators should also haul mainstream media to the Senate for an investigation into violations of the basic tenets of journalism. Mainstream media is biased against the administration. It seldom happens that you’re able to read anything that leaves the reader to form an opinion. It’s made for the reader. Their reporters and anchors are the same. The environment is simulated to go back in time as if we’re under a dictatorship when in fact, we’re not.
Despite her best efforts, Maria Ressa has only been able to fool her Western colleagues about her fight for “freedom”. She hasn’t directly made a statement about the corporate structure of Rappler and why it is fortunate enough to receive grants from American non-government organisations (NGOs) that are known CIA fronts. No self-respecting journalist has bothered with an in-depth report on Rappler‘s finances; primarily how it has been able to continue operations while incurring losses. Its stockholders don’t seem to run out of cash to infuse in this “social news network”.
While they’re at it, the Senators should also invite Ellen Tordesillas of Vera Files, another recipient of grants from the same NGOs that Rappler has received monies from. By law they should register as foreign agents. No one knows if they’ve complied with this requirement. The Opposition will never admit it but they also operate troll farms. You just need to check the accounts on Twitter with limited followers that get retweeted hundreds if not thousands of times. Our Senators should also be aware of bots. Nowadays you can build bots using readily-available software. They’re designed to perform single or multiple functions. They were primarily deployed by the Opposition for mass reporting of pro-Administration Facebook accounts and pages. The pro-Opposition trolls also took down the Mocha Uson network. That was really a for profit operation using the pay-per-click model. All that showed that the number of likes or followers of a page does not necessarily convert into votes. The then PCOO Assistant Secretary failed to land a party-list seat in Congress.
The problem with the Opposition in the Senate is their hypocritical stand on issues. The ongoing circus with Pharmally is an example of how not to conduct an investigation in aid of legislation. Mainstream media just goes along because we now have “journalist-activists” in our midst. They are not objective but subjective. They campaign against the government on social media with their personal accounts. This bastardizes the system because the so-called fourth estate is supposed to be the moderator between government and the public. What they don’t realize is this can also backfire. The public takes sides on the same bases. Those who see through the deception gravitate towards the administration. Those whose biases are confirmed go for the opposition. The lack of an issues-based discussion leaves the public at a disadvantage because it opens them up to exploitation by unscrupulous politicians.
It is, however, obvious to the public who the enemies are. You have the liberal-leftist-militant cabal in politics and media which continue to spew propaganda. It is for this reason that they cannot win elections anymore. Butuyan would like to think that they have the advantage going into 2022 with majority of the voting population between 21-45. He writes…
There’s a whiff of the spirit of the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution in the air with the crescendo of dissent in all social media platforms. If the youth ride the tide of dissent that’s fast gaining strength in cyberspace, they may yet have their generation’s peaceful revolution come May 2022.
We have seen how voters interest in the election is high. They have gone out of their way and put up with the difficulties of registering to vote for the first time or activating their voter registrations even if they have to wait for long hours in line. No surprise because we’re at a crossroads again because of the pandemic. The opposition should at least have the decency to accept the people’s judgment if they lose on May 2022. We’ve seen how they can be sore losers since the time of former Presidents Joseph “Erap” Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and most recently with Duterte in 2016. Perhaps we should get it down in writing that if they lose, they will stop with their destabilization efforts and work towards nation-building with whoever who is elected.",Politics
Duterte’s unfinished business and the clear plan for 2022 to 2028 that the Opposition LACKS,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/dutertes-unfinished-business-and-the-clear-plan-for-2022-to-2028-that-the-opposition-lacks/,"One of the items on Rodrigo Duterte’s platform of government in 2016 was federalism. This has remained unfulfilled largely due to the Senate being the stumbling block to constitutional amendments. The 1987 Constitution doesn’t state explicitly of both houses of Congress voting as one or both, with a 3/4 majority is required to deem an amendment is passed and submitted to the people for ratification in a referendum. This may be one of the reasons why Duterte has opted to run for Vice-President in 2022. This is his unfinished business.
The PDP-Laban Senate slate is composed entirely of candidates that Duterte can expect to support his move to change the country’s system of government. It’s also a referendum on his performance as President. If he receives a new mandate as Vice-President, this confirms he has the people’s support to move forward with his unfinished business. Duterte would need at least 18 votes to pass an amendment abolishing the Senate and transitioning to a unicameral parliamentary system. Most of the candidates who have declared their bid for the Presidency haven’t disclosed their platforms yet. Not much can be expected from Isko Moreno and Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao. Isko is definitely the candidate of anti-Duterte oligarchs. He will not move to change the form of government. In the case of Pacquiao, the same is true because Koko Pimentel has his hand up Manny’s ass.
Moreno, Pacquiao and Robredo are best described as sock puppet candidates. The priority concern of Filipinos is moving forward in the present environment. Corruption cannot be minimized under the present bureaucracy. It will have to be a reset and the best way to do that is to devolve it. The same is true with digitization. It cannot be implemented wholesale specially with departments and agencies which are national in scope. The pandemic has exposed the country’s lopsided economic development where 40% of economic activity is in NCR+. As an archipelago, there is no limitation to regional development given airports and seaports have been improved nationwide. Infrastructure is much improved but the work is not done yet. This is why the priority is still infrastructure. It is the better investment than the social amelioration that the Yellows and Reds have been pushing for.
A welfare state breeds indolence and mediocrity. What better way for the oligarchs to control the people if not in this manner. This is why there is no basis in Isko’s and Pac-Man’s claims that they best know the needs of the poor just because they were poor once. Isko’s social amelioration programs in Manila only serves the interests of the powers that be at City Hall. It is not real economic development because there is no job creation. As far as Pac-Man is concerned, he has no experience whatsoever when it comes to policy formulation. You can’t expect Pimentel to teach Pac-Man or for the latter to understand what it will take to lift the poor out of poverty.
In the grand scheme of things, a Marcos-Duterte ticket, a Senate majority of 3/4 of the vote and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) as Speaker of the House is the ideal scenario for charter change moving forward. This is why next week will determine what the issues will be for the May election. This is why the country is at a crossroads and this is why we should vote on the basis of issues and not popularity or personalities.",Politics
"Dubious DigiVoice “survey” claims Isko Moreno “tied” with BBM and Daughterte, contradicts Pulse Asia report showing Inday Sara at top by large margin",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/dubious-digivoice-survey-claims-isko-moreno-tied-with-bbm-and-daughterte-contradicts-pulse-asia-report-showing-inday-sara-at-top-by-large-margin/,"Two surveys were released yesterday. Pulse Asia and DigiVoice. One had Sara Duterte as the leading choice for President while the other had Isko Moreno. Cognitive bias is real. This is your natural predisposition for the candidate of your choice which is devoid of logical basis. Each person applies their own unique cognitive bias to their observations. As such, you have diverse numbers as to who is likely to be elected President. Survey design is based on the science of statistics which defines the parameters of a survey design. For example, if your survey is done in the top ten provinces with the most number of registered voters, it would be skewed because the composition would have no provinces in the Visayas and Mindanao island groups. That’s not representative of the whole country. Then there’s the conduct of the survey itself. The reason why the sample size is between 1,000 – 1,500 individuals is cost. It has to be as random as possible. This involves sending out survey takers to the remote areas which is costly.
What’s ironic is the “Chief Political Analyst” of DigiVoice, Antonio Contreras, touts their survey as credible based on the methodology he describes, which has respondents downloading their mobile app and answering the proferred questions in the app. This means that the respondent would need to have a smartphone and internet connectivity, both of which limits the scope of the survey. In his Manila Times piece “Moreno, Marcos and Duterte-Carpio tied at the top – survey” today, Contreras asserts on the back of his firm’s sketchy methodology that “if elections were held today, Manila City Mayor Francisco ‘Isko Moreno’ Domagoso, former senator Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr. and Davao City Mayor Sara ‘Inday’ Duterte-Carpio are statistically tied for the first to third places. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.”
Before you take all that seriously, consider that Contreras is a Forestry graduate of the University of the Philippines’ Los Baños campus (UPLB). If he took up his master’s in Political Science or his PhD, that would make him inarticulate in terms of course alignment. Maybe this is why his political theories aren’t grounded in realities. He has never been part of any campaign for national office. He doesn’t have an established reputation as a political operator. He also doesn’t fit the bill of one in the modern setting.
Lito Banayo is older than Contreras but he definitely fits the bill of a political marketing professional. With the advent of social media, came everyone’s freedom to express their opinion whatever that may be, but one can’t claim to be an expert off the bat. Most opinions published on social media would fall under the vernacular description of “kuro-kuro” or “kuwentong barbero” in reference to what the “tambays” in the community discuss about current events at the neighborhood sari-sari store or the barber shop. Even if we give the Chief Political Analyst the benefit of the doubt with his startup, their survey is just another one in an already-crowded industry that counts Pulse Asia, SWS, Publicus and Octa among its key players. Anyone who is for the candidates leading in this survey would definitely have a positive view of it. That’s cognitive bias at work. Surveys are snapshots of a particular point in time.
The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) announced yesterday that it has already 63M registered voters which was their forecast by May 2022. It is only September. With the registration extended for another month, there will be more than what the COMELEC estimates, obviously. Filipinos are anxious to vote because there is a lot at stake in this election cycle. Those who strive to guide the voters about the qualifications and competencies of the candidates are doing them a service. But those who insist on false premises and theories are just peddling snake oil. This is why we should be more discerning as voters. We should strive to vote for the best candidate based on facts in the platform of the candidate and not the motherhood statements which appeal to emotion more often than not. The DigiVoice survey should be taken with a grain of salt. Isko is not unbeatable. Not by a longshot. When you have your campaign manager and chief of staff coming out with public statements alongside their client rather than keep to the background taking care of the details, that’s indicative that the campaign is running scared.",Politics
Examples of DISHONEST language used by the Opposition that divide rather than unite Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/examples-of-dishonest-language-used-by-the-opposition-that-divide-rather-than-unite-filipinos/,"The inability of the best minds of the Philippine Opposition to unite various partisan camps that would like to see the end of the Duterte dynasty’s reign over national politics will be the subject of debate among historians in the years to come. At present, the Opposition is hopelessly fragmented into feuding chieftains, each with their own personal agendas backed by business interests at stake. Presuming to hover above this morass of competing personalities is “vice president” Leni Robredo who continues to push the fantasy of a “United front” against the camp of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte.
The trouble with Robredo and her ilk is that they continue to use divisive language in their ironic efforts to “unify” their dishonest lot. Here are the key messaging no-no’s that these morons continue to do-do…
“Good” versus “evil”
The Opposition take for granted their self-appointment to the “good” side of the political narrative. This has morphed from being an earned perception in the aftermath of their EDSA “revolution” in 1986 to the perverse entitlement that they regard it to be today. They spend an inordinate amount of resources rabidly protecting what has now become an artificial perception.
No less than the Roman Catholic Church itself has lost ascendancy to the claim of authority over deeming anything “good” or “evil”. So who do the Yellowtards think they are presuming to appoint themselves as the “good” in today’s politics?
Arresting “economic decline”
This story implies that the Duterte administration is the singular cause of the Philippines’ poor economic performance over the last couple of years. They then assert that ending the Duterte era — presumably paving the way for a return of the Yellowtard era — will be the cause of a promising economic outlook over the following years.
This is no different to the assertions they made back in the 1980s that aimed to mislead Filipinos into thinking that then President Ferdinand Marcos and his “Martial Law Regime” was the singular cause of all Filipinos’ and their nation’s troubles. It was Filipinos’ collective realisation over the last 30 years that nothing about their society had fundamentally changed under the Yellowtard watch that eventually flipped their sentiments over to the “evil” side.
A national economy is a complex system. Establishing sound cause-and-effect relationships between its input and output factors requires a huge amount of science and computing power. Even the world’s most renowned “economists” get it wrong most of the time. For a party of bird-brained partisans and “activists” to be attributing causal relationships between presidents and the movements of an entire national economy is an exercise in intellectual dishonesty to say the least.
“Never again”
An event or situation that happened or emerged in the past did so under circumstances unique to that period in time. To attribute the possibility of the same thing or situation happening or emerging because of a cherry-picked instigator is a logical fallacy. To actively propagate a political narrative that is underpinned by that fallacious argument is downright crooked.
To cite a specific case, the Opposition like to single out former Senator Bongbong Marcos as the bogeyman in their shrill narrative of “another Marcos” coming to power and heralding another “dark age” of authoritarianism. It’s an emotionally attractive scare tactic but is utter nonsense. The “Martial Law Regime” was a conflation of many events and actors unique to the 1970s. “Another Marcos” in Malacanang alone cannot account for the possibility that all that could happen again. Thus, the idea that preventing “another Marcos” ascending power will ensure that all that will “never again” happen is plain idiotic.
Indeed, it does not take “another Marcos” to implement another “Martial Law Regime” because all the legal avenues to do that are still available under the 1987 Yellowtard Constitution.
* * *
The Opposition lost an entire nation and continue to lose in general because they are purposely insulting the intelligence of the Filipino people. Perhaps not everyone can overcome their instinctive responses to the emotional appeals of their dishonest “thought leaders” who infest schools, the Church, and the country’s mainstream media industry. However there already seems to be a critical mass of voters who can see right through the ineffective messaging that Opposition politicians are addicted to and continue to use in their campaigns.
It is easy to see that the Yellowtards are not planning beyond the 2022 elections. If they were truly honest about their spiel that they are in this for the good of the people, what is their plan over the six years that follow after the 2022 elections? Ask them that question and all you’ll get are crickets.",Politics

Did her appointees think twice about entering into deals with cronies of former President Ferdinand Marcos and other scams which defrauded taxpayers? Did the emphasis on religion have any effect on the oligarchs who replaced the Marcos cronies? Not by any minuscule measure.
The Opposition has really run out of ideas because they’re running plays from their old playbook. This is why Marcos is at center stage again in comparison with President Rodrigo Duterte. It’s guilt by association. You can’t help the feeling of deja vu when you see the success of Build, Build, Build and the biggest increase in spending for social services post-Marcos and, yet, the Opposition is still bent on demonizing the President.
Chanco asserts that Leni Robredo is the leader we need. Not for anything but isn’t Robredo committing a sin by engaging in a relationship with a married man? They can try to bury this all they want but it’s an open secret as far as the public is concerned. This doesn’t make Robredo any different from our other politicos who are Lotharios in real life. At least, they aren’t hypocrites like she is.
In 2015, Rappler came out with a story that it thought would be enough to damage Duterte’s reputation — a piece about the accusations leveled by his wife when she filed for a declaration of nullity of marriage. It became a non-issue with Duterte coming clean with his relationship with Honeylet Avanceña and their daughter, Kitty. End of story. The public accepted that reality of Duterte’s personal life. In fact, they identified with it because some of them are in the same boat due to the absence of a divorce law. Robredo, on the other hand, is being packaged as a saint by people like Chanco when she doesn’t even come close to being one.
The Opposition uses religion whenever convenient. They have a special dispensation from the Catholic hierarchy in the country, specifically from Soc Villegas and Broderick Pabillo. This is actually very disrespectful of the Filipino whom the Opposition regard as stupid enough to fall for this kind of propaganda up to now. We fell for that when Cory was up against Marcos — a time when the Church was still very influential. The “good” versus “evil” narrative is worn thin to the point that it’s so sheer that Pinoys can see through it now. The truth is the Duterte administration has achieved more in five years than the thirty years the Yellowidiots were in power. It is not about form. It is about substance and impact on the lives of ordinary Filipinos.
God has a way of rendering justice to the oppressed and to those who use His name in vain. But you have to give it to the Opposition to be so evil to the point of being unconscionable. This is their true character. Diabolical.",Politics
"Duterte SLAM-DUNK throws Yellowtard “Opposition” in chaos, forces Robredo to run for president!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/duterte-slam-dunk-throws-yellowtard-opposition-in-chaos-forces-robredo-to-run-for-president/,"It is clearly evident now that the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc within it rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and their lackeys in Big Corporate Media have been taken for a ride by the camp of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte. Months of seeming “chaos” within their loose community of family and party factions delivered various left and right feints that baited Opposition “thought leaders” and “political consultants” all too eager to come up with the sophomoric “analyses” of the week. So effective was this baiting and so rabidly have many bitten into these hooks that the shrill Titas of Manila now find themselves thrashing in bewilderment over what’s happening today.
The girls of the Opposition had, in effect, been mounting a futile and uncoordinated full-court-press against the incumbent camp’s gentle but elegantly-executed frolic to the goal. They had their guards up and teeth bared against every little outrage fad they perceived of every move by admin actors and so-called “enablers”. They swung at every decoy, flinched at every lunge and, ultimately, were caught flat-footed as the admin went for the slam-dunk today. And now here is Leni Robredo, “vice president” and titular “leader” of the fantasy that is the “United Opposition”, attempting to block the ball after that in-your-face score.
Earlier, following his surprise endorsement of aide Bong Go’s candidacy for vice president, President Duterte reportedly confirmed that his daughter, Inday Sara will run for president despite the latter filing her certificate of candidacy for re-election as Davao City Mayor yesterday. Considering that Ms Duterte has, as of this writing, not confirmed that, could it be that Robredo’s confirmation of her presidential bid is yet another foolish Yellowtard bite into yet another cleverly-orchestrated Duterte feint?
Either way, cat’s out of the bag. Robredo has effectively tilted Yellowtardom into a fatal unpowered dive into oblivion by announcing her ill-thought-out candidacy. Robredo does not stand a chance in the presidential race whether “Daughterte” guns for the presidency or not. With her sure-loss in 2022 will come the final nail driven into the Yellowtard coffin. In her piece “Grace #Halalan2022”, one of the few Opposition thought leaders who actually applies a lucid mind to her regard for the desperate position the Opposition find themselves in today, Katrina Stuart-Santiago writes…
Liberal actors throw around labels like “enabler” and “trapo” forgetting that we can list down as many from the Liberal side who are both, but more importantly failing to realize that this WILL NOT TRANSLATE to votes for VP Leni. It also only reminds us of the Liberals’ false purity politics and the moral highground that defined the elitism of the PNoy years.
Despite huffing and puffing on the defense all through the admin camp’s stroll to the goal, all the Opposition could come me up with are lame candidates. Worse, they had no game plan to effect convincing scores in the unlikely event they took possession of the ball. What next now that Leni Robredo and her Yellowtard lot are locked into a path while the Duterte camp still enjoys a multitude of options to play?

Leni Robredo’s PHANTOM “voter base” that “won” her the VP seat in 2016 nowhere to be found today!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredos-phantom-voter-base-that-won-her-the-vp-seat-in-2016-nowhere-to-be-found-today/,"I don’t usually write about Leni Robredo. I have as much disdain for her as Mar Roxas because they are too plastic for my political taste. Robredo is the same as Isko Moreno Domagoso as they are packaged candidates for the Presidency. Their track record is hype and their experience forged on social media — Facebook for Domagoso and Twitter for Robredo. Robredo’s track record in Congress was mediocre at best. What can you expect when you have Bolet Banal as your mentor? Her achievements as Vice-President are PR snow jobs which haven’t been replicated even at a local government unit (LGU) level because they are not scalable. They are all mere palliatives that are meant for temporary relief not for maximum impact but more for the furtherance of her image as the “Busy Presidente”.
I believe Robredo will announce her candidacy for President today because she will again allow herself to be used as a political pawn just like she did in 2016. She has vowed to run if Marcos does so she will make her date with “destiny” again today on this basis. Robredo’s problem is five years after her “victory” in 2016, her voter base is still nowhere to be found. If it existed, she would have at least 14 million in command votes to build on and her political endorsement could have at least produced a Senator in the 2019 midterm election. That turned out to be a debacle for her eight candidates. Not even Chinese numerology could help even one land in the Senate, including that Ninoy Aquino cosplayer, Bam Aquino.
Robredo’s candidacy means the Yellowidiots’ purist minority will get who they want to vote for. Without SmartMagic this time around, she might even reach the same vote count she did in 2016. There will be no come from behind victory this time around. She also has two major hindrances, campaign financing and a running mate. The usual donors will give the token sum but none will bankroll her campaign because she’s not a sure win and more likely to be loser. Her predicament is largely of her making because she didn’t step up to the leadership plate after 2016. Mar Roxas lost and that closed the checkbook of Judy Araneta Roxas. Former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino was too shell-shocked by Duterte’s win that he faded into obscurity and into failing health resulting in his early demise. The Cory branch of the Cojuangco clan aren’t exactly astute businessmen like their estranged cousin Danding. It didn’t help that Kiko Pangilinan as the new party president also did nothing to map out a strategy with Robredo to keep the Liberals relevant.
The only hail mary pass Robredo has is Kris Aquino becoming her running mate. The natural political heiress of Ninoy can appeal to the masa up to an extent and also raise funds from her showbiz friends. But this is both in a limited capacity. It still wouldn’t be enough to put them over the top. Robredo isn’t likely to eat into the votes of Bongbong Marcos or Ping Lacson nor can she present herself as the better alternative to the two. She will compete with Domagoso and Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao for the undecideds but when the debates come into the equation, the public will be ultimately left with a choice between Lacson or Marcos.
The Yellowidiots are of the belief that they can win because of the youth and millennial demographic. That was the same justification they had for their loss in 2019. They would’ve gotten the youth vote “if only they were registered” we are told. This won’t be available to them this time around because the long lines for voter registration and the clamor for its extension indicate the turnout will be high because the public is very interested in exercising their right to decide their future. The disruption and resulting uncertainty wrought by the pandemic has compelled them to participate in deciding their future at this crucial juncture in their lives. Voters will be looking at platforms not personalities.
The weakness of the Opposition lies in their focus on old issues with particular priority given to that of Marcos and the incumbent President’s “fascist”, “authoritarian”, and “tyrannical dictatorship” which only exists as a figment of their stunted collective imagination. Whether this narrative appeals to their target demographic remains to be seen but the outlook isn’t bright when ranged up against what will be the detailed platforms of more seasoned candidates such as Lacson and Marcos. It was Duterte who broke the mold of transactional politics in 2016 up to a certain extent. In his PhilSTAR piece “Even”, Alex Magno points out that it’s high time that the political structure be reformed to prevent plurality candidates which fosters divisiveness led by the politicians who lost in the last election. He cites how ours is a “thoroughly idiotic way to have an electoral democracy” where “[every] elected ‘minority’ president can only govern by way of makeshift coalitions shaped by short-term interests. Therefore, every elected president needs to engage in transactional politics. Those coalitions unravel at the end of each electoral cycle.” Thus, Magno observes…
From her own utterance, however, it seems Leni’s greatest concern is that her running might inadvertently divide the non-Duterte vote even more, resulting in the defeat of all of them. From the survey numbers, she is correct on this point. If she follows her gut feel, she would promptly fly back to Camarines Sur.
But her gut feel may not matter. A crowd of self-anointed powerbrokers has gathered around her, pressuring her to run – even if this may be against statistical logic. A desperate group of politicians hang perilously from her hemlines, fearful of being orphaned if she withdraws from the game.
A parliamentary system is more suitable and allows for the no-confidence vote which facilitates the transition of leadership when required without disrupting government and continuity. It is also more conducive to political stability which is high on the criteria of foreign investors. Robredo announcing her candidacy for President today won’t be a surprise. What will be if she decides to not to run is, instead, seek the governorship of Camarines Sur. After all, Robredo isn’t sincere when she talks of the laylayan or the Filipinos who are the most marginalized in society. They are mere props to her image. Leni is only concerned about Leni Robredo’s Political Career. Whatever decision she makes today her fate is already certain. Either way she is consigned to political oblivion because that is the fate reserved for political pretenders.",Politics
"Vote for Noynoy because he’s an Aquino, don’t vote for Bongbong because he is a Marcos",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/vote-for-noynoy-because-hes-an-aquino-dont-vote-for-bongbong-because-he-is-a-marcos/,"Aren’t Filipinos already tired of the primitive logic of the Yellowtards? That camp misled Filipinos into voting no less than two Aquinos to the presidency on the sole merit of their being respectively spouse to and son of former senator and “national hero” Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. Now here they are again misleading Filipinos with the notion that Bongbong Marcos should not be an option for president just because he is his father’s son.
Basing one’s vote (or non-vote) on who one’s father was seems to be the preferred intellectually-bankrupt ideology of the Yellowtards. This is likely the reason why former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and former President Fidel Ramos have gone scot-free despite being directly complicit in the execution of the alleged Martial Law “atrocities” that the Yellowtards keep whining about. It’s because the Yellowtards who lorded over the national narrative for 30 years conveniently turned a blind eye to the accountability of the Martial Law Defense Minister and his then Armed Forces chief.
The Yellowtards, instead, set their sights on the Marcos children — Imee and Bongbong specifically. That was both dishonest (considering Enrile’s and Ramos’s clearer accountabilities) and, more importantly, a waste of their time. Despite the constant potshots they took agains the Marcos children, they nonetheless went on to become successful politicians. The most recent culmination of the political success that the Marcos kids scored was Bongbong’s coming really close to the vice presidency in 2016. Indeed, many Filipinos remain convinced that the “winner” back then, “vice president” Leni Robedo, only scraped past Marcos’s numbers with the crooked help of then Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman Andy Bautista and his Smartmatic henchmen.
Today, Bongbong Marcos stands as the most winnable amongst this crop of presidential candidates counted among whom are an inarticulate former That’s Entertainment boylet, a possibly-concussed boxing champ, and a “United Opposition” leader wannabe. Thirty years of demonising the Marcoses was, indeed, a colossal waste of time and energy. Worse, all that energy spent by the Yellowtards on propagating their fake version of historical context for three decades could have instead been channeled towards a forward-looking agenda. This neglect to build a strategic vision is evident today. The Yellowtards have no platform other than to demonise Bongbong Marcos for the merely being “another Marcos”. That is about the biggest insult to the intelligence of the Filipino voter on exhibit.
It’s payback time. The Yellowtards will have to come to terms with the fact that the decades-long intellectual dishonesty they had perpetrated together with their cronies in Big Corporate Media comes at a cost. The intellectual bankruptcy of their politics, the one-dimensionality of their rhetoric, and the vacuousness of their value proposition to the Filipino people are on display today for all to laugh at. Their presumptive “leader”, Leni Robredo, is no more than a quaint punchline in the memes and tweets that proliferate calling out her Madumb-ness.",Politics
2022 election campaign exposes severe lack of leadership and public administration talent in Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/2022-election-campaign-exposes-severe-lack-of-leadership-and-public-administration-talent-in-philippine-politics/,"A stoic friend commented about the incestuous nature of Philippine politics. On one hand we have septuagenarians running for the two top posts who are competent and qualified. On the other, we have forty-somethings who are not. What does this say about our politics and leadership development in political institutions? We’re not at par with Singapore which grooms members of parliament for higher posts. A parliamentary system enables a member to learn the rudiments of legislation in preparation to becoming a member of the bureaucracy which allows him to gain experience in how the system works. Singapore members of parliament (MPs) are encouraged to pursue continuing education. As such, they usually have anywhere between one to three post-graduate degrees tucked under their belt by the time they are appointed to head ministries. This is a far cry from what we have here. We have bureaucrats who have post-graduate degrees but no experience in the private sector which works to their detriment since their mindset is still the usual lack of sense of urgency and more bureaucracy.
A case in point is a state college that has been without a President for more than a year just because of the delays in the search committee convened by the Board of Trustees in getting their work done. Going into the last phase of the process will take them another thirty days. Whoever is selected, the next President will have to work with the existing budget and will need to wait eight months again for the next budget season to submit to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It’s only in his second year that he can actually implement his development goals and he’s given only two four-year terms. Reappointment is rightly based on his performance but he does have a particular disadvantage given the time it takes for his required budget to be approved and it is also certain that he won’t receive the full request.
Former President Ferdinand Marcos was conscious of this fact which is why he placed the onus of leadership development on Onofre Corpuz who promptly set-up the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) as the training ground for bureaucrats and future leaders of the country. Sadly the DAP has fallen by the wayside as its own bureaucracy has been riddled with political appointments. The present political structure doesn’t allow new leaders to come up the ladder. Political dynasties have thrived post-Marcos despite the promise of Cory Aquino to do away with them. The ban is stipulated in the 1987 Constitution but there is no enabling law which has been passed by Congress for obvious reasons.
Even the party-list system which is supposed to be an avenue for marginalized sectors to gain representation has been abused by leftist-militant groups and mainstream political dynasties. The House of Representatives has been reduced to a cornucopia of party-list groups which resemble sari-sari stores. There is no control mechanism and corruption at the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has enabled these party-list groups to win seats by reaching the minimum vote threshold set by law. It’s about time that the political structure is reformed to take into account these exigencies. At present the shallowness of the political talent pool is being felt as we have recycled Senators and Congressmen. What’s worse is dynasties rule at the local level specially in the regions. This is why there is minuscule development at that level.
It’s about time that we take stock of what’s needed to become competitive in attracting foreign direct investment. The pandemic has shown the weak underbelly of the economy in terms of economic activities being concentrated in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). This has to change along with the leadership development program if the country is to become truly progressive and development goals achieved.",Politics
"Yellowtards to the rest of Filipinos: If you do not wear pink, you are NOT one of us",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/yellowtards-to-the-rest-of-filipinos-if-you-do-not-wear-pink-you-are-not-one-of-us/,"The notable thing surrounding Leni Robredo’s announcement today of her candidacy for president is her camp’s latest political colour. They’ve chosen pink — the new Yellowtard colour. Called to wear pink today, Robredo’s supporters seemingly obliged. The mystery, however, persists: Why pink?
Evidently, the answer to that question ultimately does not matter to Robredo’s followers. They basically just do as they are told. That makes sense considering there really isn’t much substance or rationale to Robredo’s bid for the Philippines’ highest office. She, after all, took months to decide, basically proving that it was more validation from her party and endorsement from the who’s-who of Yellowtard power brokers that figured in her brainstemstorming than any sort of conviction or vision for the Philippines. Indeed, Robredo confirmed the other day that her decision to run has more to do with with hindering an outcome rather than achieving an outcome. The Inquirer earlier reported that Robredo “made it clear that preventing Duterte’s style of governance remains her top concern when deciding whether to run for higher office.” Before that, the Omidyar Network’s Philippine outpost Rappler “reported” that Robredo’s decision to run is premised on “being chosen as the standard-bearer of a united opposition or the presidential bid of her rival and the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos’s son, Bongbong.”
Beyond those bratty reasons to run for president, it remains a mystery as to what Robredo envisions the Philippines to be after six years of her proposed presidency. She just wants those six years to be neither a Duterte nor Marcos “regime”. Makes sense. right? It does, if you are a Yellowtard. Viewed from the Yellowtard perspective, everything that stands in the way of their clawing back into Malacanang is a “fascist”. And, to them, fascists are anyone who is not a Yellowtard. This exclusive approach to election campaign had lost them an entire nation in the 2016 and 2019 elections. It seems the Yellowtards still haven’t learnt the most important equation in the science of electioneering:
My Voter Base + Converted Voters = MORE VOTERS
By framing their campaign as anti-non-Yellowtard, the Yellowtards are basically writing off a vast base of voters that could potentially be converted. Worse, by attaching themselves to a gender- or sexual-orientation-charged colour like pink, they had all but tribalised their political brand. Democratic politics is, after all, addition. The Yellowtards, being the stubborn bunch of morons that they are, insist it is subtraction. They would rather see the exclusion of a huge base of potential voters than open their doors to their inclusion. That gives us a flavour of what a Yellowtard return to power will mean for Filipinos. In essence, the Yellowtards are telling all the rest of us: If you don’t wear pink, you are NOT one of us.
One begins to wonder then whether the taipans and oligarchs who bankroll Leni Robredo’s presidential candidacy are really aware of how much the Yellowtards have set her up to fail with the moronic campaign strategy they now have in effect. Have these rich folk stopped to consider whether they will get the returns on their investment in Robredo? Perhaps they would be better off investing their billions in the money market instead where a safe but comfy return can be reasonably expected.
So, again, why pink? They Yellowtards don’t have an answer to that, which is bizarre considering that this was supposedly a branding decision made by the best marketing minds of Yellowtardom. Food for thought in line with that comes, instead, from the ol’ reliable editor of the Tribune in her piece, “Leni turns pink”…
Robredo’s choice of pink as a makeover also feeds suspicions since in the political realm, the hue is associated with socialists or the middle-left wing that could indicate coopting with radical groups.
Her camp is trying to build up public traction by stirring up anticipation until 8 October, when she will supposedly make up her mind on next year’s polls.
The effort to create a dramatic effect plus the sudden change in the party suit paints an image of indecisiveness that is a reminder of the gross failure of the previous yellow regime.
Now that makes perfect sense.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s pink song-and-dance candidacy announcement masks her treachery against the Liberal Party,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredos-pink-song-and-dance-candidacy-announcement-masks-her-treachery-against-the-liberal-party/,"There was much rejoicing among the Yellowidiots yesterday. Their idol and symbol, Leni Robredo, finally confirmed what the public knew as fact already even before she made her announcement; she’s running for President. The Opposition went through convoluted contortions in their process of “selection”. “Unity” coalition 1Sambayan was established as a convenor group, to determine who would be the standard-bearer in the Presidential race for inclusivity among those opposed to the Duterte administration. No sooner had 1Sambayan announced the names of potential candidates did the same begin issuing statements that gave the impression that they would not be running. It was only Sen. Ping Lacson who formally begged off from the process because for him to agree to be included would be hypocritical on his part considering he was one of the principal sponsors of the Anti-Terrorism Bill in the Senate which the 1Sambayan convenors were opposed to. Isko Moreno didn’t beg off but said, also by way of a letter, that he was focusing on Manila’s pandemic response for the time being. All this transpired in June.
Robredo’s goal of “unifying the opposition” against President Rodrigo Duterte was apparently premised on the other presidentiables giving way to her. This was absurd because why would anyone seriously considering a presidential candidacy give way to another who is rating lower than him? In the specific case of Lacson, while Robredo registered higher survey numbers, Lacson’s approach to his candidacy was more strategic. Senate President Tito Sotto was going to be his running mate and he had the support of Renato De Villa and other retired senior Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officers and Congressman Bebot Alvarez of Reporma. This is evident because while the Opposition is in disarray and only organizing now, the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) of Sotto and Lacson’s Reporma have joined forces to form a broad political coalition. Today they are signing another strategic alliance with the National Unity Party of Ronnie Puno, who has also been announced as their campaign manager.
The Yellowidiots certainly made a show of it yesterday at Robredo’s office. Other presidential candidates didn’t mount a production on the same scale as Robredo. Their campaign color is pink. Instead of a flag pin on the left side of her chest, Robredo wore a pink ribbon. So much for her love of country, right? Robredo also packaged herself as the nanay ng bayan (“mother of the nation”). The analogy she made was the country was a battered wife who, after suffering so much at the hands of her husband for the sake of her children, had finally decided to fight back. Obviously, she was referring to Duterte as the abuser. The Yellow acolytes lapped all of this up. Never mind that, as an economist-lawyer, Robredo didn’t give an idea of how she intended to solve the country’s problems as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic.
There was also the anomaly of her running as an independent when she filed her certificate of candidacy in the afternoon. She didn’t resign as Chair of the Liberal Party. Per the press release, she was running as an independent for “inclusivity” whatever that meant in their context which no one could figure out. Yesterday’s event was more of an appeal to public emotion than one where a political crusade was supposed to be launched for an election which is crucial for a country whose economy has been battered by the pandemic. It was also meant to highlight the “authoritarian”, “fascist”, “tyrannical dictatorship” of Duterte amongst the leftist-liberals making up Robredo’s support base. As far as Robredo and her ilk are concerned, they are the “genuine opposition”. All the rest are “Duterte-enablers”. It remains to be seen how this will play out as the electoral campaign progresses.
Robredo’s choice of Sen. Kiko Pangilinan as her running mate doesn’t bring any strategic advantage to their ticket. Pangilinan’s voter base consists of the fans of his wife Sharon “The Megastar” Cuneta. But the same would have a different view of the election in the context of the highest post in the land. It is not a base that the two can rely on. Robredo’s voter base is virtually non-existent. Her “victory” in 2016 should’ve come with command votes that she could’ve grown in the last five years. What’s striking is the fact that Bongbong Marcos continues to rank ahead of her in surveys even if he “lost” the 2016 Vice-Presidential race.
It is now a five-man race similar to 2016. More than likely we will have a plurality President again if the other candidates don’t withdraw or slide down to VP by joining the stronger tickets. At this point, the administration is also in a flux as Bongbong Marcos is without a VP. Bong Go is without a Presidential candidate. There is no word about a coalition between the two. The Partido Federal under which Marcos is running was formed by Agrarian Reform Secretary John Castricciones. By far the most organized political coalition is NPC-Reporma-NUP. It also has the best machinery on the ground and will be fielding a full Senate slate of twelve candidates. The politikaserye goes on.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s bid for the presidency is doomed because of her hypocrisy and lame platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredos-bid-for-the-presidency-is-doomed-because-of-her-hypocrisy-and-lame-platform/,"After months of deliberation, current Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo finally filed her certificate of candidacy to run for President in the 2022 Presidential elections. She has been hesitant to run because she didn’t want several candidates to go up against President Rodrigo Duterte’s presidential bet. She didn’t want the Opposition vote to be spread across several candidates. She wanted a single Opposition candidate essential to beating a popular incumbent camp. The problem is, Robredo wanted other Presidential candidates like Senators Manny Pacquiao and Ping Lacson and Manila City Mayor Isko Moreno to give way to her. She wanted to be the sole representative of the Opposition. Needless to say, none of them obliged. Why should they? They have their own ambitions and they know she is a lame duck.
Robredo also launched her new brand during her filing for candidacy. She ditched the traditional yellow motif of her camp and sported a pink mask and had a pink ribbon pinned to her chest. We can’t help but ask, what the heck happened to Robredo? Did she abandon the Liberal Party? Or, rather, did the Liberal party stop supporting her bid for the Presidency? More importantly, is there still a Liberal party? Why is Robredo now wearing pink when she was a loud and proud Yellow? By ditching the yellow color, Robredo inadvertently admitted that the yellow colour, which is very much associated with the Liberal Party, heralds the losing team.
Robredo has, indeed, filed for her certificate of candidacy as an independent. As far as I know, Robredo hasn’t formally announced that she has left the Liberal Party. As far as I know Robredo is still the leader of the Opposition and continues to be chairman of the Liberal Party. It is quite baffling why she has pulled yet another stunt and switched to the color pink. This is not a good sign at all. What it shows is Robredo’s lack of consistency and conviction.
What does pink stand for to Robredo anyway? The Cancer Council use the pink ribbon campaign to raise awareness about breast and gynaecological cancers, as well as raise funds for prevention programs. As usual, Team Robredo’s lack of originality is on display yet again. At least the yellow ribbon meant something to the Aquinos, something about Ninoy tying a yellow ribbon for Cory and all that crap.
This is not the first time Robredo and her Liberal party mates changed colors. They switched to a white motif during the 2019 mid-term elections after the Liberal Party lost control. That obviously didn’t help their campaign either because all their senatorial bets including former Senator Bam Aquino and former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas lost. The constant rebranding and switching colors to “symbolize” what they stand for only means they don’t stand for anything. They try to fool the public with imagery gimmicks but they are only fooling themselves.
A Robredo supporter even mocked her critics saying that it will be hard to criticize her as Dilawan or yellow because she is now wearing pink. That’s silly because Robredo wearing pink doesn’t change what she is. The yellow brand is forever etched in people’s minds because that’s what she and the Liberal Party used to sell hard to the public.
Robredo and her supporters are glossing over the fact that the Liberal Party is dead. How can people trust her and her team to lead a country when they can’t even form a coalition or forge an alliance with other Presidential candidates? The fact that Robredo couldn’t command an audience with any of the other Presidential candidates (yes, they snubbed her) means her envirioned administration (God forbid!) will be nothing short of a disaster. Robredo will not get respect from the military and police forces — agencies that are led mostly by men. After all, the Philippines is still a boy’s club and there is no way Robredo will be welcome in that club since she behaves like a tweetums — a woman putting forth a meek and weak persona with manipulative intent. In other words, Robredo doesn’t come across as someone strong, which is not good for a country of over 100 million people.
Robredo said that she decided to run for the Presidency in a bid to “stop the Marcoses from returning to power and to prevent another brand of governance similar to President Rodrigo Duterte.” She probably thinks she can win against former Senator Bongbong Marcos. That’s a bit too naïve of her considering she won’t be running with the help of the Liberal Party machinery the same way she did during the 2016 Presidential Elections when the Liberal Party still had control over the country’s coffers and had allies in every agency including the Commission on Elections. We all know that former COMELEC Chairman Andy Bautista is now on the run from the law and is in no position to help her “win”. Besides, with Pacquiao, Lacson, and Moreno running for the presidency and each one of them being more popular than her, she’s got very low chance of success. Last I heard, Marcos still enjoys a solid base of supporters.
I suppose with Robredo running for the 2022 Presidency, we will know once and for all if she really did win the Vice Presidency in 2016. There had since been only one way to find out if she really did get 14 million votes in that election since the electoral tribunal did not provide any closure to Marcos’s election protests claiming Robredo’s win was fraudulent. Marcos now running for the presidency against Robredo opens up that way to find out once and for all. Polls conducted by reputable over the last several years told of how Marcos sustained his voter base while Robredo evidently never had one up to scratch to begin with. The 2019 elections in which all eight candidates endorsed by Robredo lost told the same story. This coming election in May 2022 will tell us the same story.",Politics
Why be pink when you can be FILIPINO?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/why-be-pink-when-you-can-be-filipino/,"The rebranding of the Yellowtard cause around the colour pink represents a massive misreading of the pulse and character of the Filipino people. For so long, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans within it rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) expressed bafflement over the continued popularity of incumbent Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Unfortunately for them, that vexation had not translated to curiosity and that curiosity into actionable insight that serves their “cause”.
The fact is, Filipino culture remains a culture of machismo. Ana P. Santos, in her June 2018 piece “The Price of ‘Machismo Populism’ in the Philippines” for The Atlantic, describes “a sexist strain that has long festered just beneath the surface” of “polite” Philippine society that Duterte taps to sustain his popularity. Santos further observes…
Male action stars popularized in Philippines’ cinema and telenovelas who save the day seemingly using nothing more than braggadocio, and noontime variety shows where scantily clad women dance and male hosts flirt with them, glorify machismo and normalize sexist behavior.
Indeed, this makes the Yellowtards’ cozy relationship with Big Corporate Media even more interesting when one considers the hundreds of millions of pesos in profits these media companies have made on the back of low-cost productions that regurgitate action star and kalaswaan tropes that keep Filipino audiences hooked. This does not include the mind-numbing noontime variety shows that made stars of the likes of Vice Ganda, Maine Mendoza, the Tito-Vic-and-Joey trio, and Kris Aquino. Right in the ingrained mediocrity and exploitation culture of Big Media and the symbiotic relationship the Yellowtards maintain with their oligarchs shareholders and the celebrities whose careers they prop up lies the profound hypocrisy of this disente camp.
More important, however, is the curious fact that Yellowtardom’s “thought leaders” and campaign strategists had all but failed to apply the marketing wisdom of their media henchwomen to their own desperate campaign to seize power legally as the 2022 national elections approach.  The pink ribbon that presumptive leader of the Philippines’ “United Opposition” sports nowadays presumably represents the plight of the country’s “victimised” women consistent to the context Santos paints in her Atlantic piece. Indeed, they go as far as suggesting that Filipinos today suffer a form of “battered wife” syndrome. In his Inquirer piece “The will to fight back”, Professor Randy David writes of “why [‘vice president’ Leni Robredo is] running for president and why the nation desperately needs someone like her at this time.”
The metaphor she employs references the complex situation of countless victims of domestic violence. Without saying so explicitly, she likens the Filipino public’s forbearance with Mr. Duterte’s incompetent and violent presidency to the deep ambivalence that women experience when the men they chose to love and raise a family with turned out to be dissolute tyrants. They continue to love their abusers, offer excuses for their repugnant behavior, and hang on to every little sign that they are at heart good persons.
Under this light, it becomes easy to see why the Yellowtard campaign is underpinned by an ill-thought-out strategy that dooms it to failure.
First of all, the Feminist Card at play in the branding of the Opposition bid targets only half of the voting population — women. Second, of that female population, only a minority set  would consist of members who would consider themselves in abusive relationships. The Union of Catholic Asian News reports that only “one in four Filipino women aged 15-49 has experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse by their partner or husband.” On this back-of-an-envelope reckoning alone, could be gleaned that Robredo’s ill-fated campaign would directly resonate with less than 13 percent (one fourth of the female vote) of qualified Filipino voters. That is a clear set up for failure.
This is the whole trouble with the elitist mindset of Yellowtardom that was forged over years of shrill chatter within their echo chambers and chi chi private-school-along-Katipunan-Road conferences and forums. They have come to regard Philippine society through the yellow- (and now pink-) tinted lens of Western European and coastal North American woke culture where every fluidity, equality, and other nebulous gender-prefixed notion, when shouted out, serve as calls to “activist” action (or prayer).
It really comes down to what pink actually means to the Filipino. Has there ever been anything in Filipino culture that was symbolised by this colour? No? Why pink then? It seems the Yellowtards and the broader Philippine Opposition that they infest are in the midst of an appeal to voters that seeks to espouse anything but what really matters to the ordinary Filipino.",Politics
Lacson-Sotto tandem under NPC-Reporma-NUP coalition gains traction amidst fragmented admin and Opposition camps,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/lacson-sotto-tandem-under-npc-reporma-nup-coalition-gains-traction-amidst-fragmented-admin-and-opposition-camps/,"Both the opposition and the administration are fragmented for the simple reason that their oligarch supporters and political kingmakers decided to each go on their own. In the case of the Opposition, two horses are being run; Leni Robredo and Isko Moreno Domagoso. In the case of the administration, President Rodrigo Duterte wanted Inday Sara “Daughterte” to run but she wouldn’t if not on her own terms. By Daighterte’s terms, this means no Davao Origs running her campaign and not under the PDP-Laban party.
There were reports last Friday that a compromise had been reached and Jun Evasco would file a certificate of candidacy (COC) on her behalf but something happened which made her back out with finality. Whatever it is, PDP-Laban had to file so Senator Bato dela Rosa was the designated substitute. The National Unity Party (NUP) has gone for the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto while Lakas and the Nacionalistas continue to be silent about who they’re supporting for President. Bongbong Marcos (BBM) has filed under Partido Federal — not even with Nacionalista nor the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL). He remains isolated because he doesn’t really have a party membership base. What he does have is close advisers of his father who are still alive. These would be Titong Mendoza, Juan Ponce Enrile and Lolong Lazaro.
The kingmaker who has been silent the whole time is former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). She didn’t even bother to file her COC personally. She had meetings with both Daughterte and Marcos but she hasn’t made any public statement about who she’s backing for President. This makes for a very fluid political environment. GMA has her lieutenants spread out over three major political parties; Lakas, PDP-Laban and NUP.
In the meantime, the political party which has been orphaned by the death of its Chairman Emeritus Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. has emerged as the most serious challenger to the administration. Senate President Tito Sotto has been able to cobble together a powerhouse coalition with Reporma and the NUP. Between Sotto and Congressman Bebot Alvarez, they have access to a national network of Congressmen and local government unit (LGU) heads whom they can tap to strengthen their ground machinery. In fact, the NPC-Reporma-NUP combine is the most organized coalition when compared to the administration and the opposition.
Sotto divulged the other day in an Inquirer interview that Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, Kris Aquino and Bam Aquino all begged off as Robredo’s VP candidate. This was to dispel reports that there were negotiations for Sen. Ping Lacson to slide down as VP or run for reelection as Senator instead to accomodate Vice-President Leni Robredo’s request for a unified slate. Sotto reiterated to the Inquirer that the Lacson-Sotto ticket is cast in stone no matter who else runs for President and Vice-President.
What is ironic now in this election cycle is the fact that a coalition which is neither pro-Opposition nor pro-Administration, is actually the best organized and is in a strong position to challenge both the administration and Opposition candidates for the 2022 election. By November 15, the political picture should be clearer but both the opposition and the administration will have a lot of catching up to do with NPC-Reporma-NUP which has laid the groundwork for their campaign towards victory on May 9, 2022.",Politics
"#Halalan2022, Leni Robredo’s so-called “crowdfunding”, and the COMELEC commissioners Duterte will appoint in Feb 2022",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/halalan2022-leni-robredos-so-called-crowdfunding-and-the-comelec-commissioners-duterte-will-appoint-in-feb-2022/,"The camp of Vice-President Leni Robredo was warned by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) about its crowdfunding drive for her upcoming campaign. Robredo made her announcement to run for president in the 2022 national elections last October 8. Diehard Robredo supporters have formed Team Leni Robredo as the campaign volunteer organization which runs parallel with her official campaign team headed by campaign manager former Sen. Bam Aquino. Team Leni Robredo made a public call for volunteer donations starting at P50.00 up to any amount which an individual can afford.
COMELEC Commissioner Rowena Guanzon drew attention to the crowdfunding initiative because the Omnibus Election Code prohibits candidates from accepting campaign donations from foreign individuals and organizations. This includes Filipinos residing abroad who hold dual citizenship, under which definition they do not qualify because their principal residence is outside of the Philippines. COMELEC Campaign Finance Office (CFO) officer-in-charge Efraim Bag-id also flagged potential flaws in the crowdfunding drive, particularly with regard to identifying the donors. The candidates’ campaigns are required to submit a Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) within the specified period after the conduct of the election. Recall that, in 2016, the Liberal Party was late in submitting its SOCE but was given an extension by then COMELEC Chair Andres Bautista. This was unprecedented. The late submmission or non-submission of the SOCE carries with it the penalty of the disqualifcation of the candidate of the party from holding office and a perpetual ban on public office after.
Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez filed a case questioning the validity of the extension granted by Bautista to the Liberal Party. Nothing eventually came out of it and the winning candidates of the Liberals went on to assume the posts they won in the 2016 election, including Robredo. Bautista went on to resign in the wake of the scandal he found himself in after his wife, Patricia, revealed dozens of bank accounts which allegedly was the fruit of payoffs Bautista received when he was the Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which is tasked with the recovery of the Marcos wealth, as well as those he allegedly received as COMELEC Chair from its automation service provider, Smartmatic. Nothing has come out of the investigation into Bautista’s case and he is in exile in the US even if the two countries have an existing extradition treaty.
Robredo’s Spokesperson, Barry Gutierrez, clarified that the Office of the Vice-President (OVP) was aware of the initiative taken by the volunteers but that the funds raised would not go directly to the OVP. Where would it go then if not for use by the campaign? In the 2016 election, Robredo ran for Vice-President with the full backing of the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. While the election code also prohibits the use of government resources in the campaign, the COMELEC seldom imposes the prohibitions expressly stipulated under the law. The same is true for the Opposition political parties.
The COMELEC is composed of one chair and six commissioners. They are Sheriff Abbas, Rowena Guanzon, Socorro Inting, Marlon Casquejo, Antonio Kho and Aimee Ferolino. Come February 2022, Abbas, Guanzon and Kho will be retiring and the President will be able to appoint replacements to the vacancies which results in all commissioners being appointed by President Duterte. The Opposition could use this against the administration if they don’t do well in the May 2022 polls. Coincidentally, the campaign period officially begins in February also.
In the meantime, the issue of the crowdfunding drive of Team Leni Robredo remains hanging with the eventual resolution most likely being that the monies be privately consolidated and donations turned over by a qualifiied individual or entity to the OVP.",Politics
A return to post-1986 Yellowtard culture? Filipinos will have none of that and none of Leni Robredo,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/a-return-to-post-1986-yellowtard-culture-filipinos-will-have-none-of-that-and-none-of-leni-robredo/,"Pitch her as anything but a “tyrant” and everything about being “pro-poor”, sugar, spice, and everything nice, whatever. Supporting “vice president” Leni Robredo means supporting a return to the Yellowtard society that the 1986 EDSA “revolution” ushered in. Robredo may bathe herself and her camp in pink today, much the same way they did in white in 2019, and in “multi-faith” and “multi-sectoral” colours in between 2016 and that catastrophic year. One way or another the colour Yellow would shine through — and it did, and it still does.
One only need dig up old photos of Robredo and her sidekick Mar Roxas running under the Liberal Party in the lead up to the 2016 national elections. You’d be hard-pressed to find any images not dominated by Yellow. If Robredo and her mob of colour-of-the-day-tards want us to believe that they stand for the very same “rock solid” values and principles they stood for when they went up against then-emerging top candidate Rodrigo Duterte six years ago, they will need to explain why they would not be caught dead today wearing those same yellow colours that symbolised their “cause” at that time. So the colour changes but not the principles at stake? If the principles and values haven’t changed, what does the change in colour mean?
Try as they might, the Yellow brand shines through any fresh colour coating the Yellowtards wash their brand with. Proof of this is in how their attempts to cobble together a “unity” coalition fell flat. It is because their underlying — and unchanged — character could not be concealed by their brand-new pink motif. Why, after all, would one be suddenly ashamed to be associated to a colour they once wore with pride, right? Inconsistent people are phoney. You can’t get any simpler than that. Just as, to their detractors, they will always be Yellowtards, it is evident that, to the likes of Isko Moreno, Manny Pacquiao, and Ping Lacson, Leni Robredo and the 1Sambayan coalition she’s rubbed her brand off on are Yellowtards on the inside.
Why the obsession with a dominant colour to begin with? Among the major parties fielding a presidential candidate, it is only Robredo and her camp that make themselves synonymous with their political colour. The rest may use a colour to differentiate themselves in the race but not necessarily to define themselves by. The Yellowtards have long been obsessed by symbols and hand gestures — perhaps intoxicated by their original lucky strike with the yellow brand, the Laban slogan, and the “L” hand gesture that collectively symbolise the dishonest Aquino-equals-Saintly-Hero narrative they shoved down Filipinos’ throats for three decades. Ultimately, this astounding success went on to become their undoing. Since their loss in 2016, the Yellowtards have turned into desperate chameleons.
Indeed, pink denotes femininity which makes perverse sense when one considers that Robredo is pitching herself to Filipino voters as some sort of mother figure. Worse, the Robredo brand has feminism written all over it — which is bad news from a statistical perspective because that effectively makes her brand a pitch to just half of the voter population. Looking past these colours can be found neither substance nor compelling value proposition. “Let Leni Lead” is the pathetic call to action — as if Robredo’s mob are leaving it up to the Filipino people to find it in their hearts allow themselves to be led by this woman.
Filipinos don’t need a mother. They want a leader. They don’t want some bozo asking them nicely that they allow her to lead them. They want to see a person exhibit some character, step up to the occasion and yell “FOLLOW ME!” with conviction. They are not going to find that in a party or camp that uses a sissy colour, sissy messaging, and sissy personas in lame efforts to come across as the “good” choice in a made-up battle between “good” and “evil”.",Politics
"Opposition infighting cancelling out Isko Moreno and Leni Robredo camps, paving the way for either a Marcos or Lacson win",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/opposition-infighting-cancelling-out-isko-moreno-and-leni-robredo-camps-paving-the-way-for-either-a-marcos-or-lacson-win/,"Too much drama in the Opposition camp. The way Boo Chanco tells it in his PhilSTAR piece “Keep focused” smacks of historical revisionism. According to Chanco, the Reds “tricked” Cory into releasing them after she “ousted” Marcos. He should he call them out for what they really are — political opportunists prostituting their organizations. Their release was the reason why the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) went against the administration just a couple of months after February 1986 which began the string of coup attempts against Cory.
Chanco claims the Reds went for Gringo Honasan and Ping Lacson in 2004 but this is false. The Reds hold RAM responsible for the killings of Rolando Olalia and Lean Alejandro. Lacson was under Col. Rolly Abadilla at the Military Intelligence and Security Group (MISG). What Chanco doesn’t mention is the Reds gained ground under the administration of Fidel Ramos with the peace talks and the passage of the enabling law for party-list representatives which the Reds exploited to the hilt and gave rise to the Makabayan Bloc in the House of Representatives. President Joseph “Erap” Estrada forged a broad coalition in 1998 with Boy Morales and Edicio De La Torre representing the Reds. They dumped Erap for Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and dumped GMA again for Noynoy Aquino. But Akbayan had the upper hand as Ronald Llamas became Political Affairs Adviser of PNoy. In 2010, they coalesced with the Nacionalistas and ran together with Bongbong Marcos for the Senate. Come 2016, they went for Grace Poe and Neri Colmenares was in the same slate as Isko Moreno.
Chanco tries very hard to justify the Senate slate of Leni Robredo but fails. If the basis is the lesser evil then it should comes down to the NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA coalition, some of whose candidates have been adopted by Robredo. Why vote for the Pinklawans when the Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is more organized and has a better platform compared to Robredo and her ilk who still continue to stumble in the dark despite her being Vice-President for the past five years? Voters who are neither pro-Opposition or pro-Administration will consider first the Lacson-Sotto ticket. Surveys haven’t really focused on this niche at all but it is growing. Another consideration is the fact that the 21-45 demographic, which is 40 million strong were born between  2001 – 1977. Those who are 45 were nine years old when Marcos was ousted so they grew up under the Yellows. Those who are 21 were born the year GMA became President. They came of mind during the PNoy administration and as adults under the present administration. For sure, they have witnessed the stark difference in governance.
It’s not likely probable also that this demographic will go for Isko even if he comes from it for the simple reason that those in the upper range will question his ability to lead and govern given his experience and track record. But, as it is, the bickering is inside the Robredo camp and that of Isko, and between the two. The net effect is they are cancelling each other out even before the official campaign period begins. The opposition might as well be branded as the That’s Entertainment group because that’s all they’re good for. The men get separated from the boys and, the way it’s looking, it will be a race between Senators Lacson and Marcos. This is actually more beneficial to the public became there will be no bickering, mudslinging and black propaganda. It will be an issues-based campaign between two gentlemen, which is actually the kind of politics we need.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s #kakamPINK campaign aims to dumb down Filipino voters instead of uplifting the practice of democracy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredos-kakampink-campaign-aims-to-dumb-down-filipino-voters-instead-of-uplifting-the-practice-of-democracy/,"It is ironic that for all the Opposition harping about “democracy”, how it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread, and how it supposedly delivers governments representative of a society’s greater good, it is their camp — specifically the leading Yellowtard bloc within it — that seems to be obsessed with dumbing down the discourse around it. As the campaign for coveted seats coming up for bidding in May 2022 ramps up, there is, as expected, very little talk about platforms and more of the sorts of bickering and mudslinging that lend themselves well to mass media reportage and social media chatter. No surprise there as it is expecting too much of Philippine politics’ players to step up above all that.
Having said that, it is easy to see that amongst all those dumb campaigns, the dumbest of them all is that of the “kakampink” mob of “vice president” Leni Robredo. Robredo and her ilk dumb their campaign to the ground and make their followers even dumber on a couple of fronts. First is framing their entire campaign almost entirely within an opposition to some sort of “evil” Marcos-Duterte Axis that is a product of their shrill paranoia. Second is a dependence on PR and marketing trickery — a sissy colour, hollow slogans like “Mga Gwapo for Leni”, more generally, the template “[Insert subculture group here] for Leni”, and dishonest stunts like motorcades and TikTok videos.
Democracy is premised on the notion that there is “wisdom” in crowds. The way that Filipino politicians have been conducting themselves in national elections since 1986 aims to appeal to the electorate’s lowest common denominator — entertainment and bloodlust. Crowd wisdom is not what is being tapped here, only impulsive and reckless mob behaviour. The camp of “vice president” Leni Robredo leads the way in turning Philippine elections into a circus. Not that any Philippine election had ever been anything but a circus, but one would expect these self-appointed “champions of democratic freedom” to be leading the charge to step up to the formidable challenge of getting modern rationality to win over reptilian thinking. Instead, Robredo’s camp play into that easy space where tribalism and us-versus-them exclusivity trump all else.
Surely there is a way forward and a pathway to lifting the Philippines from the crass bottom-feeding that characterises her politics today. The Yellowtards led by Leni Robredo are certainly not setting that course seeing the sort of campaign she is subjecting Filipino voters to. Instead of encouraging thoughtful consideration, they appeal to backward sensibilities that former colonial masters and present-day oligarchs have long exploited to keep the natives lapping up the proverbial Kool-Aid.",Politics
Memo to Robredo “pinklawans” and broader Yellowtard and commie camps: Marcos-vs-Aquino narrative has gotten OLD,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/memo-to-robredo-pinklawans-and-broader-yellowtard-and-commie-camps-marcos-vs-aquino-narrative-has-gotten-old/,"Do you actually believe Inquirer columnist and former Undersecretary Manuel L. Quezon III (MLQ3) when he posits that the collective political psyche of the Filipino revolves around what he refers to as the Marcos-Aquino blood feud? In his Inquirer piece today “Marcos Jr. biding his time”, MLQ3 goes even further to assert that “it was always the Filipino People vs. the Marcoses after 1972” suggesting that in this imagined “battle” between “good” and “evil”, the “Filipino people” are on the side of the Aquinos.
First off, was it Ferdinand Marcos who started this feud or was it Ninoy Aquino? To the best of my knowledge, Marcos was never an enemy of the Aquinos, or the Cojuangcos for that matter. When Ninoy began his political career in the 50s, Marcos was already making a name for himself as Congressman. The feud only began when Ninoy was elected Senator. Perhaps it was the Lopezes who prodded him on after they sensed that Marcos wasn’t going fully honor the quid pro quo they had with Nanding Lopez as his Vice-President.
The administration coalition is in shambles because the power blocs may be wary of a Marcos presidency. President Rodrigo Duterte may have had other plans which is why he first floated the idea of a President Bong Go. When that didn’t fly, it became Vice-President Duterte. Inday Sara “Daughterte” was in the mix but no way would she be under the control of the Davao Origs under Salvador Medialdea and Go, which is why she categorically stated there will only be one Duterte who will run for national office and she didn’t want to have anything to do with PDP-Laban either. We are not privy to the actual goings-on in the corridors of power but we can only speculate. Based on the facts at hand now, the administration and opposition camps are in the same boat; with the administration having the advantage of the whole of government at its disposal, just like what the Aquino administration enjoyed in 2016. There was a modus vivendi between Daughterte and Marcos Jr; they won’t butt heads in the Presidential race. Marcos has declared his candidacy based on this.
From what we can see, the administration had run out of time before the October 8 deadline but there is still the November 15 one for substitution. The Opposition has shown their cards. It’s Robredo for them and has been all along despite her consternation, discernment, and all the accompanying drama that Robredo brings into what’s really a simple decision to make. The rumblings within the Opposition now is leverage being deployed by leftist-militants which is part and parcel of their process. In the meantime, there is the NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA coalition which has emerged as better organized, funded, and with a definitive strategy. Neither pro-Opposition nor pro-Administration but pro-Philippines.
MLQ3 is too preoccupied with the narrative that he and other Opposition stalwarts insist is the end all and be all of the 2022 election; stop Marcos and no Duterte as Vice-President. MLQ3 does not even bother to address the elephant in the room which is Mar Roxas casting his lot with Isko instead of Leni. This is why Lito Banayo and Serge Osmeña are running Isko’s campaign with funding being provided by known anti-Duterte oligarchs. Neither the administration nor the third party, which is NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA, are harping on “the Marcos issue”. Sen. Ping Lacson has categorically stated that the rule of law will prevail. His stand is the country is facing more serious problems than focusing again on the Marcos cases pending before the courts in relation to Marcos’ candidacy. Robredo’s supporters branded Lacson-Sotto as “Duterte enablers” but got the surprise of their lives when some of their Senatorial candidates were adopted by Robredo. Isn’t this an explicit admission that they can’t win on their own merits?
Frankly, the Marcos-Aquino narrative is getting old. Too old in fact. Yet MLQ3 and his ilk, Robredo included, refuse to stop beating on a dead horse. They don’t seem to realize that they’re driving voters away instead of gaining them for their cause. The bandwagon of support on social media isn’t exactly the same on the ground. Then what of the probability that Duterte is simply not interested anymore about who wins in 2022? The only other option he has is substitute for Go and run in tandem with Marcos which would be a game-changer.
In the meantime, the Liberal Party, Aksyon Demokratiko and the supposedly independent Robredo camps are busy sniping at each other. The Marcos and Lacson campaign organizations are focusing on their preparations and minding their own business. It would appear that they are practicing Napoleon’s dictum of keeping quiet while the enemies are making mistakes.",Politics
Robredo enjoys I-Told-You-So moment as Bongbong Marcos notches a SOLID 49.3 percent preference rating in latest poll!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/robredo-enjoys-i-told-you-so-moment-as-bongbong-marcos-notches-a-solid-49-3-percent-preference-rating-in-latest-poll/,"The latest Publicus Asia survey report Pahayag Q3 2021 is out and the results are sure to make the Opposition cry a river. Cutting to the presidential race, former Senator Bongbong Marcos tops the preference numbers at 49.3 percent with “vice president” Leni Robredo a far far second at 21.3 percent overall. Consistent with this, Robredo cops a whopping 40.4 percent disapproval rating, easily dwarfing the negative ratings of fellow top officials President Rodrigo Duterte and Senate President Tito Sotto who rated at 21.4 and 27.0 percent disapproval scores respectively. The only consolation here for Robredo is that she can enjoys a bit of an I-told-you-so moment as the broader Opposition, on edge, gingerly stares into the abyss of another potential catastrophic rout.
Robredo’s closest brush with Marcos’s numbers are, not surprisingly, in her Southern Luzon bailiwick albeit still short by almost seven percentage points of the latter’s 38.2 percent preference rating there. Only six of Robredo’s eleven-member senatorial slate made the Top 15 preferred senatorial candidates: Chel Diokno, Chiz Escudero, Dick Gordon, Risa Hontiveros, Joel Villanueva, and Migz Zubiri. Liberal Party stalwarts Teddy Baguilat and Leila De Lima trailed far behind below the 21-rank mark together with Magdalo candidate Antonio Trillanes. It is, indeed, looking bad for what is left of the Liberal Party of Yellowtard yore with Robredo’s running mate, vice presidential candidate, languishing at fifth ranking (below the “Undecided” respondents) attracting just 12.3 percent of respondents’ vote.
The results of the Emotional Quotient ratings of top leaders Duterte, Robredo, and Sotto is also an indictment of the Philippines dominant religious establishment. Duterte, whose trust score dwarfs that of the other two has “religious” at the bottom of traits most admired about him by respondents. Robredo and Sotto, on the other hand, had “religious” rating at the top of their most admired trait list. This is a clear message to the country’s once-formidable kingmaker, the Roman Catholic Church and its henchmen in the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) to butt the hell out of electoral politics. Filipinos do not care about religiousness in their leaders. The Church’s blessing evidently contributes a Reverse Midas Touch to politicians today. Duterte’s public perception of being “Brave” and “Decisive” is the same, with both traits at the bottom of Robredo’s and Sotto’s list of perceived personal attributes. For Robredo, the message is clear: fire your campaign strategists. Clearly, Filipinos want a real leader they can follow to battle — not some lame mother figure, and certainly not a candidate campaigning using the colour pink.
The thumbs down on the Opposition camp’s leading Yellowtard bloc extends to its top media mouthpiece “social news network” Rappler which ranked a dismal 13th in a list of 18 news outlets respondents were asked to rate for trustworthiness. Rappler, whose CEO Maria Ressa is this year’s Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate, did manage to beat news sites Eagle News, Summit Express, Abante, SMNI, and Politiko Online. One wonders then on what basis Ressa “won” her “Peace Prize” considering all the money she sucked up trotting the globe in order to schmooze with a who’s-who of Western mainstream media honchos. Indeed, it therefore becomes even more imperative that veteran journalists not take the Nobel committee’s insult to their professional community sitting down seeing that the organisation she leads finds itself in the company of the least trusted of the lot.
The Opposition is toast. At this stage, they will have been facing a Second Marcos Presidency in the face if the elections were held today. Either way, they will spend the rest of the campaign in the lead up to May 2022 shaking their heads unable to shake the thought that if they had only “united” under one “leader”, they could stand a chance of winning by a one percent margin over Marcos. Consider too that there is little hope of changing Marcos’s ratings. After all, whatever the Yellowtards and communists had thrown at him over the last thirty years did not prevent him getting to where he is today both position-wise and numbers-wise. What makes the Pinkies and the Commies think slinging the same mud at Bongbong Marcos over the next six months will yield different results for their political fortunes?

One such parrot is PhilSTAR lifestyle columnist Joel Pablo Salud who, in a Facebook post, wrote about, you guessed it, “ongoing repression of press freedom in the Philippines” that national artist F. Sionil Jose recently “conveniently dismissed”. He also takes issue with the idea that criticism Ressa has been receiving “goes with the territory” of being a Nobel laureate…
Many Nobel winners received flak for being chosen, they said. My answer: The question of whether Ressa was deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize or not is worlds apart from the criticism leveled on Pearl S. Buck and others.
How is the situation different from the past? Journalists killed in the practice of their profession are usually in the provinces when they run afoul of local political kingpins. Those who belong to leftist-militant media organizations such as Bulatlat, Kodao, and Altermidya are included in the order of battle of the state because they incite sedition. The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) is an organization that is critical of administrations which don’t hew to their ideological line. The image created is there is suppression of freedom of the press in the country when, in truth, there is none. All publications are free to print what they please. What is different with President Rodrigo Duterte is that he directly engages his detractors who have crossed the line as in the case of Rappler and then Manila Standard columnist Kit Tatad.
American media is no different from the Philippines. During Donald Trump’s Presidency, he was covered by the press with a microscope which isn’t the case with current President Joe Biden now. During the administration of former President Noynoy Aquino, the press had no choice but to go after the news because they couldn’t afford to ignore it due to the scale of Aquino’s blunders. These journalist-activists pursue their agenda against the state as part of a concerted effort to discredit the present administration and get public opinion to the side of the Opposition. The problem is the public sees through them already. Their blinders have come off. This is why the truth and principles in the practice of journalism in the country have been done away with. That is not important anymore. What matters is the defeat of illiberalism as symbolized by Duterte and labeled by them as Dutertismo.
What is more serious here is the breakdown in the social mores that govern civil behavior. Civility has gone out the window. It appears that the primary consideration now is which side of the journalists bread is buttered and by whom. One cannot deny that Ressa’s backers have a sinister agenda and that she is a pawn in the events that are unfolding. The same method was employed in the past in the then opposition’s struggle against former President Ferdinand Marcos. But we should ask ourselves the question, why is it that the Opposition continues to use the Marcoses as an issue? They had all of thirty years to prove all their allegations and do better as what they promised in the snap election campaign. The Opposition had been engaged in a gaslighting campaign against the public. They have gone to the extent of describing the country as a “battered woman” under Duterte.
The 2022 election will decide with finality whose opinion reflects the public’s. Should Marcos win it would be vindication for him. But the odds are stacked against Marcos because everyone knows that the opposition will do everything in its power to prevent him from winning if he is indeed the people’s choice. Perhaps this is what the senior statesman, Juan Ponce Enrile warned about last week. The lengths to which the opposition would go to prevent a Marcos win at the polls would exact a heavy toll if they push for a confrontation.
I hope my friends are aware that there are vested interests ready to fan the fire to gain tremendous advantage and benefit from an escalation of the discord. It seems to me that the national political situation in the country is nearly like to what happened before President Marcos declared Martial Law 49 years ago in 1972. I hope you, my friends, use your brilliant minds  to analyze the political situation and avoid the eruption  of an unintended and unwanted civil strife in the land.
In effect, what Enrile is saying is once the genie is out of the bottle, you can’t put him back in. Remember that a divided nation bolsters the Opposition’s chances of winning. But what if the people are decided that they are done with the Opposition and tired of disunity? The stakes are high in this election cycle not only because we need a capable leader to guide the country through the pandemic but also the time to make a decision about the unanswered question of the “Edsa Revolution” has come to pass.",Politics
Shallow and incestuous party benches mirror acute dearth of talent and qualification in Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/shallow-and-incestuous-party-benches-mirror-acute-dearth-of-talent-and-qualification-in-philippine-politics/,"Inquirer columnist Doy Romero in his piece today “The Generic 5” frames the state of play today as “matrix politics” where “political parties now appear like administrative stables under an administrative head, from which are drawn players to form ad hoc project teams headed by a project manager.” In reality, this situation is symptomatic of the ever shallower talent pool caused by the defects in the 1987 Constitution. Why? The enabling law on political dynasties was never passed by Congress due to its vested interests and so the public is now stuck with what is deemed to be “the best of the best” of recycled candidates who take a break after term limits are reached then make a comeback.
The last batch of promising politicos was the “Spice Boys” in Congress. None of them were able to win higher office. Not even Chiz Escudero came close. He was deemed a Presidentiable in the 2010 election cycle but wasn’t selected by the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) as he got on the bad side of Boss Danding Cojuangco because of his monetary demands. So now we have this phenomenon of what Romero refers to as “matrix politics” but what is actually a confirmation of the incestuous nature of our political structure. What no one talks about is how it is possible for a Presidential candidate to win without a slate or a party organization. Rodrigo Duterte did it in 2016. It was only two weeks before the election when the national and regional parties consolidated with him because of his impending victory. Then again, there isn’t a candidate in this election cycle who possesses Duterte’s political character.
Isko Moreno is trying very hard but failing. Given his fiasco of a sortie yesterday in Tarlac, it’s not likely he will make it in the same manner as Duterte did. One wonders why despite having Lito Banayo and Serge Osmena as his political strategists, Isko’s framing and messaging are off. It may well be he is unable to grasp the context in his head. This is the national political derby not the local. Leni Robredo is the same. During her foray into the Rotary Club of Manila meeting, she flubbed easy questions which she should’ve been able to answer given she’s been Vice-President for five years. Apparently, MaDumb is living up to her sobriquet. Her statements are like a narcissist’s word salad. Neither here, nor there, but everywhere, which leaves you clueless and reaching for a banig of medicol. It doesn’t look like we will see much of an improvement over Leni 1.0 in the 2.0 version we are seeing in this election cycle.
The time is really ripe for the public to be educated about charter change. It can’t be that these politicians are the best of the best of what the younger generation has to offer in a nation of 106 million people. I’m waiting for the candidate’s official platforms to see who will include this in his agenda. I omit her because Leni definitely will not tamper with the sacred document that is the 1987 Constitution, which is the bible of the Yellowidiot cult. This, despite the many times they have circumvented its provisions about succession, whenever it has been convenient to their good versus evil narrative.",Politics
Parties and politicians opposed to the Anti-Terror Bill put partisan agendas first before Filipinos’ safety and security,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/parties-and-politicians-opposed-to-the-anti-terror-bill-put-partisan-agendas-first-before-filipinos-safety-and-security/,"One of the issues being raised by the Opposition in the coming 2022 election is the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which is an updated version of the Human Security Act of 2007. It has come under scrutiny because its main sponsors are Senate President Tito Sotto and Sen. Ping Lacson, who are running as a ticket for President and Vice-President under the NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA coalition. Lacson and Sotto have been tagged as “Duterte-enablers” by the Opposition as a result. Never mind that the two have been vocal in their description of their tandem as neither pro-Opposition or pro-Administration, but pro-Philippines. The bill passed the Senate last February 26, 2020, with Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Pia Cayetano, Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Grace Poe, Imee Marcos, Manuel “Lito” Lapid, Joel Villanueva, Cynthia Villar, Emmanuel “Manny” Pacquiao, Win Gatchalian, Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, Richard Gordon, Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, Bong Revilla, Francis “Tol” Tolentino, Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, Majority Leader Migz Zubiri and Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III voting in the affirmative while Senators Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan and Risa Hontiveros dissented.
The Opposition would like to make the law an election issue because they claim that its provisions violate the human rights of an individual who is identified as a person of interest. What are objectionable to the Opposition and its allies are the provisions which severely curtail the ability of suspected terrorists and terrorist networks to operate once preliminarily identified by the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), which is tasked with implementing the Anti-Terror Law and the authority of the ATC to order a freeze on their bank account and request for wiretaps from the judiciary. The members of the ATC are the Executive Secretary, who is the Chairman, the National Security Adviser as the Vice-Chairman, the Secretary’s of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Interior and Local Government, Finance, Information and Communications Technology, Justice and the Executive Director of the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat.
“We think this is against the constitution,” said human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno. “Given the broader definition of terrorism, the administration’s critics could be tagged as suspected terrorists.” Opposition Congressman Edcel Lagman said Duterte was “tightening the noose on suspected terrorists at the expense of the protection of human rights and civil liberties.” In the meantime, Senate Minority Floor Leader Franklin Drilon of the Liberal Party said “I signed it on the basis of my best judgment that strikes a balance between protecting our people against abuses by the state and protecting the state itself. All I can say is I tried my best. I can face anyone and say I am not favoring anyone.It was in my desire to have a balance between the desire to prevent terrorism and balance it with the rights of the people. I have done my best.”
At present, there are thirty-seven (37) pending petitions at the Supreme Court questioning the Constitutionality of its provisions. The 37 petitioners, clustered into six groups for the purpose of final position papers, have all submitted their memoranda to the High Court on June 25. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has also submitted its 800-page memorandum in defense of the law, which means the countdown has started in the Supreme Court. “By the sheer number of petitions it might take some time before the Court can at least prepare its draft, but hopefully within the year perhaps we can have a decision on [those] 37 petitions before the year ends,” said Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo in a chance interview last July 8.
Sen. Ping Lacson was initially included in the list of Presidential candidates that convenor group 1Sambayan was considering in an effort to come up with one candidate to represent the opposition against the administration in the May 2022 polls. Lacson removed himself from consideration by way of a formal letter to former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, the lead convenor. Lacson said that after seeing Carpio’s television interview, “I have been under the impression that 1Sambayan colation has effectively precluded a possible association with this representation, since you made it clear, as its lead convenor, that it would be ‘inconsistent’ and ‘incongruous’ for the group to endorse, let alone, be identified with somebody who is one of the authors and the principal sponsor” of the Anti-Terrorism Law. While you have explicitly and repeatedly made a remark during the interview that you have ‘no problem’ with me running again as a senator in the upcoming national elections, I could not possibly reconcile how much would be the case if it has been publicly disclosed by the former Associate Justice that his misgivings are anchored on this representation’s stand in earnestly sponsoring a measure in the exercise of my sworn duty as one of the elected lawmakers of the land,” Lacson added.
Subsequent events have led to the present imbroglio between the Lacson-Sotto camp and that of the Opposition as the two went ahead with their formal declaration that they were running for President and Vice-President after talks with Vice-President Leni Robredo failed. The impression given the public was Lacson initiated the talks but Sotto later clarified that it was the Vice-President’s Chief of Staff who sent a text message to his counterpart in Sotto’s office to arrange the meeting. Sen. Lacson later disclosed that the Vice-President rejected his proposal outright at the onset without even taking the time to give it serious consideration.
The Anti-Terror Bill has become more essential in light of the Taliban regaining control of Afghanistan after the US’s hasty pullout. Terrorist groups again have access to a safe haven from which they could operate from and plan attacks in the future. The problem with the Opposition is they refuse to look at the law from the point of view of national security, giving preference over the issue of civil liberties. It has been made worse by their supporters labeling the Lacson-Sotto tandem as “Duterte-enablers” even if the the sponsorship of the law was made clearly in the interest of protecting the Republic and its citizens from threat of terrorism, domestic or otherwise.
National security is also an election issue seeing as how we are caught in the middle of the rivalry between the US and China in the region. The Anti-Terror Bill is an update over the Human Security Act of 2007. It is clear that it is not meant to strike down civil liberties but to prevent acts of terrorism and even organized crime syndicates from endangering the citizens of the Republic.
As Sen. Lacson said, “we are neither pro-Administration or pro-Opposition. We are pro-Philippines.” Lacson added that he and Sotto would stick to the conduct of an issues-based campaign instead of the usual mudslinging and black propaganda saying that the Filipino people deserve nothing less during this crucial juncture of our nation’s history. The challenges the country faces needs a serious, credible and responsible leader.",Politics
Only charter change following the 2022 elections will see the last of plurality presidents and a more unified Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/only-charter-change-following-the-2022-elections-will-see-the-last-of-plurality-presidents-and-a-more-unified-philippines/,"Why are Filipinos so disunited thirty-five years after Ferdinand Marcos was ousted? The answer lies in part to the unanswered question of who actually won the 1986 Snap Election. Marcos claimed victory. When the RAM mounted a coup and failed at the onset, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile verified the claim of the then opposition that Marcos cheated. That became the basis for the assumption of Cory Aquino to the Presidency.
Between 1986 and 2016, there were two hotly-contested elections; 1992 and 2004. Poll data shows that the Marcos camp could’ve won the 1992 election if only Imelda Marcos hadn’t run. Danding Cojuangco would win by a plurality over Fidel Ramos and Miriam Santiago. Yet Cojuangco lost in large part due to the efforts of Ramos who sent Roquito Ablan to meet with Imelda and convince her to run against Danding with whom she had a rift with.
This was repeated in 2004 again because of Joseph Estrada’s ouster by a civil-military coup in 2001. The Yellows mustered enough protests to bring down Estrada from power over perceived corruption. He was the first President impeached and tried by the Senate. The House prosecutors walked out of the trial in protest over a key ruling they lost the vote on because Estrada had the numbers. It was a foregone conclusion that he would be acquitted and the then opposition would have none of this outcome. They took to the streets for EDSA 2. Mob rule triumphed over the rule of law again. Erap’s proxy, Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ), lost the 2004 election where it was revealed that then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was caught on tape speaking with election operator and Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Director Virgilio Garcillano. The Hello Garci scandal wasn’t enough to oust GMA but it did earn her the distinction of the most unpopular post-Marcos President.
Today, the rift is between those who favor the strongman Presidential style of Rodrigo Duterte over the leftist-militant-liberal ideology of today’s Opposition. The 1987 Constitution’s inherent defect allows the election of a plurality President where the losers will always say that the winner didn’t obtain a clear majority. The Yellows and Reds are basically sore losers. When the anti-Yellow politicians lost the election in 2010 with the victory of Noynoy Aquino, they cooperated with his administration. It was Aquino who pursued his personal vendetta against his political enemies by having them charged and detained on plunder raps.
The 2022 election has five declared candidates for President. This ensures another plurality President unless one of them actually garners enough votes for a majority win. This is also dependent on what the voters’ sentiments actually are; strongman rule or one that goes back to the ideology of the opposition.
The Yellows and the Reds are the cause of this political dysfunction because of their continuing refusal to entertain the idea of changing the form of government. All of this can be avoided by putting in place a run-off provision or a wholesale change to a federal parliamentary system which would allow for autonomous regions to spur development. Duterte did not act on this particular campaign promise of his but there were several attempts on the part of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to test the waters including the formation of an inter-agency task force.
It doesn’t help that it appears that the major power blocs supporting Duterte have gone on their own for the 2022 election cycle. Both the administration and opposition camps are in disarray with the latter having it worse because there are the camps of Vice President Leni Robredo and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso competing for votes. It remains to be seen how the candidacy of Manny Pacquiao will pan out as he has the weakest campaign organization among the three.
I really hope that charter change will be on the agenda of either the administration bet or that of the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto ticket if only to serve as the solution for the achievement of national unity. The Philippines’ political divisiveness has exacted a heavy toll on the country’s development because the lack of continuity has made the Philippines unattractive to foreign direct investment. The county badly needs foreign direct investments (FDIs) if it’s to bring down its level of borrowing to make up for the revenue shortfall brought about by the disruption caused by the pandemic. There is also the urgent need to amend the Constitutional provisions limiting foreign ownership of corporations and land.",Politics
The Rise of the Tulfo Political Dynasty,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/the-rise-of-the-tulfo-political-dynasty/,"From media powerhouse, the Tulfos may emerge as a political powerhouse straddling both houses of congress.
Raffy Tulfo of the Raffy Tulfo In Action fame is mounting a campaign for a seat in the senate. Sister Wanda Tulfo Teo, former tourism secretary, is running under the Turismo partylist. Jocelyn, the wife of Raffy, and Erwin Tulfo are also running under ACT-CIS partylist.
Our COMELEC sources says that left on the wayside of the secret shuffle within the ACT-CIS partylist is congresswoman Nina Taduran. A simple Google search reveals that in the Congresswoman’s records from the House of Representatives website, Taduran had dutifully served the ACT CIS with the filing of 125 principally authored bills, 49 co-authored bills, and served in 5 house committees.
See, that’s the thing with dynasties, it puts blood ties above actual merit and eventually crumbles after being starved of actual talent.
As it happens, our COMELEC sources say that Taduran’s name was unceremoniously left out of the list of nominees submitted by the ACT-CIS partylist to COMELEC.
Taduran would have given way to Erwin, had she been asked – after all, she honors a debt of gratitude towards the Tulfos. But in this instance, there was not even an inkling that she was excluded from the nominees.
Word from our high roller Sabong aficionado sources say that Erwin is flush with funds from business partner, online sabong king Charlie Atong Ang. Just how flush? Well, sources say that he recently bought a P200 million mansion in Greenhills, San Juan. He also recently acquired a yacht, a chopper, and several 7-11 stores.
We will know if word of this sudden wealth is true, if and when Erwin includes these items in his SALN if ACT CIS wins enough votes for a seat in the next congress.
One thing that concerns us though, is how many candidates are being funded by gambling, legal and otherwise?
For months now, we have been writing about a certain Rose Nono Lin of the Pharmally fame and her bid for the congressional seat of Quezon City’s 5th District. In the Senate Blue ribbon inquiry, she admitted to operating several POGO o Philippine Overseas Gaming Operation firms. POGOs, in previous senate inquiries, have been revealed to be surrounded by criminal activities of the usual variety and also of high volume money laundering.",Politics
"Platforms and action plans, NOT mere motherhood statements: Filipinos should expect MORE from their candidates",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/platforms-and-action-plans-not-mere-motherhood-statements-filipinos-should-expect-more-from-their-candidates/,"Mass media was existent even before the rise of President Rodrigo Duterte. But the clowns in public office were the offshoots of the dumbing down of the Filipino by ABS-CBN and the change in demographics brought about by uncontrolled population growth. Professor Randy David in his Inquirer piece “Politics in the age of mass media” rightly observed how politicians nowadays “spend a lot of time and resources creating personal ‘narratives’ that might appeal to a fickle voting public.” David points his finger at today’s “era of the mass media” where…
The old values of statesmanship have been replaced by the ever-shifting topics of public opinion. Today, what animates public opinion has become more difficult to pin down. We see only whom it favors, but we are left guessing what moves it at any given time.
David doesn’t name names because the Opposition would be front and center in the creation of narratives which all began with Cory Aquino, the “simple housewife who toppled Marcos”. The image of her husband Ninoy Aquino was rehabilitated from typical regional warlord to one of a Christian social democrat.
Politics in the Philippines has never been based on ideology. The Nacionalistas rose to power as advocates of self-rule during the American period. Right after the war, the priorities of America in the region changed with the geopolitical landscape. Its focus was on Japan and preventing the spread of communism. The Philippines was granted independence and Manuel Roxas became General Douglas MacArthur’s fair-haired boy. Thus was born the Liberal Party.
From 1946 to 1969, politicians went from one to another in what could be best described as revolving door politics. It became the tradition with every election cycle similar to what migratory birds do with the changing of the season. Ferdinand Marcos’s cure for this was the parliamentary form of government. The result was the monolith that was the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party. There were few opposition parties in the Batasang Pambansa (national legislature) then but you could see the system working because of the emergence of the Pusyon Bisaya and the Mindanao Alliance. Without this system, we wouldn’t have seen the likes of Hilario Davide, Nene Pimentel, Bono Adaza and Reuben Canoy rise to national prominence.
If Cory hadn’t done away with the entire 1973 Constitution then we probably wouldn’t find ourselves in this quagmire of mediocrity now. But the system’s rot is beginning to show. We have recycled Senators and newbies who aren’t exactly qualified at the bare minimum. Willie Revillame at least used his head and decided not to run. But topping the surveys for this election cycle is Raffy Tulfo whose platform is to give justice to the oppressed. That’s not what we need from legislators in the time of the pandemic. This is not much different from what the Opposition’s platform is.
I don’t think they even bother to read about what has taken place in the short span of time the pandemic has caused global disruption. I glanced at an interview of Gibo Teodoro by that Pinoy expat in the Netherlands, Sass Rogando Sasot, who may be credentialed but by no means nuanced in statecraft. At least Gibo has something to offer by way of what he’s seen in the private sector with respect to digitization. However, we need more than this to cope with the pandemic-is-endemic approach which needs the whole-of-government to get behind it in conjunction with the private sector.
The present situation requires prioritisation of initiatives and programs focused on food and energy security as well as public health. We need foreign direct investments to set the economy on the path to recovery because we can’t borrow our way to it. Governments are sitting on a massive pile of debt and it will continue to grow as other countries are also spending their way out of the pandemic-induced recession. The positive sign is the public going out of their way to participate in the 2022 polls. Not even the pandemic can prevent people from registering as voters. This is why it is imperative that this election be issues-based and not the usual personality-based politics we have come to expect from candidates. From the national down to the local level, it should be about platforms of governance. An action plan not motherhood statements.
The Opposition would rather make the election about personalities; Marcos, Duterte and the usual narrative of authoritarianism, populism and damaged institutions. This is the liberals and the leftists making a mountain out of a molehill of irrelevant issues. We should hold the Opposition to a higher standard because their track record from 1986-2016 leaves much to be desired. There are still a lot of reforms needed to make government more responsive and minimize what is lost to corruption. It is not only about political personalities but government as well.
Hopefully the greater majority of Filipinos realize this. Maybe they already have if we go by their efforts to make their voice heard through the ballot come May 2022. The onus is really on the Filipino to make the decision.",Politics
Is “voting wisely” even an option?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/is-voting-wisely-even-an-option/,"The Philippine General Elections for 2022 had already began when the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) welcomed various political candidates from all walks of life as they applied for certain national or local positions. Some were old, some were young, some were familiar, some were unknown, and some were something in between those lines. However, since the Philippines only gets to choose the country’s chief executive once every six years as mentioned by the Constitution, all eyes were on the presidential hopefuls.
Electing a Philippine president would always have its own cultural and historical value that mirrors the peculiarities of our archipelagic nation. Way before smartphones and telecom groups like Samsung, Apple, and Huawei were raking in financial benefits brought by 3G technology, Philippine politics had already been marred by its own version of 3G: Guns, Goons, and Gold. Assassination, intimidation, and bribery were the names of the game when you play politics and vie for public office in the Philippines. To a certain extent, these three demeaning acts are still being done to political opponents, supporters, and voters, but it has continuously evolved as Internet usage permeated the lives of ordinary Filipinos. These technologies might have mitigated such dangers especially to human life, but it can nevertheless be disheartening and intoxicating.
Even though the Information Age transformed how elections and politics are played, it doesn’t change the notion that the Philippine electoral system is bound to degrade with time, where there is premeditated degeneration brought by the frailties and flaws of the 1987 Constitution. Taking a look at how a presidential candidate takes Malacanang Palace in an electoral process, a presidentiable only needs to have a numerical advantage over his or her fellow presidentiables. Basically, the candidate who gets the biggest number wins, whether he or she won it through a majority vote or as a plurality vote. As such, it can be safely said that the most popular candidate would emerge victorious. Looking at the Philippines that is very attached to popularity and creating impressions, we have romanticized elections where these individuals would entertain their supporters and woo possible voters in numerous creative ways, which would include singing, dancing, and displaying acts of charity where political campaigns are becoming like noon-time, variety, Philippine TV shows.
A number of individuals would say that the best way to counter this degeneration of Philippine elections is to “vote wisely”, where a voter would meticulously check a candidate’s background, character, and political platform. Others would say that one can counteract this degeneration by “voting according to one’s conscience”, where practicing the right to suffrage entails discerning what is wrong from what is right. However, let’s be practical here since the ideal is far from what is real. If everyone is going to vote wisely and vote accordingly to one’s conscience, we’d end up compelling ourselves to look for saints in the company of sinners. The conclusion is that, we’ll just keep on chasing pavements over and over again.
To learn how elections ought to be, observing the third and the fourth largest economies of the world might provide us with good insights, specially considering that they are holding or have held their general elections this year. Japan would hold their general elections in a few weeks where the current administration of LDP and Komeito are expected to retain a majority of their seats, while Germany has just recently concluded theirs, where the centrist-left party SPD won the largest number of seats in the Bundestag, followed by the centrist-right party CDU-CSU. These two countries are known liberal democracies, where they elect representatives to the parliament, who in turn help in determining who would be the country’s head of government.
It is interesting to notice that when they hold elections for their respective parliaments for the lower house, there are only two parts where Japanese and German voters practice their right in the ballot. First, they choose who their representative would be in their respective congressional district, and then they choose what political party they are going to cast a vote for, where parliamentary seats are awarded to the political parties in accordance to the percentage of votes they have garnered. These are tallied and, later, these political parties would get to know who gets to form the government.
Both cases show a significant degree of simplicity for the voters, which is in contrast to the Philippine electoral system, where we choose a president, a vice president, 12 senators, a party-list, a governor, a vice governor, a congressional representative, a number of board members, a mayor, a vice mayor, and a number of councilors. Depending on one’s domicile, some positions might be written on the ballot, while others would be absent (for example, Metro Manila voters have no need to elect a governor, a vice governor, and board members). Nevertheless, it is evident that choosing candidates during general elections in the Philippines is both a daunting and a stressful task. I am even unsure if every voter is provided with the best resources in applying these “vote wisely” and “vote according to conscience” notions that a number of individuals are perennially calling for. We cannot hold ourselves and fellowmen accountable as voters when the electoral system itself calls for the complicated game to be played blatantly with underhanded tactics.
If we want to embrace voter accountability, adopting parts of the Japanese and German elections might help. A voter-friendly ballot would allow the voter to look for issues that would serve his or her interests the most, instead of just relying on name recall. A clear example is when the German Green Party gained a significant amount of seats in the Bundestag as more Germans are more conscientious regarding climate change issues. A voter-friendly ballot would also better reflect the conditions and the needs of the electorate. In an instance where one citizen dislikes his/her representative’s performance, the voter might as well choose a different candidate as a sign of protest and discontent. If it is the other way around, this citizen can ought to elect the incumbent as a symbol of support and continuity.
It might sound radical, but I am in favor of greatly simplifying elections in the Philippines. Creating an electoral system where voters would only choose one representative in Congress for the national government and another member of the board or councilor in their respective local government unit would sound extreme, but this would remove numerous social diseases associated with our elections. These congressional representatives would convene and choose who will be the head of the government, while these board members or councilors do the same in their own localities. Of course, there are nitty-gritty parts that need to be addressed, but it doesn’t change the fact that such reformation and restructuring of the system is a must if we are to uplift the lives of marginalized Filipinos. After all, everyone becomes only a number come election time. Election in a democracy is an equalizer, and it is meant to be one.",Politics
Iron fists and visionary leadership will continue to sell well in Philippine elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/iron-fists-and-visionary-leadership-will-continue-to-sell-well-in-philippine-elections/,"Gone are the days when voters lapped up motherhood statements and ayuda or suntok sa buwan promises to sooth their longing for a respite from the painful reality of living in the Philippines. The landslide victory of Duterte in 2016 was a resounding stamp of approval by the general populace for a change from the way liberal freedom-addicted politicians have been managing the country.
Filipinos now want a strong-handed enforcer to straighten up the system and bring people in line. We saw how lame-duck presidencies led the country down the road of chaos and suffering: like the mess that ensued during Cory’s coup d’etat riddled stint in Malacanang coupled with our literally entering the dark ages (those debilitating power outages), and the shame that came with PNoy taking on the title of worst president the Philippines ever had (with his long infamous list of goof-ups starting from the Luneta hostage crisis down to the SAF44 massacre).
Majority of Filipinos want the same Duterte-type brand of rule in the country this coming 2022, no matter how much the West and the Nobel Peace Prize committee want to portray any tinge of authoritarianism in the country as “evil”. The fathers of past generations have led their families as “authoritarians”. What they said became the rule of law, and that ensured order, stability, unity, and progress in the home.
In fact most functional institutions and organizations are dictatorial by nature. Take a basketball team for example: you cannot question the coach if he decided to use a certain play as a last-2-minute strategy. In a given company like Toyota or Sony, workers are not asked if they prefer Marketing VP Mr. Nakamura to take the reins of the company instead Design Chief Mr. Marumi.
Now let’s take a look at the iron-fisted contenders for this coming 2022 presidential elections:
But beyond the iron fists and strong leadership qualities that each can bring, the additional quality that Duterte brought to the table was his visionary leadership: he sold Filipinos his dream of the country’s youth free from drugs and a new political system based on Federalism. We should elect our next leader not just for being tough and strong but also for his forward-looking agenda. Ask yourself if who you plan to vote for has a plan. Does he have a destination for the country? Does he have a clear strategy for getting us from point A to B?
We are a unique democracy because everyone wants a hand in choosing the best authoritarian-leaning leader who can get us to our destination, and in the most efficient way. Many Filipinos believe a tinge of strict autocratic rule is good for the nation’s soul. Many think that what will work best for us now as a laggard in Asia is a benevolent dictator – someone who calls the shot like a big boss, rather than a weakling pulled by the strings of a puppeteer.
Let us believe in our vision for a Singapore-class C.O.D. (clean, orderly, disciplined) Philippines. Our experiment with too much freedom has left us in the dust amidst our high-flying East Asian neighbors. Let’s choose the man who has the best plan and has the strongest pollical will for getting us there. But if you don’t have a clear concept of our country’s 10-year or 50-year goals, how can we identify the man who best fits the bill in leading us? If we just want an “anything goes” country, then it won’t really matter who leads us as long as we are entertained. As the saying by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) goes…
If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.",Politics
Marcos Derangement Syndrome Overdrive,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/marcos-derangement-syndrome-overdrive/,"So it is presidential elections season again in the Philippines and cultish partisan bashing has started to get heated up once more. We know that exciting things are ahead as the country seems to be in a bar fight populated by a bunch of drunken basketball fans watching the Philippine team Gilas duking it out against Australia’s Boomers in a FIBA World Cup Qualifier. So why are a bunch of loons who, in all likelihood, are not even personally acquainted with the candidates, even fighting? This is exactly what identity politics give! It gives emotionally charged and bitter sentiments propelled by anger and retribution.
Perhaps one of the biggest culprits out there that stirs the pot of boiling hatred is the jaundiced news site Rappler. Now that the son of whom the Yellows consider to be the Pinoy version of Hitler, is leading in the polls, Rappler seems to be going on overdrive in discrediting anything and everything positive being attributed to Bongbong Marcos (BBM). Take for instance, the Bangui Windmills in Ilocos Norte, in which the establishment BBM has been praised for, is now being “cancelled” as a BBM project. Rappler contends that:
Hey, if it is from the organization of her yellow Holiness herself, Nobel Laureate Ma. Ressa, then it must be true! Afterall, Rappler is the bastion of integrity and truth, right? This is what the decent and the inteligencia of Philippine society affirms! Questioning that would make you a purveyor of fake news and a dreg of society. Subscribing to something outside of the yellow groupthink would make one a pariah. Eeewww! Gross! Definitely not worthy to even kiss the ground Megastar Sharon Cuneta’s Figlia shoes touches.
Anyway, what is interesting is that looking at the history of the Bangui Windmills, a Philstar article back in 2005 tells that work on the project started after a Danish engineer, who headed the project, met with then Ilocos Norte Governor BBM. The article states that:
“Jacobsen started work on the 24.75-megawatt project in 1999 after meeting Ilocos Norte Gov. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who was intent on fixing the patchy and low-voltage power supply to his region which lies on the northern tip of the country’s electricity grid.
Marcos was well aware of the potential of wind because his father and former president, Ferdinand Marcos, ordered a study into alternative energy in the 1970s amid the first global oil crisis.”
Okay so maybe technically speaking, Rappler is correct. In all likelihood, BBM’s name will not appear as one of the authors of the 1996 NREL study by the Americans. BBM was not identified as the project head in NorthWind Power Development Corporation’s study plan! Never mind that BBM was already intent on looking for ways to resolve the energy cost problem in Ilocos Norte (and never mind that alternative energy explorations were also one of his dad’s plans going back to the 70s), the fact is BBM’s name is not identified as an author of the 1996 NREL study nor as project head in the NorthWind Power Development Corporation’s study plan. So it is like this – a research study is conducted by lab ABC to see whether test article X has any use or is effective in addressing problem Y (which BBM is trying to look for answers to). The lab comes out with a study report (complete with the scientists’ or engineers’ names as authors in the study report). BBM gets approached about this study and BBM finds the utility of test article X to address problem Y that his province is experiencing. BBM gives the go-ahead on the execution of the project in his province but no credit should be attributed to him. His role, simply, is ministerial – at least this is what Yellows seem to be trying to convey.
Heaven forbid giving credit to BBM’s involvement in the realization of the project! No! If his name is not identified as an author in the study or if he isn’t identified as the head of the project in the project plan, then BBM being credited for the Bangui Windfarm project is “fake news”. One thing I am just curious about is – I wonder what would have happened to the project proposal or project plan document if the then Ilocos Norte Governor’s thinking was:
“Magtatayo ka ng windmill, paano kung walang hangin?”
It seems that any positive achievements or even effort, once attached to an identity (in this case, a Marcos), would trigger a rabid response that would give the green light (a color which, incidentally, an opposition candidate for VP is suggested to be owned by) to keyboard warriors to start their hunt and destroy mode. The Marcos Derangement Syndrome is quite amusing! It seems to invoke so much hatred from a bunch angry jaundiced partisans that can be likened to a pack of hyenas with hemorrhoids! Of course, we also do have calm heads from the Yellow side appealing for decency and a respectful exchange of ideas – right after appearing to insinuate that the people on the opposing side are indecent. Some of these self-proclaimed “learned” and “decent” appear to even be using the victim card just right after discriminating against people who don’t share their political beliefs, supported by people who advocate for the “decent” act of spitting on the food of BBM supporters.
Aren’t the Yellows supposed to be the paragon of decency, in which tolerance is a virtue? It seems that the reality for these folks is that preaching about decency is nothing but a practice of mere virtue signaling. Shouldn’t the “Tolerrati” be confident in their beliefs and not be so insecure about opposing views? Shouldn’t they actually embrace opposing views if they are so decent and tolerant? Well, it appears that they are insecure, and it appears that until the elections are over, at least – they won’t be embracing opposing views any time soon. The virtuous inteligencia of Philippine society must be so irked with us mere mortals for being in a fancy restaurant and asking for ketchup instead of Grey Poupon.",Politics
2022 elections a chance for Filipinos to remove communist vermin from public office,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/2022-elections-a-chance-for-filipinos-to-remove-communist-vermin-from-public-office/,"Joel Pablo Salud is one of my “favorite” editors in-chief, the other being his mentor Inday Espina Varona. He is very proud of his lack of formal education, yet constantly on the prowl for validation with social media postings of his vast book collection. He asks in his latest PhilSTAR piece: What would you ask the Presidential candidates if given the chance?
Salud’s fantasized questions are as predictable as he is self-deluded.
Will those who enabled the Duterte regime to carry out this inhumanity be charged? What about paid trolls? Will they be held accountable for the widespread intimidation and harassment of those critical of this regime? Should a law be passed deeming troll farms illegal?
What about the bereaved families of EJK victims? Will compensation be granted? What of the thousands imprisoned without due process?
Never mind that there are surveys confirming the trust and approval ratings of the President. In his and his cohort’s minds, we are under the spell of Dutertismo, an environment of magical realism where we think all is well but is actually not. Duterte must’ve undergone tutelage from the barangs of Siquijor early on in his career as a public official which is why he’s never lost an election since he was appointed Vice-Mayor of Davao City in 1986.
Salud mentions a number of issues, all against Duterte, not necessarily for the candidates except for the Anti-Terrorism Law, of which Sen. Ping Lacson was the principal author of. But what is their beef with the Anti-Terror Law? It’s simply the power of the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) to arrest without a warrant and detain for 14 days, a suspect upon the approval of the members of the ATC. Mind you, all of the kindred spirits of the leftist-liberal-militants are spared from this proviso. It is nowhere even near as draconian as the British-authored Internal Security At, in force in Malaysia and Singapore.
This is the problem with leftist-liberal militants who demand much from the State but want as little intervention as possible. What is contradictory is their stand on the West Philippine Sea. They’re anti-China but their brethren in the Communist Party of the Philippines, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army, and its “legal” National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) have been for the Maoist version of communism since 1968. This was a radical shift from the Marxist-Leninist orientation of the original Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, under Luis Taruc and the Lava brothers.
Hypocrisy is another outstanding character trait of Salud and his ilk. They are against the drug war and accuse the State of masterminding extra-judicial killings (EJKs) but refuse to hold the NPA to account for the murder of civililans, soldiers, and policemen in the insurgency. They claim the country’s sovereignty has been subverted by China but gladly open the doors of the country for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate the officials cited in the case filed by the late Jude Sabio, former Sen. Antonio Trillanes and former Rep. Gary Alejano.
There is also the ongoing ideological clash between the Pinklawans and the Reds over the inclusion of progressives in the Pinko Senatorial slate and the fact that their hated trapos are guest candidates. They claim they participate in the mainstream to make the people aware of their plight and are fighting for the people and have their support but they haven’t won a direct election since they started participating in the same.
The most glaring contradiction is martial law human rights violations. Their revolution is morally justified in their opinion, which is why the State has no right to defend itself and the citizens from the insurgency which they have been conducting against the State and its citizens. This is why there is the Bantayog ng mga Bayani which serves as their memorial for the “victims” of martial law.
The 2022 election is the chance of the people to vote these morons out of office. They have continually exploited the poor for their cause but haven’t done anything to lift them out of poverty. They are the malaise in our society as they corrupt the youth believing that “activism” against the government is justified leading them to leave their families to join the NPA in the hinterlands, only to die in encounters with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) later on.
It’s about time the likes of Salud and his cohorts be called to account for the consequences of their actions. We have been looking like fools before the international community for having the longest-running insurgency with no end in sight. The onus is not entirely on government as these morons are backed by socialist and communist non-government organisations (NGOs) in Europe which fund them. When will the poor realize that they’re being taken for a ride when the leader of the revolution, Jose Maria Sison, lives comfortably in Utrecht as a political refugee?",Politics
Bongbong Marcos is likely to win in 2022. Will the US intervene to prevent that?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/bongbong-marcos-is-likely-to-win-in-2022-will-the-us-intervene-to-prevent-that/,"Poll after poll over the last several years consistently showed former Senator Bongbong Marcos at the top of the popularity game — convincingly topping Robredo who supposedly beat him to the vice presidency in the 2016 elections. The most recent one, the Publicus Asia Pahayag Q3 report is particularly significant because it is the first one issued within the context of Marcos’s confirmed candidacy for president in the coming 2022 elections. The astounding 49 percent preference score BBM notched in that survey is nothing short of an absolute confronting spectre the Opposition need to come to terms with.
If BBM ascends power in 2022 to become the Philippines’ second Marcos president, the destruction of the Yellowtards will be complete. They will likely be the same shrill sabotaging Opposition that they had been since 2016, but they will be a spent force seeing that their dishonest efforts to “unify” the Opposition this year actually created more enemies amongst them than friends. Several factions refused to get in bed with Leni Robredo’s and her sidekick Kiko Pangilinan’s Yellowtard bloc and their lame efforts at rebranding and recolouring their narrative, preferring, instead, to field their own candidates. The communists have now turned hostile against their now-former allies following a tiff with them over senatorial slates.
Perhaps it is now time to turn the microscope over to the United States which, it seems, has a large stake in seeing the “right” politics prevail in these critical elections. At the very least, ensuring that a Marcos does not return to Malacanang is a matter of colonial pride. The US after all had a lot to do with the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Western Media were complicit in the elevation of “revolutionary” president Cory Aquino to political sainthood following that. And, now, Maria Ressa, CEO of “social news network” Rappler — a media organisation critical, by default, of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte and widely believed to enjoy CIA funds channeled via the Omidyar Network — had been awarded this year’s Nobel “Peace Prize”.
The planet’s Western European and North American powers-that-be are, indeed, staring into the abyss of an acute global crisis of credibility should Bongbong Marcos become president in 2022. With their local agents — the Yellowtards, ABS-CBN, and Maria Ressa — all but botching the crush-Marcos-and-Duterte-at-ALL-costs project, America may be faced with the prospect of either (1) upping the covert intervention ante or (2) rolling up their sleeves and doing the job themselves. In what form the earlier will take, short of the latter, is anyone’s guess at this point.
Then again, having suffered a humiliating and utterly messed-up retreat from Afghanistan this year, it is likely that America’s little Pacific Mini Me may be the least of their concerns for now. That too does not bode well for an Opposition desperate to win these elections. Discounting a massive American intervention this year, a glaring absence of a crooked Commision on Elections (COMELEC) technology partner and equally-crooked COMELEC head, as well as a vastly more cluey electorate we are, indeed, looking to an very interesting election in 2022.
Filipinos are being told by their former colonial masters and their local proxies that a Second Marcos Presidency is, quite simply, not allowed. How much they want to make good on that directive will be revealed in the coming months. Filipinos need to get smarter and see the shameless insult to their intelligence that is the current campaign approach of today’s Opposition for what it is.",Politics
Illusions and delusions will not win Leni Robredo and the #KakamPink mob the election,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/illusions-and-delusions-will-not-win-leni-robredo-and-the-kakampink-mob-the-election/,"Fearless. Mareng Winnie always has been. But always on the wrong side of the political fence. In her Inquirer piece today, she shouts out, “Fearless forecast: Leni will win”. Why would Leni Robredo win? Magic? That’s not an option since Andy Bautista is in exile in San Francisco. Volunteerism? This is nothing more than bandwagoning. Funny then; on that note Monsod elaborates on some of the bases of her “postive assertion”…
I was told there are over 200 volunteer organizations—some existing even before she indicated that she was running, so convinced they were that she is the best candidate. But I doubt that Leni is the sole motivation for their efforts. Beyond her, I think, they are doing it for the country.
Robredo appeals to the “ABC” crowd but these economic brackets don’t make up the bulk of the voters. The D and E demographic does. And no matter how much she bends herself over backwards, the laylayan, as she refers to them, still perceive her to be elitist.
The Publicus Pahayag survey dropped yesterday. It had her at about 23% voter preference. I would think the survey had more ABC respondents which is why she scored this high. Ditto for Bongbong Marcos (BBM) who was at 49%. After the November 15 deadline for substitution, there’s still six months left before the election. These six months will expose more of Robredo’s weaknesses. When the debates roll along, that will be the end of her. She won’t be able to hold her own against Sen. Ping Lacson and BBM. She will have her ass handed to her.
Robredo is the type of person who doesn’t really absorb the context of her job. She’s not a natural politician who has passion for what she’s doing. It’s all made up. Part of the packaging. All form, no substance. Fake it, until you make it. The same can be said of Isko Moreno which is why their camps have been at it for the whole of October. It doesn’t help that her supporters have been waging a negative campaign against her rivals. Voters want to hear about platforms in this election cycle because of the high level of uncertainty they face due to the pandemic.
The Pahayag survey had respondents ranking the economy, jobs and anxiety of being infected as their primary concerns. Mareng Winnie is probably having a deja vu moment reminiscing about the heady days leading up to Cory Aquino finally declaring she will run. Leni borrowed from the same playbook. Much consternation. Much discernment. Much prayers. Then when she announced her candidacy, it was made to appear as manna from heaven.
Monsod and other Opposition personalities have created in their ecosystem a recreation of the environment during their fight against Ferdinand Marcos. Illusions and delusions will not win them the election. You need to have a viable candidate first and Robredo isn’t viable. This is very evident in her high disapproval and low trust ratings. The clock is ticking on Robredo’s political career. It’s clear that it is only a matter of time and she better enjoy her remaining days in the limelight.",Politics
North and South UNITE across the seas: Marcos-Duterte “super bloc” sees rise of #SolidPhilippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/north-and-south-unite-across-the-seas-marcos-duterte-super-bloc-sees-rise-of-solidphilippines/,"Six months is a long time to campaign exactly the same way the Yellowtards have been campaigning. However, it is not much time to adapt to recent developments. In just the last week, a Super Bloc has formed following what had been a mysterious meeting between presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and Inday Sara Duterte. The recent announcement of the latter’s Hugpong Ng Pagbabago (HNP) party throwing its support behind Marcos’s campaign effectively creates a vast voter base that potentially dwarfs the combined base of the Opposition encompassing not just Isko Moreno and the Yellowtards but the rest of the nuisance camps. To give a bit of credit to Leni Robredo and the convenors of 1Sambayan, only a “united” Opposition could have hoped to win in 2022.
Unfortunately, hope of that “united” Opposition ever seeing the light of day has been all but crushed. Each of the current crop of Opposition players have revealed to the Filipino public their respective true natures and share only one thing amongst themselves — that they all individually want power and lack any appetite to do things for country. Indeed, the sight of Marcos and Duterte agreeing to a sensible sharing of power would indeed have been a confronting sight to Imperial Manila’s Yellowtards and those Cold War relics, the Philippines’ communist bloc. Solid Philippines supersedes old notions of a “Solid North” and “Solid South”. What is unique about this alliance is that it is founded more around two parties sharing fundamental political values — a stark contrast to the negative campaign of just about every one of the Opposition parties taking aim at national posts today.
The irony here is that while the Opposition noisily talked about “unity” for months and then failed to walk their shrill talk, the admin camp went about achieving the same quietly and with grace. That feat bodes well for what a Marcos government, supported by HNP from the south, would mean for a country long wracked by petty regionalism. Where the Opposition failed to string together words to articulate their platform, the Marcos-HNP alliance built one with no words. The impossibility of an Opposition unified bid serves as a stark backdrop to the Marcos-Duterte alliance on exhibit today.
Dream of a Solid Philippines seemed to be such a far-fetched aspiration even up to recent times. Filipinos were ruled from Imperial Manila for decades until Rodrigo Duterte finally came around and planted a Mindanaoan behind on Malacanang’s seat of power in 2016. But even with a Mindanaoan in power, the Yellowtards and communists crafted bites of rhetoric out of their crooked narrative and ideology which they used to continue to foment division across the archipelago and create an environment to perpetrate their seditious agendas. These elections now promise an entirely changed game — one where the wind had effectively been knocked out of Imperial Manila and redistributed north, south, and in-between.
Whatever credible “thought leaders” the Opposition are left with will have to get back to the drawing boards and craft new strategies to deal with the changed game that the Marcos-Duterte alliance has created. First is a credible forward-looking platform. It will have to be just as compelling as the idea of a Solid Philippines that the admin camp now walk (having had very little need for talk about it). Second is to put a stop to negative campaigning. Several decades of demonising the Marcoses and five and a half years of destabilising the Duterte administration evidently did not yield results for them. Only fools would continue this approach over the precious next six months. Third is, well, to unite under a single all-encompassing Opposition leader. Let’s just keep that last one on the table, shall we? After all, “Laban” is the Yellowtard call to action as one might recall. Never say die, right? Then again, maybe another one needs to.",Politics
Bongbong Marcos set to vindicate his father in what is to become his family’s FINAL battle with the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/bongbong-marcos-set-to-vindicate-his-father-in-what-is-to-become-his-familys-final-battle-with-the-yellowtards/,"Inquirer columnist Richard Heydarian gets it wrong again in his piece “Why the Marcos brand remains popular”. True to his drumroll style of writing where he first goes at length into some historical context for the point he would later make way way towards the end of his blurb, Heydarian starts by showing off his “knowledge” of German history writing about how “the well-meaning yet feeble Weimar Republic collapsed under the pressure of polarized and increasingly authoritarian politics, leading to the rise of Nazism.” Well, not really. The Weimar Republic collapsed because of weak leadership under the onerous terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Allies wanted to bleed Germany dry for war reparations so they could repay their debt to the United States. Hitler’s rise began shortly after and the rest, as they say, is history.
Then Heydarian goes into template mode drawing a parallel from that to apply to his take on what is happening to the Philippines today claiming that “the gathering storm of authoritarian nostalgia, and the growing appeal of the heirs of our former dictator, can be explained along a similar axis.” Thus; “[our] political leaders as well as our educators also fell far short in accomplishing their basic duties following the collapse of Ferdinand Marcos’ regime more than three decades earlier.” What followed the so-called EDSA “revolution” that supposedly toppled the Marcos regime “was the swift restoration of the old liberal elite, many of whom ended up reasserting their grip not only on the pillars of the economy but also on the vital organs of the state,” writes Heydarian.
The fact is, history was written by the victors. There was really no “revolution” at EDSA and no victory by the opposition against Marcos. It was then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile who tried to grab power plain and simple but failed. Marcos was consumed by his own hubris that he didn’t appoint a successor nor laid out a succession plan after he became seriously ill. His camp was already divided into three factions then; his wife Imelda and General Fabian Ver, Fidel Ramos and Enrile and Danding Cojuangco. Ramos and Enrile also parted ways before 1986. Danding thought that neither had it in them to mount a coup despite the rise of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM). Cojuangco relied on the loyalty of the officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to Marcos. Little did he know that he would need to go into exile ignominiously when the time came.
The matter could’ve been settled as early as 1992 but the Yellows wouldn’t give up power easily. Danding lost because the Marcos vote was split by Imelda. Joseph “Erap” Estrada was ousted after three years and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) completed her term but only because she gave the police and military what they wanted. She suffered the same fate as Erap. By the end of the Noynoy Aquino administration, Ramos had seen enough and activated his old network to get Rodrigo Duterte to run. Ramos thought he could control Duterte but the promdi had other plans. And so here we are again today in an election cycle where the Marcos scion is now the principal player in what is to be the final battle between the Yellows and the Marcoses. Is it a battle or is it just a validation of the people’s choice in 2016?
Duterte’s audacity in spending political capital is unprecedented. Going into his final eight months in office, he remains highly-popular. Few realize the situation he is in now where he has been abandoned by the power blocs supporting him because they don’t want him to build up a power bloc independent from them. Not a word has been heard from Manny Villar and GMA. The PDP-Laban is splintered and the father is caught in a feud with his daughter, who was supposed to succeed him. The loyal aide looks to be a party to the isolation of his principal as he himself has learned how to play the game. They would like to control the anointed successor who isn’t keen on being a sock puppet which is why she took herself out of the game. But she is playing her cards well by engaging in a dialogue with the Marcos’ who’s also in the same boat as her father.
The power blocs are afraid that what they stole from the Marcoses in their time of weakness will be taken back and they will be left at the mercies of what will be the Marcos-Duterte combine. Ironic since the president’s late father and former Davao Governor Vicente Duterte was a victim of a power play in the first Marcos Cabinet. Now the two sons of the patriarchs are in a position to vindicate their respective fathers. Duterte is keeping his cards close to his chest. He knows his work isn’t done yet but he understands that if the country is to have a future, it falls upon him to finish what he started, one way or the other. The Filipino is waiting for November 15 anxiously. The 2022 election could be a protracted battle or it could end before May 2022.",Politics
The Yellow Cult — turned #KakamPink scum — are the REAL threats to Democracy!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/the-yellow-cult-turned-kakampink-scum-are-the-real-threats-to-democracy/,"If you can’t beat ’em, mass-report or bully online, threaten with a lawsuit, cancel, or silence them.
The shift from yellow to pink, to be fair, could have been a very sound strategy. It’s just that, the Yellowtards forgot the most vital aspect of their supposed transformation – becoming a better alternative brand for Filipinos. The upcoming 2022 election has become but another channel through which the unravelling of the true color of those masking elitism and hypocrisy as champions of freedom of expression is exhibited to the Filipino people. That simple yet glaring flaw right there is where it all stinks, that even those who they classify as “type D and E” can smell a mile away. Such is the truth the cult of yellow-turned-fink-scam/scum are very much aware of; well at least some of them — which is why they take so much effort to reach out to the marginalized sectors with hopes of increasing their following and voter base.
Then again, how can they increase their dwindling following if they keep insulting the majority from which they are supposed to gather new allies? I do believe that they also recognize that challenge, which is why they are in a panic and going all out to shut the majority including prominent bloggers and vloggers with narratives different from theirs, through all means possible. So much for that “freedom of expression” they profess to be fighting for within an “oppressive, dictator’s” regime. The habit of shutting people down also says a lot about their already reduced number of followers. If they really did have the numbers, they would have been able to just ignore everyone who harbor opinions counter to theirs. For decades they held a monopoly over the power to ram their narratives down everyone’s throats. If their stance were indeed foolproof during those happy times (for them), their ideas could have have stood the test of time and seen them through the lead up to 2022.
If theirs is the sole truth, why are they so insecure as to habitually shut down dissenting opinions and constructs? Are they afraid to be proven wrong and called out for being frauds? Such is the biggest mistake the yellow cult is committing right now, which is driving the Filipino public to the point where they no longer care to explain their stand, because once people reach the point of ‘ah basta’ it’s pretty much checkmate — game over.
Take the supporters of Bongbong Marcos online. Despite the black propaganda being hurled from left and right towards the man, the trending comment of his supporters on even the most hostile posts against him is (sic) ‘ah basta, BBM kami.’ The people that they insulted and cancelled for more than five years are now turning against them and are cancelling them on a massive scale. Thus unfolds the nightmare right before their eyes — of their growing irrelevance and shrinking credibility as a political force. But as Sun Tzu puts it, never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake — which is why people are now laughing their hearts out at this curious sight before us of the Incredible Shrinking Opposition.",Politics

The thrust and direction of the Marcos clan have always been geared towards the revival and glory of the Maharlikans. Their underlying motivation for Filipinos to regain respect among the league of nations is a most basic ingredient for nationalists. That is why Marcos Sr.’s two decades in power had been characterized by nation building and large-scale projects for equipping and empowering Filipinos to be technologically and intellectually advanced. The formula of education, industrial prowess, military might and food security for prosperity has always worked wonders in bringing a nation on its feet. Bongbong is expected to pick up from where his father left off by pursuing the programs and strategies that were abruptly interrupted by the Yellow widow.
Isko for Decency:
Coming out from eating pagpag and sporting just underwear for magazines to make a living, Isko has come a long way with even Oxford and Harvard education under his belt. He speaks with calculated precision and has showcased plans of grandeur for the City of Manila, with a goal of making it a Singapore-class city through beautification, modernization and clean-up projects. Isko projects an image and persona of being polished, well-informed, and clean. Hardly using the foul-mouthed language we had in Digong, it will be a breather for many Filipinos to have a decent and good-looking Isko as top official for the next 6 years.
Manny for Integrity:
Anti-corruption is Manny’s key campaign slogan. As a Bible-trumping born-again Christian, he is not ashamed of quoting verses from scripture to back up his simple logic: if the Bible says it, let’s obey it to ensure all will be well for us. For the only majority-Christian nation on this side of the planet, Manny will probably best represent many Filipinos’ yearning for a moral recovery that the spiritually drought-stricken society badly needs. The fact that he has been sharing his wealth rather than stealing from state coffers is a testament and guarantee that he walks his talk. Putting dishonest officials behind bars (or even on death row) takes political will, and its once in a lifetime that a man who represents honesty is the best policy will grace the political landscape in a country bereft of true and genuine leaders. Honesty is such a lonely word, but here’s Manny to the rescue.
Bato for Order:
To guarantee no letup on the war on drugs and crime, you can choose Duterte’s right-hand man behind the war. Law and Order is what the Police force stands for and what better nation needs policing more than the Philippines? The Philippines has too many rules – that’s because Filipinos are by nature disobedient and will always find a loophole or crack to bypass any law or policy. Discipline can be learned but it takes repetition (enforced if needed) for any behavior to get ingrained into one’s coconut. Bato as the name implies gives Filipinos that much needed tough pounding to bring them in line. Law and order once established brings peace, and peace eventually brings prosperity.
Note: Ping as a choice would be similar to Bato, being himself a former police chief.
We’ll leave it to the readers to reflect on what Leni represents. It’s quite difficult to squeeze anything of value out of a Tweety Bird who thinks she’s now soaring as a Chilean Flamingo.",Politics
"By acting like an idiot in a TikTok video, Leni Robredo proves she sees the masses as a bunch of idiots",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/by-acting-like-an-idiot-in-a-tiktok-video-leni-robredo-proves-she-sees-the-masses-as-a-bunch-of-idiots/,"Opposition partisans associated with the “leading” Yellowtard bloc within it that directly support the presidential candidacy of “vice president” Leni Robredo are scrambling to justify the thinking behind a recent spate of low-brow campaign materials that have gone “viral” — for the wrong reasons. Partisan camps opposed to the Yellowtards are having a field day converting these ill-thought-out campaign graphics and videos into memes that, themselves, are going viral — for the right reasons. A particularly ill-thought-out piece of campaign collateral that somehow made it into the public space and caused a monumental cringe is a TikTok video of Robredo doing some sort of interpretative dance to communicate her so-called “platform”.
While these stunts attracted a tidal wave of ridicule from communities aligned with the administration camps, they also elicited serious inward reflection from within Opposition circles. Some Yellowtard partisans and “activists” expressed dismay over how these stunts may actually be setting back the “cause” and bringing across the wrong message to voters whose preferences they seek to convert to their camp.
Opposition volunteers coming to the defense of these cringeworthy campaign materials argue that the bigger base of voters come from the lower-income C, D, and E crowd over which these sorts of low-brow entertainment are traditionally expected to resonate. This is a typical perspective taken by chi chi private school types and Big Corporate Media execs who see the lower classes as worthy of no more than trashy entertainment and over-simplified messaging that reveals the condescending or patronising way with which the social elite regard them. Esteemed dermatologist, presumed “beauty” expert, and “human rights” advocate Winlove Mojica asserts in a recent tweet…
Napakaliit ng botante sa Class ABC kumpara sa D and E.
Kaya nga ang mga activities ng mga kakampink ay karaniwang nasa kalsada at hindi sa mga malls tulad ng Powerplant Rockwell kasi nasa kalsada ang target audience.
Nasa kalsada ang mga botong magpapanalo kay VP.
Translated: “The ABC class represent a small subset of Filipino voters compared to the D and E classes. This is why KakamPink campaign activities are performed in the streets and not in malls like Power Plant in Rockwell because the target audience are on the streets. The people who will account for the VP’s victory are on the streets.”
Logic like these can be interpreted in many ways but one thing’s certain. A presidential candidate acting like an idiot in a video because she seeks an audience with the poor may just as well be saying that the poor are idiots. The irony in all this is in how the Yellowtards had, for so long, crowned themselves “champions” of “democratic ideals”. In these instances, they are coming out first in perverting the spirit of democracy by using dishonest and intelligence-insulting measures in their desperate efforts to gain traction with a public that had long ago issued an indictment of just about everything they stand for.
In an age where Facebook is being taken to task for feeding trash to its hapless users, it comes across as a bit of a laugh that a community known for their shrill whining about all the “disinformation”, “trolls”, spam, and clickbait that pollute social media are, themselves, engaged in the production of this sort of rubbish. In her piece “I Made the World’s Blandest Facebook Profile, Just to See What Happens” published on The Atlantic, Kaitlyn Tiffany writes of the outcome of her experiment…
After just two weeks on the platform, consuming only content that Facebook’s recommendation systems selected for me, I found myself at the bottom of a rabbit hole not of extremism but of utter trash—bad advice, stolen memes, shady businesses, and sophomoric jokes repeated over and over. Facebook isn’t just dangerous, I learned. It doesn’t merely have the ability to shape offline reality for its billions of users. No, Facebook is also—and perhaps for most people—senseless and demoralizing.
Want to cleanse your timelines of trashy content that Leni Robredo’s campaign are polluting it with? Take some advise from communist activist Katrina Stuart-Santiago…
…after I removed myself from the Leni campaign groups, my newsfeed on FB has ceased to be pink. I took only about 10 days for that algorithm to change, and it’s an important thing to consider whenever you think, or imagine, that the numbers on our side are growing, or that there is “public clamor” for anything at all. Know that algorithms make us think that, for a reason.
If we want an intelligent vote prevailing in these elections, we need to remove not just the noise but the crap from the discourse. We can start with our respective social media timelines and we can follow-through by calling out people like Leni Robredo who actually produce and propagate crap. It’s really that simple.",Politics
Sara Duterte’s VP candidacy: Yellowtards will be crying bloody “mockery of democracy” over the next six months!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/sara-dutertes-vp-candidacy-yellowtards-will-be-crying-bloody-mockery-of-democracy-over-the-next-six-months/,"What else would one expect from a crybaby Opposition of no substance other than to see them criticising the rules of the game they had signed up to when they realise they are losing? Whatever news that would have come out as the week ends with the Commission on Elections’ (COMELEC) “substitution” deadline today (they don’t work Sundays), you could bet your pwet that the Yellowtards will be out on a shrill tililing rampage to end all tililing rampages whatever the outcome.
With Sara Duterte now running as Vice President for Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s Lakas-CMD, the Yellowtards will be going into a fit. This is, of course, just the latest episode of a long tradition of games of musical chairs that have long been perfectly legal — not the shocking “assault on Philippine democracy” that Yellowtard “thought leaders” make it out to be. If the Opposition had only really understood that the objective of elections is to win popularity, not God’s “graces”, they probably would not have been stuck today with Leni Robredo — the dud at the apex of media adulation campaigns — and the ill-conceived Pinkoloid brand she is in the midst of that had so far done nothing but rack up cringe points for the Opposition.
With Bongbong Marcos’s presidential campaign effectively being complemented by Ms Duterte as vice president, the election is a done deal. In the vernacular, tapos na boksing. The Yellowtards and communists have played all their aces — 30 years of Martial Law Crybabyism, years of ill-gotten-wealth-envy, millions of inches of victim porn blurbs on countless newspaper columns, using a Nobel “Peace Prize” to buy credibility — Filipinos have seen and heard it all, and still they continue to reject Yellowtardism and its handmaid communism. What other anti-Marcos and anti-Duterte drivel can the Yellowtards and communists cough up in the next six months?
Well they can either ratchet up the inventiveness of their negative campaign chops further or, wait for it, focus on uplifiting the quality of their campaign. They will have to match the eloquence of Marcos, the sheer strength of Ms Duterte’s presence, and the tandem’s formidable collective gravitas. More radically, they could ditch or throw under the bus the bottom-feeders among their lot — Robredo and, possibly, Ping Lacson and channel all remaining resources to the most winnable — very likely Isko Moreno. Anything but a Marcos or Duterte in 2022, right? Well now’s the time to really find out how badly the Opposition want that outcome.
And as to the communists, where are they in all this? Having tried a lukewarm participation in legal politics and having been burnt badly by attempts to get in bed with the Yellowtards, the commies have their tried, tested, and failed fallback — terrorism in the hinterlands packaged as a “people’s revolution” that aims to install a “dictatorship of the proletariat”. At least the commies are consistent in their anti-Marcos and anti-Duterte moronism. Can’t say the same for the Yellowtards though.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s “I am not corrupt” and “helping the poor” rhetoric an INSULT to Filipino voters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/leni-robredos-i-am-not-corrupt-and-helping-the-poor-rhetoric-an-insult-to-filipino-voters/,"A common defensive argument routinely issued by Leni Robredo’s Yellowtard supporters is that the “vice president” is “not corrupt”. Yes indeed, she is not that among many other things that she is not. That does not mean she will be a good leader, of course. In fact, there really is not much her camp is claiming that she is other than one who “helps the poor” which, come to think of it, any other politician and his dog claims to also be.
Consider that the late former President Noynoy Aquino also run on a similar bullshit platform, that he is the Son of Filipino Political Gods and, as such, a virtual saint who “helps the poor” and regards them as his “boss”. He too was, Yellowtard logic dictates, “not corrupt”. Indeed, the tagline of his administration was “Kung walang kurap walang mahirap” (“If there is nobody corrupt then there is nobody poor”). Apart from being a nice rhyme, the statement makes no sense considering a lack of corruption does not necessarily cause a lack of poverty.
The dishonesty in the Yellowtard rhetoric notwithstanding, Aquino went on to win the 2010 election anyway. Unfortunately for Filipinos, he presided over one of the most corrupt administrations on record. Erupting under his watch was an enormous pork barrel scandal to the tune of billions and billions of pesos disappearing into the shady pet “projects” of a who’s-who of members of Congress and their henchmen in various non-government organisations (NGOs). Aquino’s sidekick, then Budget Secretary Butch Abad engineered much of the accounting slights of hand that enabled these crooked appropriations. Did heads roll as a result? Nada.
Thus one could now appreciate just how tone-deaf Leni Robredo’s I-Am-Not-Corrupt rhetoric is. Tone-deaf because it deliberately ignores the billions of pesos lost to the Yellowtard Era’s pork barrel excesses and tone-deaf because they now laughably use it as campaign fodder again — basically demonstrating the small regard they have for Filipino voters’ intellectual faculties. Would Filipinos still elect someone whose campaign platform is built almost entirely around not being corrupt? Yellowtard “economist” Winnie Monsod thinks so…
But a Leni presidency would be a game-changer. They would have no hold over her—because money has never gotten to her head. Nine years in politics, and still no splashy cars, no large houses, no jewelry, and still taking public transport (!). No potential lines to get to her—her husband (Jesse Robredo would have made an excellent president as well) is dead, her three girls hate politics and drugs.
One cannot really call that drivel bullshit because it is just so downright corny. Oh wait, we left out one other thing Monsod writes that describes that other pillar of Yellowtard corniness;
Moreover, she is the only candidate with hands-on experience working with the poor, the marginalized.
All hail “The Poor”.
The Poor are that other god traditional politicians prostate themselves to whenever the bells of the Church of Philippine Elections start tolling. Leni Robredo is indeed that quintessential saint of traditional Philippine politics and Winnie Monsod is her prophet.
Aren’t we all just so sick of politicians who “help the poor”? It looks like we actually finally are sick of that crock. Despite all Yellowtardom’s choir of angels singing praises to the “plight” of “The Poor”, they still fail to get their Madre a decent ranking in the popularity polls.
The fact is, the Philippines’ prosperous future is not hinged on “The Poor” getting their ayuda-funded three meals a day. Prosperity will be built on the backs of the country’s best, brightest, most promising, most intelligent, best-fed, best-educated, and most affluent and enterprising citizens. We talk about capital investment — whether foreign or domestic in origin — being the key input into a growing and strengthening economy. Well guess what: capital does not come from the blood and sweat of labourers and the whining of mendicants and their communist champions. It comes from the economic product of entrepreneurs, innovative and creative people, scientists, engineers, and artists — people who are worth investing in and supporting.
Being “not corrupt” and “helpful” to “The Poor” does not make one the sort of leader who will lead a promising people to greatness. To promise — and desperately argue — that one is “not corrupt” and “helps the poor” is a downright dishonest way to pitch one’s self to Filipino voters as their future leader.",Politics
The Dutertes need to ditch Bong Go to secure their legacy and assure their place in Philippine history,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/the-dutertes-need-to-ditch-bong-go-to-secure-their-legacy-and-assure-their-place-in-philippine-history/,"A united camp once regarded as inclusive of both supporters of Bongbong Marcos and those of the Duterte family is no more thanks to events that transpired over the weekend. Sara Duterte’s filing of candidacy for vice president under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s Lakas-CMD party was regarded by many as her move to run in tandem with Bongbong Marcos’s presidential bid under Partido Federalismo effectively unifying the Marcos and Duterte support base coalescing a formidable bloc of voters that stretches from Luzon and through down south to Mindanao.
Unfortunately, the party was crashed by Bong Go who, apparently with the backing of President Rodrigo Duterte, lodged his bid for the presidency shortly after. That plus Duterte’s statements against Marcos in an interview with vlogger Byron Cristobal a.k.a. Banat By over the weekend where he reportedly suggested that the former senator along with Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo were “pro communists” effectively split the admin camp into two — those who supported the Marcos-Sara tandem and those who were behind Go and what then was the possibility of President Duterte running for vice president.
Turns out the plot twists hadn’t all been revealed yet, however. News broke today that President Duterte would, instead, be running for senator which now puts him in a strong position for the Senate presidency if he wins (which is very likely). For now, this eases tensions a bit among Marcos and Duterte supporters. However it is likely that Duterte along with Go will go on over the next six months to take a consistent adversarial position against Team BBM-Sara.
The Opposition are effectively marginalised as not much else in the way of any further innovation in their campaign strategy is likely to be forthcoming. Beyond demonization of the Marcoses and the Dutertes, the Opposition “led” by “vice president” Leni Robredo have not much to show nor stand for. The most recent popularity survey conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS) reportedly shows Robredo moving up to second rank at 18 percent of respondents favouring her for president overtaking rivals Isko Moreno and Manny Pacquiao. However she still trails Marcos by a wide margin the latter attracting the preferences of 47 percent of survey respondents.
It remains to be seen whether Go will persist with his presidential candidacy. Voters supporting the administration continuity platform (and mostly behind Duterte’s federalist inclinations which are seemingly shared by Marcos) are overwhelmingly on the side of the BBM-Sara tandem. Go is widely-perceived to be a leech-like hanger-on to Brand Duterte and not much else. Indeed, Go’s being a senator and continuing to act like a 24/7 personal aide of the President was absolute bad form that did not escape the scrutiny — even disdain — of even the most loyal members of the “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) community. Retired Lieutenant General and former National Security Council Director-General Antonio Parlade Jr who led the Duterte administration’s anti-commumist campaign reportedly described Go as a national “problem” who exerts an inordinate amount of influence over the president.
Asked why he was running against a fellow Duterte administration official, Parlade told reporters: “I cannot align with Senator Bong Go. I’m sorry but isa siya, kasama siya sa mga problema ng bayan natin (he’s among the problems of our country).”
Further to that…
Part of the problem is that Go was the one controlling the decisions made by Duterte, he said. “Wala akong beef with Senator Bong Go. I just don’t like the way he does things including controlling the decisions of the President,” This is common knowledge among officers and soldiers in the military and the Philippine Army, and even Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, according to Parlade.
With President Duterte’s term coming to an end and the strong possibility of a new chapter in his political career opening up in 2022, he and his party need to seriously consider the growing liability within their ranks that is Bong Go. It would be a shame if a brilliant legacy is ruined by a barnacle with an outsized ambition. The arithmetic is quite simple and comes down to the one option that makes the most sense: secure the legacy, solidify the alliance of a Senate with a strong Duterte within it and a powerful Marcos-Sara tandem in Malacanang, and throw Go under the bus. Ditching Go just makes perfect sense in the bigger scheme of the very exciting era ahead.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s reverse metamorphosis: do Filipinos want a mother for a president?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/leni-robredos-reverse-metamorphosis-do-filipinos-want-a-mother-for-a-president/,"Looking at the most recent of “vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo’s recorded campaign videos, one can’t help but wonder what it is exactly she thinks she is doing that could possibly convince Filipinos to vote for her. Does she think Filipinos want another mother figure? Because it seems that this is the sort of image she’s trying to project nowadays having ditched her eye liners for the pa-concerned effect patronising squint and exchanging her slim-fitting suits for the frumpy maternal tents that give her the lump-like look we see today.
Reverse metamorphosis is what seems to be at work here. Rather than transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly, she’s gone the other way, coming out of a makeover evidently engineered by her expensive campaign “strategists” looking more larval. Compare her look today to five years ago when a wide-eyed Robredo exuded a vibrant keenness to lead Filipinos and not the doting mother-hen figure she cuts today that could only appeal to Filipinos who prefer wallowing in victimhood over taking charge of their fortunes.
What sort of people does Robredo want to lead — a people who look to be mobilised to build a strong nation or a people looking upward with mouths agape in anticipation of their next ayuda fix?
Robredo’s emotional appeal insults Filipinos who aspire to be independent, assertive, and prosperous by gaslighting them into believing that it is only a messiah that can set them down the right path. What is that “right” path, for that matter? Robredo, unfortunately, does not spell that out either and the answer to that question remains one of the biggest mysteries of her campaign.",Politics

What’s up with the size of these works? Is it to ensure high visibility and maximise eyeball retention? Could it be to inspire awe and veneration? Could these also be monuments to the awesomeness of the presumed volunteerism that supposedly characterises Robredo’s #KakamPink campaign? Evidently it is all of the above. One is reminded of the zeal with which artists from antiquity all the way up to recent times would scramble over one another to paint and sculpt their gods and idols for their greater glories.
One need look no further for examples of disturbingly similar works of art motivated by such cults of personality. These are tools for the sorts of myth-making the Yellowtard bloc of the Opposition are particularly known for and, as seen today, hopelessly rely on to prop up political profile that is devoid of both substance and authenticity.
The larger than life and idealised depiction of the subjects and scenery in these murals aim to evoke the sort of emotional response that burns narratives into the long-term memories of those who view them.
Do these stunts contribute to making voters better-informed and more intellectually-equipped to make the required decisions in the lead up to the coming elections? Very unlikely considering that these stunts constitute no more than appeals to emotion and not much else. After all, what is it about Robredo’s qualification to lead a nation of more than 100 million that could possibly be learned from a gigantic mural? Indeed, one does struggle to learn anything even from the speeches Robredo delivers that were crafted by her handlers to make her sound smart. What more from a picture, right?
Filipinos need to see through these dishonest stunts that aim to hijack their cognitive facilities to a “cause” that is bereft of any substance. Putting up murals that beg to be looked up to in awe is not the campaign style of a candidate or party that supposedly espouses modern democratic ideals. True democracy requires an electorate that applies modern thinking to making those important choices its members are expected to make in participating in this important exercise — not a brainless fandom that bows to idols painted on concrete walls by a bunch of virtue signallers.",Politics
The Real New World Order,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/real-new-world-order-teichrib/,"I recently began following Christian author, scholar and speaker Michael Heiser, whose work I find revolutionary and makes the most sense about Christian doctrine. He has an interesting Youtube channel called Fringepop321 where he tackles ancient aliens, UFOs, Bible analysis, cryptozoology, the occult and all the weird stuff from a Christian perspective.
But among Heiser’s videos, what got me writing were episodes where another Christian author, Carl Teichrib, was his guest. One of those episodes had the words “New World Order” in the title. So I watched, and what a revelation it was to me.
Teichrib agrees that the New World Order I described in an earlier article, the secret society-manipulated thing, is a caricature. And, as I suspected, it covers up the real New World Order, something that is in the open, something that people may not find sinister at first, but it is when you get to the bottom of it.
Teichrib related that he had been going to New Age conventions to learn about their ideas and use the chance to evangelize. He had been to the various iterations of the Parliament of World Religions, for example, where representatives from all faiths converge. Christians, Bahai, Buddhism, Hindu, Shinto, modern pagans, Wiccans, Maharishi, Sufism, Satanism, occultists and even Ayahuasca attended these. He also described other organizations, including non-governmental organizations and special interest groups such as the World Federalist Organization/Citizens for Global Solutions. The goal of the group as claimed is world peace.
So what’s sinister with this, you may ask? They’re coming together and working for peace! The problem is that they want that peace achieved on their own terms and not anybody else’s, and this could degrade into something that undermines people’s freedoms.
First, Teichrib said that this group of world religions doesn’t stop at religion. Their consensus is that world peace is possible only by establishing a world government – likely one that they are the author of. In other words, they want to cross over from religion into politics. They want to establish their own order on the world, a New World Order under themselves. Teichrib called this spiritual politics.
Those involved want things like a world taxation system set up, payable to their government. And, wouldn’t a world government have tussles with sovereign nations? That leads to another point, they want to bring down the sovereignty of nations. It sounds attractive to “peaceniks” at first (I’ll admit it appealed to me before too), but it actually has more consequences than benefits in practice.
Teichrib’s website is named Forcing Change, which is a good way to put what the religions parliament wants. He also lays bare his biases: embracing an evangelical Christian perspective; pro-liberty versus politically imposed equality; pro-individualistic versus consensus collectivism; and pro-free market. I embrace the same things as the better path to true world peace. But these are also the areas that are threatened by this new world order.
Despite the participants being from different religious backgrounds and the claim of being tolerant of all beliefs, Teichrib hints that the actual goal is make all people accept one belief, which is Monism or Oneism. This is the belief that all is one and everything will eventually merge back into one mass. The likely expectation is that all belief systems will soon merge into one, so the parliament thinks, let’s speed that up.
I believe this expectation is wrong. This is because belief systems have elements that conflict. If I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior, should I also accept Buddha, Tammuz and Rhonda Byrne as my saviors if the parliament says so? Some religions take narcotic drugs; so should I be forced to take the drugs just for the sake of acceptance? What if another religion says taking narcotics is wrong? Problems like these should be obvious even when people don’t try to look at it closely. These and many other things are good reasons for Evangelical Christians to refuse to join.
Here’s something interesting: during a meeting in the 2018 parliament that carried themes of Love and Inclusion, a progressive baptist minister (yes, some Christians get misled) put together a Hindu sand mandala (a sort of sand painting) of the goddess Kali holding up a severed head of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and of people who confirmed him following his nomination to the US Supreme Court. Then the minister and other members proceeded to dance around it in a sort of cursing ceremony and they destroyed the representations of Kavanaugh and the others. Again, the event’s theme was Love and Inclusion. Yeah, right. I agree with Michael Heiser’s reaction, it is disturbing.
Next, politically imposed equality. As the mandala episode suggests, the parliament is dominated by left-leaning people and social justice warriors or SJWs. So you can expect people twisting ideas of justice here.
For example, when the Bible says, let he who has two blankets share one with an unfortunate fellow without one (or, for the Philippine context, someone with two electric fans), the SJWs will twist that into, patrol the houses and find someone who has two blankets. Forcibly take one and give it to someone without. And, there are sure to be some SJWs who will just take one’s blanket and give it to someone else (perhaps on the basis that the one with the blanket is purportedly rich and the other poor) – which means things are still at zero and someone still lacks a blanket.
In Teichrib’s own example, he says during a 2010 world religions summit, a Salvation Army representative proposed that instead of allowing each person to have their own bike, make them share one bike in the community (it’s in the LDBC 2019 video). That, Teichrib said, was tried in Venezuela, Russia and Eastern Europe and did not work.
What happens when socialism actually gets applied so fervently is that redistribution becomes middle-class to poor, not rich to poor; but the rich steal the credit for it. The rich actually stay rich despite redistribution policies, simply because they’re in control. Also, redistribution-based ideologies don’t solve the patron-client culture of poorer countries (like ours), but actually help maintain it. The rich as patrons use redistribution and poverty porn to keep their clients as clients. This would also be against the free market ideal listed above.
But we know that such ideas find their way into the Philippines. These are ideas that Filipino wokes, such as those among the anti-Duterte crowd, hold. And yes, even among Christians and Catholics. The statements a while back of Leni Robredo and Socrates Villegas on vote-buying seem to reflect such influences. Of course, there’s that observation that the social justice agenda of the local Catholic Church, perhaps even “liberation theology” in the Vatican itself, reflects infiltration by pagan humanistic and leftist ideas (I recall the ridiculous “no to war toys” movement before, which I believe had its origins from outside Christianity).
Next, pro-individualistic versus consensus collectivism. Monistic ideas seem to imply that, since we are all supposed to be one,  human free will can be called an aberration. Some people want to break down the natural, God-endowed individuality that people have in order to make them part of the oneness. According to Teichrib, group members have expressed the intention that, if people in the world don’t embrace their ideals, they could use force. Of course, why else are they trying to transition to political control?
So some will ask, what’s wrong with you? Who cares if some rights are trampled on. that thing is for peace! But it’s forced peace, which is oppressive. In effect, it’s not peace at all. It will lead to persecution of people who hold on to their beliefs, which is a basic human right. It should alarm those who value liberty.
It’s both interesting and alarming that politicians and former world leaders attend this. Former Canadian prime minister Kim Campbell attended. Hillary Clinton also sent a letter when she couldn’t attend. I also saw anthropologist Jane Goodall and Queen Rayna of Jordan listed in a report. Al Gore’s daughter Karenna attended the 2015 parliament and afterwards went on to promote climate change stuff at Paris. Members of the group are among the staunch supporters of the Carbon Tax and similar environmental efforts, so I’ll not be surprised if Greta Thunberg or those close to her are involved. Come to think of it, Teichrib says some environmentalists at the parliament want humanity to worship the Earth as a goddess. Christians might be told to go along with it, and if they refuse, political strong-arming may be used against them.
So with this, I think of Maria Ressa. She was granted the Nobel Peace Prize, but what she does is actually challenge the sovereignty of the current Philippine government… Hmm, Peace through challenging sovereignty? Could there be a connection between her and the parliament of religions? It’s possible that some wealthy people attend the parliament and are encouraged to use their funds for initiatives that undermine the sovereignty of nations and the rights of people who disagree with them. That’s why I believe the idea of George Soros, Pierre Omidyar or other businessmen funding efforts to overthrow governments is not far-fetched. Teichrib also mentioned connections with the International Criminal Court, which intends to try President Rodrigo Duterte for purported crimes.
I believe that, in the Philippines, a community of similar people is already working their way into politics to try to make into policy politically imposed equality, anti-individualistic consensus collectivism and anti-free market views. Then resistance to these will also be branded as being a racist, fascist, dictator, or whatever pejorative normally lobbed against “evil people.” This is terrible to put in a world government.
I remember that my church’s founder, Herbert W. Armstrong, used to parrot that a world government was also the way to peace. But instead of being under humans, Christ, a real divinity, is the one expected to run this world government. I of course believe that this is better. Humans are not suited to rule the world.
Like I said about communism, strong centralized control in the hands of a few flawed people is susceptible to serious mistakes, the worst being deaths. For example, most plane crashes have been traced to human error. Some pilots with issues even crash planes deliberately, bringing loads of people with them. What if you find people like these in a world government, in charge of millions of people? This sounds like a nightmare. This is also why the powers of consensus over individuals should be greatly limited.
The underlying theme of this Monist movement as Teichrib implies is the same as Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret that I discussed before: that humanity should not worship any god anymore and should declare itself as god. But, for me, this is one of the sources of, not a solution to, the world’s evils. What this movement seems to be doing is making a sort of exclusive club, whose members believe that the world should be populated only by other people who think like themselves. They want to remake the world into their own image. Or they believe their ideas are so “good” that others must try them. Those who refuse or have different ideas are “evil,” so these must be dealt with and not tolerated. Since they’re after political power now, things may go beyond just making a mere sand mandala or effigy and reach the point of institutionalized discrimination, having someone jailed on trumped-up charges, or even worse.
If you think I’m scaremongering or badmouthing others, Teichrib said he had been receiving threats from members of the group. I haven’t read his book Game of Gods, but I’m sure all that information is there. This is something that people who value their liberty need to be wary of and be ready to resist when the time comes.
You might say, perhaps there are people who are sincere in that parliament about doing good? Yes, I believe there are. Teichrib himself could be considered one of them. But I also believe such people walk out from meetings when they disagree with what members of the parliament propose (Teichrib in one of the videos linked below tells of when he and another Christian walked out of a heated meeting). Those who stay are likely the people who’ve compromised their values just to go with the crowd.
For me, no hegemony, school of thought, ideology or whatever thing that is humanity’s creation should rule the world. That includes whatever the parliament I described is pushing. They claim that it is for peace, but I find it misguided if they are resorting to political power to enforce it.
I also disagree also with Monism. Everything is not one (even if that is a famous line from Transformers the Movie). For me, merging consciousness like the Eternals’ Uni-mind and losing our free will as a result is a farce. It also doesn’t make sense – we have free will at first, then we lose it later? I prefer evangelical Christianity because it recognizes that we are individuals (Rom. 14:12, each of us makes an account of ourselves), each of us a “one” that has a responsibility to one’s self as well as others and God. And when people help others under this condition, rather than under forced redistribution, it is more sincere and helpful. Peace is more peaceful when individuals freely embrace it rather than get forced into it.

Going senile? Duterte’s popguns ablaze vs BBM in support of sidekick Bong Go!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/going-senile-dutertes-popguns-ablaze-vs-bbm-in-support-of-sidekick-bong-go/,"Gloves are off! President Rodrigo Duterte is now launching a full attack on Partido Federalismo presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos who is running in tandem with Lakas-CMD vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte, the president’s daughter. As expected, Opposition partisans are watching this unfolding saga closely with many of them now latching on to every bit of ululation Duterte utters about Marcos. This after spending the last five years in a shrill fit of pointing out that nothing that comes out of the mouth of Duterte holds any truth. Chalk another one up for renowned crooked inconsistency of the Yellowtards!
Over the last several days since propping up sidekick Bong Go as his preferred presidentiable, President Duterte has been out arms flailing sputtering various nebulous factoids about his man’s formidable Number One rival. At one point, Marcos is, we are told, a “pro-communist”. Then in his latest cluster bombing run, he is supposedly a cocaine user. Whatever the case Duterte says he is also baffled by Bongbong Marcos’s consistent popularity claiming that the former senator had not really achieved much.
Is Duterte a credible judge of Marcos’s character? It depends on what timeframe within which one considers that question. Back in 2018 Reuters reported that “Duterte could resign if Marcos Jr becomes VP”…
Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the president had a “real, genuine wish to step down” if a qualified leader could replace him. Marcos was among those he would prefer, Roque said.
“If there’s development and he will win the protest and he becomes the vice president, yes, he will make true his word,” Roque told a regular news briefing.
In a statement, Marcos expressed his gratitude to Duterte for showing faith in him, but said the president should finish his term.
It was all nice and peachy between the two men back then with Marcos exhibiting his usual grace in his response to that…
“I urge him not to leave the presidency as our people still need him for the betterment of our lives and our country,” Marcos said.
On that note, it is worth noting that Marcos is not known for any sort of negative campaigning. It is ironic then that Duterte who had once been on the same boat as the Marcoses in being subject to the mononamic vilification campaigns of the Yellowtards and communists is now himself engaging in the very same practice. Turns out Duterte is not above the very sort of dishonest rhetoric that lost the Yellowtards an entire nation over two national elections.
What can be worse than the Yellowtards? Turns out worse parties do exist. At least the Yellowtards are consistent in their shrill Martial Law Crybabyism even if they may change colour from time to time. One now wonders in light of recent events where all this puts the true “DDS” — the ones who themselves are guilty of the same bowing to cults of personality that the Yellowtards have long been criticised and ridiculed for. Thus the whole trouble with loyalty to personalities rather than consist critical thought on the back of sound and stable principles.",Politics
Why Bongbong Marcos should stop campaigning RIGHT NOW,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/why-bongbong-marcos-should-stop-campaigning-right-now/,"Why should Bongbong Marcos continue his campaign? He has been leading in all the popularity polls for years without lifting a finger, without having to be visible, without having to engage in publicity stunts, without having to do pa-kuwela things on TikTok. Marcos supposedly lost the vice presidency in 2016 in what we are led to believe was a neck-and-neck race against Leni Robredo. Yet, following that, Marcos’s popularity numbers persisted. Robredo’s, on the other hand, vanished mysteriously — as if her popularity never existed. It leads us to wonder now: Did Robredo actually garner the votes to pose a challenge to Marcos back in 2016 to begin with, much less beat him? The answer to that question will be shrouded in mystery forever just as the murder of Ninoy Aquino Jr. in 1983 remains the same despite his widow and then his son becoming presidents in 1986 and 2010 respectively.
Now, despite Robredo and other Opposition candidates enjoying two- to three-month head starts in their respective campaigns, Marcos continues to top the polls, specifically in two Publicus Asia surveys and one conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS). Marcos topped them all despite Robredo and her “KakamPink” following mounting one of the shrillest campaigns in Philippine history. In his piece “There will be no cheating in May 2022” published on The Freeman, veteran columnist Jerry Suico Tundag warns…
When you are ahead and ahead this big, your greatest enemy will be your own self. Bongbong has to do something particularly crazy, stupid, and hare-brained to spoil and compromise his enviable position. The disqualification cases against his candidacy that are mushrooming left and right of him are the surest signs of a desperation by his enemies that can only stem from the realization of imminent losing.
Indeed, it is likely that the people who originally voted for him in the vice presidential race of 2016 form the bedrock of Marcos’s voter base. It is likely that this bloc of original voters are so convinced that Marcos had been cheated out of the presidency back then that they are the most unlikely to be converted to other candidates. For this bloc of voters, there is still a score that needs to be settled. With a rock-solid base like that and what the survey numbers seem to be telling us is further growth on top of that means a Marcos presidency is all but inevitable. Even if the Yellowtards somehow manage to pull an extra-electoral derailment of Marcos’s run towards the presidency (i.e. if at least one of the disqualification petitions they are lobbing from all angles manages to hit its target), the vindication of the Marcos’s is all but sealed.
Tundag writes, “[disqualify] Bongbong and the next president will be very weak, not because he or she inherently is, but because we shall have weakened the only real foundation we ever had.”
…May 2022 will pass judgment on the Marcos legacy through Bongbong. Let us allow that to freely happen. The other reason is that it is too scary to contemplate disqualifying a candidate enjoying such a lead as Bongbong has now.
Winning a basketball match because you had your opponent’s best player kneecapped isn’t very satisfying — an empty victory at best. Of course, sportsmanship and seeing a game resolved by the better team is just not how the ethical compass of the Opposition is calibrated. The Yellowtards, after all, want power at all costs, even to the extent of weakening or altogether destroying Philippine democracy. They’ve done it before. These elections makes it imperative for them to win at all costs. We will find out soon to what extent they will assure themselves that outcome.",Politics
The Opposition is fighting a losing battle – can they STILL win?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/the-opposition-is-fighting-a-losing-battle-can-they-still-win/,"The Yellowtards are essentially fighting a losing battle. In fact, they have been for some years now. Their losing streak started in 2016 (or sometime before that), was reaffirmed in 2019, and, in the lead up to today, kept getting validated in survey after survey conducted by reputable polling firms. Being the leading Opposition bloc and with presidential candidate Leni Robredo being seen to being the “leader” of the Philippine Opposition, the Yellowtards need to soldier on — at least because an election won’t be an election unless there is an opposition to the incumbent (even to at least serve as comedy relief). There is, however, change in strategy that needs to be considered when confronting the fact of this losing battle. Often this requires minimising losses. That is, if you can’t win, options need to be explored to reduce the size of your imminent loss.
Even if the Yellowtards “win” in May 2022 they will still lose. This is because the only way they can win is to cut down administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and his running mate vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte from the knees. By the looks of it, the only option available to them to achieve that end is to see their disqualification petition against Marcos succeed. If that succeeds and Robredo manages to win the presidency, they will need to consider the likelihood that, over the next six years, an enormous number of hopping mad pro-Marcos supporters feeling double-deprived will be waiting to “work” with her government. It is also very likely that Robredo’s lack of leadership chops and weak grasp of public administration will be amplified as the pink shade of her honeymoon with the Filipino public fades.
If Marcos and Duterte win in May 2022, the Yellowtards will have the unenviable record of losing three national elections in succession. The brand will be crushed, their ranks and rickety coalitions torn apart by internal strife and finger-pointing, the oligarchs and business interests that bankrolled their campaign will get in bed with the winners, and the communists will be hunkered down even more both literally and figuratively lobbing mortar shells in all directions and at any party they see as not subscribed to their violent ideology. Amid this chaos will be standing the most powerful Philippine government since the 1986 EDSA “revolution”. That initial chaos will therefore not last very long.
We can see here that whatever way things go, the Yellowtards will lose. The only metric that remains for them to ponder is by how much. The size of that measure is one of the few things that still remains within their control. Face is obviously a big deal with the Yellowtards. They stand to lose a lot of it. They will lose their ascendancy as champions of a “democracy” they supposedly “won” against “the dictator” because right before them will be sitting in Malacanang no less than “the dictator’s son” himself. They will lose the lofty place they once held as the very definition of what it means to be a “freedom-loving” Filipino — because a return of a Marcos to Malacanang will be an indictment of this “freedom-loving” narrative that Filipinos will have rejected as a dishonest and empty slogan by then. Control over vital national assets and the business deals that will make — or break — personal and corporate bank accounts will change hands. This will be specially for cases where assets were summarily seized and re-allocated over the three-decade campaign of vindictiveness mounted by the Yellowtards since 1986.
How much of that tidal wave of loss are the Yellowtards even beginning to grasp as their campaign flounders under the weight of bad decisions, bad brand management, bad leadership, inept coalition-buiilding, and the bankruptcy of statesmanship we see today?
The Yellowtards need to start taking stock of the losses they still have time to cut. Perhaps they need to consider carefully Robredo herself. If there is a single big reason why the Opposition had failed to “unite” and continue, even today, to fragment further, it would be Leni Robredo. Her ill-thought-out PR stunts cause excruciating cringe reflexes even amongst her #KakamPink lot. The incoherent position she takes when regarding her future role as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has turned former allies in the Philippines’ communist cadre into sworn enemies. Rather than inspire evangelism in her campaign she induces feelings of superiority, self-righteousness, and elitism amongst her top “influencers” and “thought leaders”. Instead of moving on on the back of a forward-looking platform, she retards the minds of her supporters by keeping them imprisoned in Martial Law Crybabyism and emotionally-blackmails them into fearing a “return to authoritarianism”.
What can the Yellowtards do to cut their losses this late into the campaign? They need to face facts and study the data. What’s the point in having the loyalties of the student bodies of the chichiest Katipunan schools if they cannot apply an intelligent and scientific approach to evaluating how they navigate the intractable situation they find themselves in today? Perhaps they could start by firing the idiots who came up with the sissy Pink brand theme that hobbles Robredo’s campaign today and alienates a Filipino public that, despite what their wokedom like to believe, remain deeply-conservative and barebone-basics-focused. The Ateneo, after all, is blue, La Salle is Green, and UP Diliman is maroon. Which school is pink? Under normal circumstances nobody in their right would deliberately brand themselves pink. Robredo had that effect on a handful of morons. Her only success to date was in the ability of that handful of morons to convince thousands of others to temporarily suspend their natural aversion to the colour.",Politics
China relations is a critical foreign policy issue of the incoming administration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/china-relations-is-a-critical-foreign-policy-issue-of-the-incoming-administration/,"Beyond the turmoil and bloodshed of Chinese nationalism, the Chinese Communist Party was officially founded a century ago. The Chinese civilization suffered humiliation in the hands of Western powers and its rising neighbor, Imperial Japan. As the Russians were challenging their northern borders, the Japanese expanded their territory in Manchuria. Tokyo and its military capability seemed boundless, as they encroached on Chinese territory, further weakening the Kuomintang who defiantly resisted Japanese militarism. Following the dropping of ferocious bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki paired with Soviet annexation of South Sakhalin, Japan surrendered in 1945 and, later, the Chinese Civil War erupted that pitted the Communists against the Kuomintang. The latter suffered great losses, which caused them to retreat to modern-day Taiwan. On the other hand, the former gained the upper hand, declaring the formation of the People’s Republic in 1949. During this time, Chinese communism was overshadowed by a man named Mao Zedong.
Chairman Mao Zedong is being credited as the man who gave birth to what China is today, even though numerous political scientists and economic analysts strongly denounce his methods, policies, and innumerable atrocities. When Deng Xiaoping took over, he positioned the People’s Republic to adopt socialism with Chinese characteristics, where economic liberalization jumpstarted the economy and was enhanced with the adoption of special economic zones which, in turn, became the foundations for the transformation of China’s skyline. Years of impressive economic growth lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty, and then came Xi Jinping.
President Xi Jinping is one of the most powerful men on this planet, heading a country with the largest population armed with nuclear weapons. As the face of the People’s Republic, he has the second biggest economy behind him despite his authoritarian tendencies that are far from being unnoticeable. He plans to make China a significant player in the world stage while leaving a legacy for his country — a commitment that is making other nations uneasy. Unfortunately, the Philippines is one of those neighboring countries. With such realities, what should the in-coming Philippine president do to address rising Chinese assertiveness?
According to John Mearsheimer, the author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics and a renowned intellectual in the field of international relations, there are five assumptions that should be considered in my attempt to apply the theory of offensive realism in this context. First, the international order is in a state of anarchy, where there is no hierarchy of countries. Second, each country has a degree of exerting offensive military power through their population and wealth. Third, countries are unsure of the intentions of others. Fourth, a country’s survival is its primary interest. Lastly, all nation-states act rationally in accordance to their interests. These bedrock assumptions can be witnessed as to how historical and global politics have unfolded.
In the Philippine setting, Chinese assertions in the South China Sea are becoming more aggressive. Aside from the various military outposts that are being constructed, various naval vessels are being stationed along these areas. These range from relatively small fishing ships that are manned by Chinese militia under the guise of being ordinary fishermen, to larger patrol cutters that have the words “China Coast Guard” written on their decks. They even have the capability to stay afloat in tropical storms due to their massive tonnage. This salami-slicing approach of territorial acquisition caused various concerns beyond Southeast Asia as the aforementioned sea is an important trade route where various goods are shipped internationally. The Chinese behemoth is acting not in terms of what is accepted as morally sound by international standards, but in accordance to what Beijing thinks as its “realpolitik”. Chinese behavior in these waters cannot be checked and the arbitration ruling in The Hague cannot be implemented due to the international order’s anarchic nature. As such, Beijing has no need to bow down to international pressure and popular public opinion, since they also have the veto card in the United Nations’ Security Council. However, Manila has a few cards under its sleeve and if played wisely, might make the China issue more bearable than what it currently seems.
As an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member state, the Philippines must find methods in searching and aligning mutual interests in the ASEAN community. Manila cannot impose its wants through ASEAN because other member states treat and value their respective China relations differently. Cooperation and intensified talks with Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Hanoi can provide hints in addressing such issues, specially when considering that their relationships with Beijing are far from cordial. As a primary trading partner of Japan, which also has disputes with the People’s Republic, ensuring a shared policy of monitoring the seas is important. This is of utter importance due to the fact that Beijing’s first and second island chains include portions of Japanese and Philippine waters. Finally, as a major non-NATO ally of the United States, negotiating terms to strengthen Philippine military infrastructure is imperative since a Manila having the ability to proactively check Chinese aggressions is also a win for American diplomacy, due to Washington’s historical tendency to act as an offshore balancer.
With the next Presidential elections coming this May, Manila will have a new chief architect of foreign policy. The Duterte administration attempted to search for means to resolve these disputes but only garnered limited gains. Ideally, a more consistent yet versatile approach is needed specially because diplomacy is not a game for the feeble-minded. When Filipinos practice their right to suffrage, the electorate must look for a presidential candidate who possesses the diplomatic dexterity and finesse to employ strategic ambiguity accordingly. This territorial dispute with Beijing, which has been on the President’s table for a number of decades, has seen no favorable resolution so engaging China through diplomacy will be a battle of attrition. The future president must know when to raise the stakes, and when to de-escalate the situation. It is through Chinese relations where the Philippine president’s mettle will be rigorously tested.
Presidents Richard Nixon’s and Gerald Ford’s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and in his renowned book Diplomacy points out that military action and diplomatic recourse should come hand-to-hand lest one be witness to an undesirable outcome. Kissinger stated that Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck’s ability to balance out internal politics and foreign affairs is outstanding, as his leadership witnessed German expansion and unity in Denmark in 1864, Austria in 1866, and France in 1870. A pragmatic policy in the name of national interests must also be adopted in the Philippines, more so that a country’s internal situation greatly influences how it can play global politics. Following Mearsheimer’s second assumption in his theory of offensive realism, the country can amplify its offensive power through wealth generation, which can be achieved by empowering the economy, liberalizing the market, and continuous investment in the fields of research and development. Thus, correcting the current constitution can indirectly assist in providing better cards for Manila to play in the field of diplomacy.
However, diplomacy itself is only half of the game. Strengthening the ability of the Philippine armed forces is a national imperative if we are to keep our territorial integrity intact. Chinese encroachments will not cease anytime in the immediate future. The Chinese Coast Guard will continue to harass our fisherfolk, endangering livelihood and employment opportunities of the country. The military must possess the capability to deny and counter these provocative actions by ensuring that the Philippines has command over its seas plus the ability to demonstate credible aerial superiority. A sound military strategy combined with pragmatic diplomacy would yield a formidable national security framework. This will only come to fruition if the incoming chief architect of foreign policy and incoming commander-in-chief possesses the core competencies required to keep on top of the rigors of the presidency.",Politics
Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte set to head the most POWERFUL Philippine government since 1986,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/bongbong-marcos-and-sara-duterte-set-to-head-the-most-powerful-philippine-government-since-1986/,"The withdrawal of Senator Bong Go as presidential candidate consolidates the administration bet for leadership of the Philippine government over the next six years following the May 2022 national elections. For the first time since 1986, a majority-elected Philippine president has become a possibility if we are to consider the popularity numbers of leading candidate Bongbong Marcos. Together with his running mate Sara Duterte, the two collectively account for the lion’s share of polled voter preferences over the last 12 to 18 months. With President Rodrigo Duterte running for a Senate seat and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo a strong contender for House speakership if she succeeds in her bid for a congressional seat, Filipinos may be witness to the rise of the most powerful Philippine government yet.
The Opposition led by the Yellowtard “KakamPink” camp of “vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo are already shittin’ bricks over the coming together of a “four party alliance” that will back the Marcos-Duterte tandem. The alliance is a formidable and experienced coalition. Together, the parties that make it up had collectively catapulted three presidents to power; Arroyo, Joseph “Erap” Estrada, and Fidel Ramos. As if that were not enough to crush the spirits of the Yellowtards and their new unfriends, the communists, the administration camp have also managed to attract the support of all 44 mayors of the province of Cebu.
The key to Marcos’s success can be gleaned from what Rappler “journalist” Lian Buan was forced to admit in her piece “Marcos woos Duterte vote, gets backing of Cebu mayors” published the other day where she “reports”…
A divisive figure because of his father’s dictatorial rule marked with human rights violations and corruption, Marcos has so far stuck to a message of unification and says he shuns “gutter politics.”
Marcos had remained consistent to this tack even as other candidates — most notably Robredo herself — stuck to the tradition of mudslinging and demonisation as a means to prop up their personal brands. Marcos exhibited grace even in the face of attack from President Rodrigo Duterte himself who, at one time, referred to him as a “weak leader” and even hinted that he uses cocaine.
Robredo, for her part, in mid-November had already recognised the fatal effect on her political brand caused by overzealous bird-brained partisans. The bigotry in the Robredo camp was at such levels that many reported family ties and friendships collapsing over political differences leading Robredo to urge her followers to “initiate reconciliation, approach other people, and when you see something untrue or something that does not coincide with our beliefs, explain in a calm and respectful manner.”
“Nasaang panig ka man, gaano man kasigurado sa paninindigan mo, may nakasakit ng kapwa.  Panahon na, tayo na ang magsimula, lumapit sa mga naka-alitan, kung may nakita sa social media na hindi naaayon sa mga pinaniniwalaan natin, magpaliwanag nang mahinahon at may respeto,” Robredo said.
Politics is, indeed, addition. The Yellowtards are learning their lessons too late and instituting too little reforms within their ranks. Their embedded culture of Martial Law Crybabyism, fear-mongering over the fantasy of a “return to authoritartianism”, and a stubborn parroting of elitist concepts like “human rights” and “gender equality” that are irrelevant — even alien — to the average Filipino had really done them in. As a result, they have ended up even more disunited now than they were just a few months back when an early attempt at an Opposition coalition dubbed “1Sambayan” sought to elevate one single unifying Opposition candidate to go up against the administration camp. Meanwhile, the administration camp has achieved all of that and more — a single presidential candidate and a slate of Senate and House candidates that will likely mobilise the backing of both chambers of Congress around the coming Second Marcos Administration.
What now for the Opposition? I wrote just this morning that in the face of imminent defeat, they will need to change their mindset from an aggressive regard for a “winnable” battle to one where mitigation of impending losses is paramount. The Yellowtards need to let go of the delusional strategy they currently apply to their campaign where members within their comfy echo chambers assure one another of the righteousness of their “cause” (and, therefore, their entitlement to victory) and adopt more of a strategic retreat mindset. It is either that or they lose big in May 2022 — i.e., not just suffer a catastrophic loss of face and obliterate what remains of their political capital but also drag down with them the fortunes of the oligarchs who continue to foolishly bankroll their “cause” and stake the futures of their family enterprises on a Yellowtard return to power.
The most powerful government in recent Philippine history is coming. People will need to decide amongst themselves which side of the equation they would like to see themselves situated over the foreseeable future. It starts with your own social media accounts. As the eminent communist “activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago observed, “after I removed myself from the Leni campaign groups, my newsfeed on FB has ceased to be pink. I took only about 10 days for that algorithm to change, and it’s an important thing to consider whenever you think, or imagine, that the numbers on our side are growing, or that there is ‘public clamor’ for anything at all. Know that algorithms make us think that, for a reason.”",Politics
Bongbong Marcos banned from travel to the United States and Switzerland: What this means for Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/bongbong-marcos-banned-from-travel-to-the-united-states-and-switzerland-what-this-means-for-filipinos/,"Members of the Opposition Yellowtard bloc are making it look like presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos’s being banned from setting foot on the soil of the Philippines’ former colonial master is a bad thing. It could be because of their recent falling out with the communists and, now as a result, are opposed to the single biggest pillar of the latter’s “activism” — the fantastical idea that every Filipino president is a tuta (lapdog) of the United States.
To remain consistent to their moronic ideology then, the communists should be throwing their support behind the first evah Philippine president who will be leading a government that will, out of necessity, have to operate outside of America’s sphere of influence. A Marcos presidency should therefore be regarded as a gift to Philippine communism. Shortly after President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in 2016, Joma Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), reportedly said in “online interviews” that “[if] deemed necessary by the revolutionary movement, I will return to the Philippines to fight the Duterte puppet regime of US imperialism”. Indeed, communist “activism” has remained consistent to this ululation since time immemorial.
The Philippines has long been the United States’ Mini Me. It is a quaint legacy of American aspirations to create a beacon of democracy in the region to assure a world fearful of the communist onslaught that at least one southeast Asian domino will remain standing as the others (as the thinking at the time went) fell.
Filipinos of a certain generation — particularly that of Sison’s himself — continue to cling to the obsolete notion that their duty as a people lies in upholding that mission to be instrumental to the containment of any threat to America’s hegemony in the region. This is a notion Sison and his communist henchmen have been battling for decades; to the extent of perpetrating terrorist activities in the countryside through its terror arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). Still, beyond the perverse ideology Sison and his ilk espouse, many traditional Filipino politicians have long demonstrated a cockiness that far exceeds their country’s ability to stand on its own two feet both economically and militarily. Recall in the early 1990s how twelve senators duly elected by the popular vote (and as such presumably representing the Filipino people’s “will”) voted to boot the American Military out of Philippine shores…
Thanks to the 12 bozos who voted against US military bases in the Philippines in 1991 — Senate President Jovito Salonga, Sens. Wigberto Tanada, Teofisto Guingona, Rene Saguisag, Victor Ziga, Sotero Laurel, Ernesto Maceda, Agapito Aquino, Juan Ponce Enrile, Joseph Estrada, Orlando Mercado, and Aquilino Pimentel — Filipinos have, right in their faces today, a sad lesson twenty years in the making in what it is like to languish outside the American sphere of what is globally relevant.
Well herein now, by all accounts, is presented a candidate in Marcos Jr. who, whether he himself likes it or not, promises to slam the door on any further “imperialism” the United States presumes to effect on its former “brown brothers” in the Far East. What then of the old Cold War rheroric of the CPP-NPA? The other day, Inquirer columnist Ma. Ceres P. Doyo issued a veiled threat writing that “[a] Marcos win will fuel the armed insurgency. 1980s redux, a déjà vu.” That will be an interesting circus to behold indeed specially the part where these commies engineer further convolution into their propaganda in their continued lame attempts to navigate the landscape of inconsistencies they’ve laid before their “cause”.",Politics
Disqualifying Bongbong Marcos will make him the president Filipinos were DEPRIVED of by the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/disqualifying-bongbong-marcos-will-make-him-the-president-filipinos-were-deprived-of-by-the-yellowtards/,"Do the Opposition really think that removing Bongbong Marcos from the presidential race will actually solve their problems? Perhaps they need to ask themselves a simple question: Is Bongbong Marcos the cause of their dismal performance at the polls? The answer to that question seems to be one that the Opposition — specifically the leading Yellowtard bloc within it — don’t want to confront.
Let’s say for argument’s sake that the Yellowtards succeed in their petition to disqualify Marcos or have his Certificate of Candidacy revoked and Leni Robredo gets elected president. And then what? It is likely that over much of her six-year term, Robredo and her party will be derided as the people who deprived Filipino voters of the man who should have been president. How then could she possibly govern with that hanging over her head specially so that she is already widely-regarded as someone who earlier had cheated the same man out of the vice presidency?
It is clear from poll after poll that Bongbong Marcos enjoys the mandate of his people. A big proportion of the electorate plan to vote for him and they do so knowing who his father is and what his father is said to have done. How could they not know? The Yellowtards have been drumming the narrative of Marcos the Dictator into Filipinos’ heads over more than 30 years!
If the Yellowtards aspire to validate their place in Philippine history, then they must be willing to face Marcos in the battlefield to earn that place. The trouble with the lot of them is that earning that place is all but an alien notion because they see themselves as entitled to victory on the basis of their self-appointed goodness in a battle they framed as one fought between “good” and “evil”. Why earn something that was mine to begin with? That there is the sort of thinking the Yellowtards apply to their campaign.
Will a Second Marcos Presidency be the “death” of Philippine democracy as the Yellowtards warn us it will be? The Yellowtards say it is so because any system that does not yield a result favourable to them must be broken. Filipinos deserve better than this sort of Crybaby Opposition. The only thing that will die if and when Bongbong Marcos becomes President of the Philippines is Yellowtardism and that will be a true cause for celebration for a people who deserve better than to be regarded as mere victims for another six years.",Politics
Leni Robredo is anything but a “healing leader”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredo-is-anything-but-a-healing-leader/,"Leni Robredo today issued a statement asserting that she regards herself as a “healing leader”. Exactly what this means is anyone’s guess but what seems to escape the blinkered minds of her supporters is how it was really her Yellowtard lot who drove through the wedge that today deeply-divides Philippine society.
The divisiveness the Yellowtard “cause” is manifested in their habitual use of colours to define their exclusive community of “woke” partisans. A political colour is meant to invoke exclusive tribalism rather than come across as a call to be inclusive. One feels this when seeing the pompous and self-righteous manner with which members of Robredo’s mob signal their party affiliations by bathing their campaign events and social media paraphernalia in pink today. Indeed, the use of this new pink branding seems to actually have the unintended effect of highlighting even more their lame attempt to distance themselves from their Yellowtard roots.
It is worth noting too that former President Noynoy Aquino himself spent the bigger part of his term identifying himself with the Yellowtard brand. He showed his being a Yellowtard first and a Filipino a distant second whenever he made public appearances sporting a yellow ribbon pinned to his shirt or suit. This made it easy for then rising candidate Rodrigo Duterte to demonstrate his loyalty to all Filipinos first — by using the national colours to define his campaign.
Evidently not having learnt enough from that loss in 2016 and then again in 2019 when the entire Yellowtard “Otso Diretso” coalition endorsed by no less than Robredo herself was wiped out at the polls, the Opposition have latched on to this very same campaign style. The same coloured stunts and spectacles, the same self-righteous campaign style, and the same negative rhetoric is on exhibit. It seems the Yellowtards are really not serious about winning the 2022 elections. How could they be when they’ve chosen a loser politician like Leni Robredo to lead them?
What is it exactly that Leni Robredo plans to achieve if given the chance to lead the country from 2022? If Robredo and her lot cannot even change their campaign style what makes them think they would know the first thing about mounting an effort to implement long overdue change in the Philippines? Robredo cannot even seem to make a basic promise to make the Philippines a better place if given the chance to serve as its president. A “healing leader” she now tells us? What results does that drivel even imply? What does success even look like following a Robredo presidency? The mystery persists.",Politics
An unconventional proposal to save all versions of Filipino democracy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/an-unconventional-proposal-to-save-all-versions-of-filipino-democracy/,"For anyone who has been observing the Philippine political scene long enough, it is not hard to come to the conclusion that regardless of who wins the presidential election, Filipinos will remain the same mediocre, divided, and self-interested collection of disjoint tribes that they’ve always been. The term of Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino was marked by an inability of mainstream media to keep up with successfully covering up its deficiencies and obvious gaffes. The current term of president Rodrigo Duterte is poised to end unable to live up to its full potential of “change” – in no small part because the elites of Imperial Manila did their utmost to obstruct it.
Whichever side you stand on the political fence, Filipinos have in common that they see their politicians as sort of godfathers, mga ninong, who shower them with gifts and favors before, during, and after the elections. Self-interest is a great motivation; the rich want “concessions” and influence that will make them richer, while the poor want the freebies that will get them thru every single day without damaging the “budget”.
The “decent” crowd – now AKA the Pinklawans, Pinktards, Pinkoloids, anything but Yellowtards – are clinging to their choice of Leni Robredo for president – buy, buy, MUST WIN – in order to salvage whatever is left of their clout and precious collective political ego. On social media platforms, despite having the weight of conveniently-placed assets to silence opinions they don’t agree with, they have been largely unsuccessful in totally cancelling out the DDS – the Diehard Duterte Supporters – and continue to be met with a ferocity that has led them to cry “our dissent is being silenced”, when all they mean to say is that, they’ve been so used to the privilege of having the last word on things that the loss of it feels like oppression. What complicates things for the Pinkoloids are the supporters – long-time or recent – of the Marcoses, particularly the presidential aspirant Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., who have ridden the momentum of the sliding irrelevance of the Liberal Party (LP) to come out in a “safer space”.
On the other side of the track, the DDS may have the numbers – or so the surveys say – but they have little socio-political weight even after five years of being the dominant force. They lack a large-scale communications infrastructure, which is why Duterte, his administration, and his supporters are left at the mercy of mainstream media to be misrepresented, and their words twisted, to give unwitting audiences the impression that things in the Philippines are worse than they actually are. It is still also more socially accepted in certain areas of the country to cancel/ostracize DDS in real life; by the virtue of “whom you’re connected to”, Duterte’s offensiveness will carry over to you as a supporter. Duterte’s supporters may not have the snooty air or the inability to step out of their echo chambers that the “disente” do, but they turn off the non-aligned just the same by being irrationally hostile towards any criticism of Tatay Digong, especially the warranted ones.
Suffice to say, both the LP’s supporters and the DDS most likely overestimate the number of live bodies they have on their side. When we focus on the presidential election next year, however, the mood this early indicates that Bongbong Marcos, or Sara Duterte if she decides to be a substitute, will win, and that Leni Robredo and any remnants of the LP will lose – if the Liberal Party competes fair and square. – a big if. Duterte and Marcos supporters, on the other hand, assume that people will fall into line and forget all the offensiveness associated with their candidates when they win.
Robredo’s win in the vice-president elections last 2016 remains unconvincing for a portion of the electorate. On the other hand, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has been perceived for quite some time as too lenient on the skullduggery of the Liberal Party; the DDS and Marcos supporters may just find out the hard way, again, that, more than the votes, it’s who counts the votes that count. Regardless of who wins this election, certain bad blood (sama ng loob) will remain unresolved, and Filipinos will still be divided. The social conditions will result in a stalemate where everybody loses.
I believe, however, that the DDS and the Pinklawans can actually reach a compromise. Hence the following proposal.
As previously mentioned, in a fair fight Leni Robredo will most likely lose; Duterte and Marcos supporters, against all odds, will not allow a repeat of 2016 to happen. The agreement they can reach is that the Pinklawans get to keep their deluded self-righteousness and “entitlement” to label their political enemies all manners of “stupid”, but in return, they forfeit the election immediately, and all privilege to comment on politics in any medium they share with their political enemies. To extend this proposal even further, the Lenitards can have their own, Liberal Party-dominant piece of land, consider themselves seceded from the bigger Republic of the Philippines, and run it according to their own inoffensive, West-friendly principles/ideology. The rest of the Philippines will be run according to the vision of a Duterte-Marcos “dream team” that their supporters have. A “friendly” competition can even be staged to see who has developed the farthest after a certain number of years!
What happens to those who identify neither as Pinktards, or DDS? Sorry, Filipinos have already decided your side for you; if you criticize Leni, you’re a Dutertard. If you criticize Digong or Bongbong, you’re a Yellowtard. It’s up to you where you want to be lumped.
Go forward with Duterte, or stew in the past with the Liberal Party – Filipinos leave themselves little choice.
Filipinos have demonstrated time and again that they excel when they’re apart, rather than when they work together. It’s a win-win deal.
Your move, Philippines.

Corrupted Values on Vote-buying,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/corrupted-values-vote-buying/,"Presidential aspirant Leni Robredo and Bishop Socrates Villegas have gone on record as saying that voters should take vote-buying bribes offered to them despite going on to vote a different candidate later on. The late Jaime Cardinal Sin had also said the same thing before.
I hope that people with a true sense of decency also have the common sense to see the ridiculousness in this.
Supporters of the above-mentioned people will argue, but voters will do that anyway! That’s practical! Why condemn such an act? Let them do it!
But in both true Christian and secular values, that act is dishonest.
First, why take the bribe at all? When you take the bribe, you signify a promise to vote for the candidate. Denying this is a foolish exercise of illogic. And isn’t accepting bribes wrong at all? Perhaps the people above don’t realize that what they’ll do will have an effect of sanitizing all other forms of bribery.
Second, if you take the bribe and vote for someone else anyway, isn’t that lying? So not only do you take bribes, but you lie.
The right answer would be to never take the bribe at all.
I wonder if the politician and church people mentioned here are thinking that any way to give to the poor should be acceptable, even if the means used is sinful by their own standards. Basically, the end justifies the means for them, with the willingness to make compromises to their values. If they do, that would be rightly identified as hypocrisy.
I find it both appalling and amusing that Catholic religious authorities (though I believe there are others who are actually facepalming) are encouraging corrupted values. Either those religious authorities are confused about their own values or, as some articles on this blog and many others have said, are willing to twist their own values in support of their own agenda, which the Catholic Church after all has done in its long history. Or both.
This makes me even more glad to have embraced “Protestantism” a long time ago.",Politics
"Andy Bautista, a Yellowtard, was COMELEC chief during the 2016 elections. Why was there no “public vetting” then?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/andy-bautista-a-yellowtard-was-comelec-chief-during-the-2016-elections-why-was-there-no-public-vetting-then/,"The Opposition are shittin’ bricks over the implications of President Rodrigo Duterte being in a position to appoint people to the Commission on Elections en banc in February next year. Retiring by then are Chairman Sheriff Abas and Commissioners Rowena Guanzon and Antonio Kho Jr. and, in addition to those, there is one vacant position. Such is the chilling effect of all this on the Opposition — specially the “leading” bloc within it, the Yellowtards — that they are now calling for a “public vetting” of these appointments. This call for is unconstitutional because the Constitution already provides for duly-elected representatives to do that job.
SECTION 18. There shall be a Commission on Appointments consisting of the President of the Senate, as ex officio Chairman, twelve Senators and twelve Members of the House of Representatives, elected by each House on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The Chairman of the Commission shall not vote, except in case of a tie. The Commission shall act on all appointments submitted to it within thirty session days of the Congress from their submission. The Commission shall rule by a majority vote of all the Members.
More important to note, however, is that back in the lead up to the 2016 elections, President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III and his cabal of Yellowtards were in power and guess who served as no less than COMELEC Chairman at the time — Andy Bautista. Bautista is clearly a lackey of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan. Upon his ascent to power in 2010, Aquino appointed him Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) — an agency created in 1986 by Aquino’s mother and then President Cory Aquino to hunt down cronies of “deposed” President Ferdinand Marcos.
While it is clear that Bautista was a trusted lieutenant of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan during his stint as COMELEC chief, evidence of his big personal stake in the success of the Liberal Party goes even further back. According to current Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin, Bautista was also involved in Mar Roxas’s senatorial campaign as an “adviser”.
Bautista was also beset by allegations of being in possession of “ill-gotten-wealth” which many suspect could have been acquired as PCGG chief and possibly as COMELEC chair.
Patricia Bautista, the estranged wife of the Chairman of the Commission on Elections Andres Bautista, has submitted an affidavit disclosing evidence against the COMELEC chief that he has a total estimated value of almost P1 billion in money in banks, properties, interest and shares in companies established overseas that he did not declare in his 2016 Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN).
Again, this is just another case of the selective “activism” of the Opposition who have nothing much to work with as far as a strategic vision for the Philippines beyond their traditional negative campaigning style. Like the way an empty drum makes a lot of noise and bounces up and down as it rolls down a hill, the Yellowtards are in the midst of a tililing rampage — randomly flailing over every morsel to feed their Martial Law Crybabyism and lashing out at any perceived slight against their latest hero-saint Leni Robredo. Truly a dishonest lot that one can only imagine would further set the Philippines back should they ascend power at any time in the future.",Politics
The Cult of Leni Robredo: Are its members RABID enough to deliver a win for her?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/the-cult-of-leni-robredo-are-its-members-rabid-enough-to-deliver-a-win-for-her/,"Here goes Manuel L. Quezon III again with his metaphors. In his Inquirer piece today “The voodoo rebellion”, he makes it appear that the Duterte-Marcos alliance is a cult.
In recent weeks, Lakas-CMD, and then PDP-Laban, seem to have lost faith in this Second Coming. But the faithful stand firm. A stampita of the faithful consists of an infographic circulating online: the “Sara All Philippines 2022 Caravan” is supposed to kick off tomorrow in Cotobato City, arriving in Manila on Nov. 13, and culminating on the 15th, “The Big Day.” It has all the characteristics of folk religion, and I find it striking that all the fervor is being matched by the fervor in another cultic camp, that of the Marcoses. Except in their case, the Marcos creed can be best described as a hybrid of data science and cargo cult.
Think again, Manolo. It is actually the Yellow camp — spray-painted in pink today — which is the real cult. Just look at the vocabulary this mob has spawned; Kakampinks and all that comes with it. Then you have Leni Robredo taking the role of the goddess who preaches the Pink catechism to the faithful. Have you seen her video about her upcoming announcement about her “solution” to the pandemic? Pandemic mind you. This, even if she’s not a member of any task force under the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) as her office has been functioning independent of the Republic since she assumed office but still dependent on public funds.
The administration is disorganized because the power blocs supporting the President are all jockeying for position. It can’t be said that the Opposition is “solid” either. Even with the unconditional support of leftist-militant groups, Robredo still doesn’t stand a chance of winning the Presidency. Why? Ask the average Pinoy if he’s decided on who to vote for and chances are he won’t give a firm answer. Ask kung sino ang napipisil niya and that’s the only time he will give you a list of his choices. Robredo’s support comes mostly from the “ABC” demographic but that’s not enough to win it and Andy Bautista isn’t around to do his magic for her. There’s also the matter of the increasing percentage of undecideds. 8.6% for the Presidential race and 16.9% for the VP race. These are high and may still increase.
The truth is the greater majority of Pinoys will make their decision after the debates. This is when the real race begins. It will come down to a race between Ping Lacson and Bongbong Marcos (BBM). Even if either of the two Dutertes run as BBMs VP, it won’t be a coronation in May. Why? If as early as now, a petition for disqualification has been filed against BBM, I wouldn’t put it past any of the other candidates to be asked to withdraw by their backers and consolidate behind Sen. Lacson. The goal is to prevent a Marcos Presidency at all cost. A lot can still happen between now and May 2022. It’s not over until the winner is proclaimed.",Politics
"People, not just cars: Bongbong Marcos’s peoplecades beat Leni Robredo’s motorcades any day!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/people-not-just-cars-bongbong-marcoss-peoplecades-beat-leni-robredos-motorcades-any-day/,"Cars don’t elect presidents. People do. That is perhaps the big lesson members of Leni Robredo’s camp have been learning over the past week. It seemed at first that Robredo’s #KakamPink titas enjoyed a big head start with their chi chi motorcade of, well, motor cars snaking their way through various hinterland roads. One of these circuses claimed 4000 to 5000 such vehicles being jammed into a scenic road in Bicol just to display the pinkness of the movement — a stunt (if the numbers are true) that most likely will have disrupted the day’s vital traffic of goods and services in and out of town.
Weeks of pink motorcades given preferential mileage by Big Corporate Media, likely lulled the Yellowtard “thought leaders” into false senses of accomplishment — not surprising considering that they rely on their own choir for validation preferring to ignore cold facts from third parties. Last week didn’t end quite well for the Yellowtards, or rather this week didn’t see them off to a happy start on account of scenes of a vast sea of people — not cars — from a rival camp emerging and making waves all over media at the crack of dawn Sunday morning.
There was also an aerial photo, making it quite evident that this was an activity participated in by actual people.
Compare the human density exhibited in the above Ilocos Sur activity and the nature of the vehicles used. Clearly, the numbers were representative as were the vehicles — most ordinary Filipinos get around in motorbikes and not those big pickup trucks and SUVs used by the Yellowtards.
Motorbikes make it real because they represent a practical asset to the average Filipino. Case in point in how the Yellowtards just don’t get it and, as a result, come across as sad elitists is in this ill-thought-out notion of a “Skaters for Leni” group. Skates aren’t really something most Filipinos can relate with nowadays…
… specially when considering that most Filipinos have to contend with paved areas that aren’t as smooth as the top-notch bitumen that seal the streets of chi chi Bonifacio Global City and the like.
Seriously, it seems these Yellowtard motorcades may be having the unintended effect of highlighting even more the huge disconnect from the very people they are trying to reach that an increasingly desperate Opposition may be suffering. Perhaps the Opposition need to be reminded that campaigns are meant to convert voters, not marginalise them. Key is in the signalling and messaging. The Opposition clearly do not hold that key.",Politics

It seems that the only thing she’s taken a stand on is, get this, the COVID-19 pandemic. And why not, right? What human on the face of this planet is not concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic? For two years, we were all subject to it and the measures our government’s implemented on a trial-and-error basis to contain it and mitigate its social and economic impacts.
So what does a party and its desperate presidential bet Leni Robredo do when pressed to come up with a platform and strategic vision for the country? Why, come up with a “COVID Strategy” of course!
But of course. It makes perfect sense. As the next president of the country, you just have to have a COVID Strategy, right? And as to what this strategy aims to achieve?

Freedom from worry over getting sick
Public health first
Itigil ang kurapsyon (Stop corruption!)
Itigil ang anumalya (Stop anomalies!)
Competent COVID response leadership
Support for frontliners
Good pay for frontliners
Support for hospitals
– So that when you get sick, you don’t need to worry.
Free and accessible health care
Free consultation using technology
Each Barangay fully equipped and has its own nurse
Give them all that they need to do their job
Fix PhilHealth
Fast claims processing
Vaccines for all
Government to make it easy to deliver vaccines
Freedom from hunger
Filipinos are worried about where to get food for their children
Whenever there is a lockdown, provide immediate ayuda.
Stop large scale lockdowns
Lockdowns should be “targeted”
Support small businesses
Provide financial support to small businesses so they don’t need to layoff workers
Implement unemployment insurance so that people who lose jobs get help from the government
Strengthen agriculture and fishing sectors
Provide enough support to strengthen the livelihoods of fishermen and farmers
Ensure that every Filipino has food
Freedom from lack of education
For low risk areas, start opening schools
For high risk areas, give gadgets and “load” to each student
Increase the number of community learning hubs
Provide Internet access for education purposes

Clearly, with all the dramatics stripped off, all one is really left with is the above transcript of her salient points — basically all motherhood statements that make one think, arent’t we all glad Leni Robredo is here to tell us these things. Considering that Robredo enjoys the benefit of two years of being a miron (observer) to the world’s leaders dealing with what, during their times at the top, had been all unprecedented, the above is all she, her top “thought leaders”, and expensive campaign strategists could come up with.
Stepping back even further one ought to ask this aspiring president: is it really just all about COVID? Looking at the pained look on her face in the video, it becomes evident that this is about everything the energy she would bring to her proposed presidency can cope with. What Filipinos will be subject to once again, if Robredo had her way, will be a government obssessed with “the poor”. Never mind that the future of the Philippines hangs on the quiet achievement of its most promising citizens — the ones who possess the skills, capital, and motivation to invent that longer-lasting lightbulb and develop processes that yield more for less input. It does not lie in people who are burdens to society, are public funds sinkholes, don’t pay income tax, and feel entitled to help from the “more fortunate”.
The fact is COVID is just another one of those things people will have to live with. It can’t be an emergency forever — and certainly not one of those “emergencies” that an administration bereft of any forward-looking strategy relies on for relevance. Many Filipinos, for example, lack running water, indoor plumbing, and access to safe and efficient transportation. All that’s been going on for decades. But are those things treated like some sort of ongoing crisis? Not really. “The poor” are happy to elect the same public officials who had long maintained those status quos. So who cares, right? Their vote, their accountability. What makes COVID any different? It’ll just be another one of those day-to-day risks in the Philippines that the poor are at a disadvantage to mitigate but are at the bottom of the List of Things to Worry About of the rich and promising. That’s the status quo.
Want to change that status quo? Having a COVID-19 “Strategy” will not do that for you — specially one that is full of all the Whats-to-Dos that lend well to media sound bytes and campaign slogans and utterly thin on the How-Tos. To change the status quo, a leader needs to be transformational — not one whose entire campaign platform rests on shrill reactiveness.",Politics
Less than 5 months to campaign and Leni Robredo STILL lacks a vision for the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/less-than-5-months-to-campaign-and-leni-robredo-still-lacks-a-vision-for-the-philippines/,"So most people are back to work now. There’s an election coming up in less than five months and a new highly-contagious variant of the COVID virus to face. Everyone is doing their job to face these and the rest of life’s challenges — everyone, perhaps, except the esteemed honchos of Opposition campaign teams. The challenge is simple: make Leni Robredo popular. So, what now? Opposition “thought leaders” continue to look to the past for answers to the big question: What more can we do to make Leni a winner?
At this point in the campaign, candidates should already have firmed their messaging and defined the field on which the battle for voters’ hearts and minds will be fought. For Robredo and her Yellowtards, their choice of battlefield is the one where they believe Filipinos remain torn between “democracy” and “authoritarianism”. The Yellowtards think that they are still in the midst of a “fight” for democracy and they want Filipinos to join this fight lest they lose the “freedoms” that had been “won” from the clutches of the “evil dictator” in 1986. In short, Robredo does not have a vision for the Philippines. Her rhetoric is a stunted one that involves keeping Filipinos believing that they are victims and that she and her lot are their rescuers.
The Philippines is, in fact, a maturing democratic country. This year will see the seventh presidential election since that “revolution” in 1986. Based on what several reputable polling firms are reporting, the outcome of this year’s election may be the first majority-elected president under the current 1987  Constitution. If Robredo claim to be rescuing Filipinos from some sort of tyrant, this is a “tyrant” a majority of Filipinos is likely to choose. Robredo and her ilk are, in effect, claiming that choosing a “tyrant” that they themselves had labelled as such is “bad”. Unfortunately for them, democracy does not judge the goodness or badness of election candidates — only how many votes they attract.
Why has Robredo so far failed in her efforts to become more popular than leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos? Ask a typical Yellowtard and she will tell you it is because Marcos was a beneficiary of “fake news”, “disinformation”, and “historical revisionism” perpetrated over decades since 1986. First of all, that is their opinion try as hard as they can to make it sound like a statement of fact. Second, that answer still does not explain why Robredo remains unpopular. The fact that the Yellowtards prefer to regard the contest for people’s votes through the lens of the first and fail to reflect on the confronting truth of the second goes some way towards explaining why their campaign is a failure.
The most probable explanation is that Filipinos can tell whether a candidate is the real deal or not. Authenticity is a very subtle virtue that clients pay PR consultants, marketers, and advertisers millions to nail. Consumers, on the other hand, rely on their gut. Evidently, the guts of the more than 50 percent of Filipinos polled over the last year or two tell them something good about Marcos. The Yellowtards have since been mounting an ineffectual campaign to discredit those guts. It’s a flawed strategy formulated by arrogant pretenders. True professionals in the fields of mass persuasion spend their energies understanding those guts and not dismissing them.
What next for the Yellowtards now that more than enough metrics have proven the folly of their chosen campaign approach? Easy. Their strategy needs to be reformed. As the venerable Albert Einstein once pointed out, you can’t solve a problem using the same thinking that created it. Robredo should fire her campaign team.",Politics
"With options fast running out, are the Yellowtards exploring ILLEGAL means to seize power?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/with-options-fast-running-out-are-the-yellowtards-exploring-illegal-means-to-seize-power/,"Survey after survey conducted by and reported on by reputable polling firms continue to show that the Yellowtards led by Leni Robredo are “fighting” a losing battle. They are not gaining any ground and, with every word that comes out of Robredo’s mouth, are attracting ridicule as internal contradictions and inconsistencies in their ideology and messaging come to light. Still, the Yellowtards deserve credit for their fighting spirit although this manifests itself more in their continuing the same practices, applying the same thinking, and schmoozing with the same players that stunted their campaign to begin with.
Indeed, the extent of their delusion is mind boggling. Just the other day, Ben Bernabe, communications head of Robredo’s campaign team, issued a tweet calling for administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos to withdraw from the race. According to Bernabe, Marcos is “the single most divisive person in Philippine politics today” which is a strange thing to say considering Marcos has consistently attracted preference ratings north of 50 percent in these polls conducted over the last several months.
It leads one to wonder what sort of logic Bernabe applied to arriving at this assertion considering that, between the two rivals, it is Robredo who so far fails to unite a credible Opposition force against an opponent that clearly could not be beaten by the fragmented one we see today.
The only other explanation for the baffling optimism the Opposition manage to sustain in the face of increasingly insurmountable odds is that they could be exploring options to acquire political power outside of the frame of these elections. This is not entirely implausible considering the Yellowtards’ track record of overusing their hopelessly perverted “people power” narrative to justify any crooked means they might apply to achieving their goals. The Yellowtards believe in the notion that the “people’s will” trumps all else but fail to understand that a mature democracy channels that “will” through institutionalised processes — such as elections. For the Yellowtards, a street “revolution” backed by a military coup d’etat is an acceptable means to change leadership. Worse, they have also exhibited an ability to emotionally-blackmail the judiciary into legitimising whoever emerges as the “revolutionary” leader following that. This was the modus operandi they applied both in 1986 and 2001 when Cory Aquino and Gloria Arroyo respectively were “sworn in” by Supreme Court justices following such coups.
To be fair, it is unlikely that the Yellowtards would be able to pull similar stunts nowadays. If waning interest in commemorating the anniversaries of the 1986 EDSA “Revolution” over the last several years are any indication, any attempt to use “people power” to usurp these or future elections will likely fall flat on their faces. Then again, a Marcos coming back to power is a big deal for the Yellowtards and their allies in the Liberal West as it will result in a colossal loss of face for them. Thus, as many political observers are wont to caution those who are tempted to rest on the laurels that are Marcos’s stellar polling outcomes, anything can still happen.",Politics
Leaked report commissioned by Leni Robredo camp reveals extent of her campaign team’s INCOMPETENCE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/leaked-report-commissioned-by-leni-robredo-camp-reveals-extent-of-her-campaign-teams-incompetence/,"Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao shared in a Facebook post yesterday what he later writes in his column today “Isko, Leni studies confirm Marcos Jr. is way ahead” is a report on a focus group study commissioned by the campaign team of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo.

(1) To understand [the] journey on how and why they [came to] support Ferdinand Marcos Jr. (BBM)
(2) To see what arguments could possibly diminish or erase their support for BBM
(3) To test their openness to supporting Vice-President Leni Robredo
The insights gleaned by the researchers paint an unsurprising picture of what Robredo’s campaign strategists are up against in terms of changing perceptions — both of Marcos and of Robredo — among Marcos’s supporters and crafting a way forward to achieve this. The following slides from the report summarises key terms used by focus group participants that were noted by researchers.
Most notable are the negative terms associated with Robredo that are clear indictments of the dysfunctional messaging that characterised her campaign over the last six to eight months and the PR stunts she engaged in over the five years of her term as “vice president”. Her “Lugaw Leni” persona which was one of her longest-running brand awareness campaigns (launched during her “response” to the Taal volcano eruption in early 2020) evidently did the most damage. Amazingly, this piece of collateral persisted into her current “KakamPink” campaign where serving lugaw (rice porridge) to supporters remains a cornerstone activity of her sorties.
Coming in second in the list of failed Robredo personal brand development initiatives is her legacy as a minion — no, leader — of the utterly-discredited Liberal Party of the Philippines. Robredo ran as the LP vice presidential candidate in 2016 and, also under the LP flag, endorsed the ill-fated Otso Diretso senatorial coalition in 2019. Despite sad efforts at  recolouring her brand to the Pink of her campaign today, Robredo remains, at her core, a Yellowtard.
Third and final is very likely the single most damaging stunt of all due to the size of the destruction it wreaked on her campaign over a relatively short time frame (compared to the damage cause by the first two that is was spread over years). This medal of infamy in the annals of the PR profession belongs to Robredo’s astoundingly crude hadouken TikTok video.
We wrote back then amidst the fallout in the aftermath of this catastrophic stunt…
Some Yellowtard partisans and “activists” expressed dismay over how these stunts may actually be setting back the “cause” and bringing across the wrong message to voters whose preferences they seek to convert to their camp.
The research shows that the majority of the work the Yellowtards need to do over the remaining campaign period is to undo and correct the damage caused by their own work. Can they do this in the less than five months before Election Day? The report provides some food for thought on the way forward…
• While people feel [Bongbong Marcos] is as brilliant as his father, it is not actually the case
• If there is a need to harp on martial law, it should come from someone credible and who experienced it firsthand
• [Leni Robredo] might need to refrain from voicing her opinion against BBM as it only makes him more ‘kawawa’ and gain public sympathy
Nonetheless, the researchers go on to spell out some “viable methods to attack BBM”.
Given that they now have a treasure trove of “research” on how to beat Bongbong Marcos the steps they will take next and the shrill internal conversations that will erupt within Yellowtard echo chambers will be an interesting show to sit back and watch over a couple of beers. Can the girlettes and manlets of Team Leni Robredo read the map spread right before them? Can they even read maps in general? Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Politics
Jessica Soho’s interview of Opposition presidential candidates unlikely to change the course of the elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/jessica-sohos-interview-of-opposition-presidential-candidates-unlikely-to-change-the-course-of-the-elections/,"Who is Jessica Soho anyway? Yellowtards say she is a “multi-awarded” television “journalist”. But then so is Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. Indeed, the latter sports no less than the Nobel “Peace Prize” for being God’s Gift to World “Journalism” last year. That just about trumps anything Soho’s got. And yet, Ressa herself for all the support she and her Rapplerettes extend to the “cause” of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo has delivered zero results as far as the latter’s winnability.
One wonders then what Yellowtard influencers and “activists” are crowing about. The fact is, Bongbong Marcos succeeded at knocking the wind out of what was supposed to be another media coup for the Opposition. The Jessica Soho Show ended up being no more than a lame exhibit of unprecedented political mediocrity. Such a sad cast of characters — a pale reboot of Cory Aquino’s “sacrificial widow” act, a disgraced homophobic boxing champ, a That’s Entertainment alumnus, and Senator Doorknob himself. It’s no wonder the Yellowtards are hopping mad. They were deprived of their entitlement to a Marcos lynching Friday night.
With less than four months of campaign time to go, it gets more and more difficult for the Opposition to be hopeful. All the Yellowtards are doing is upping the volume and frequency of their “Laban Leni” (“fight Leni”) cries. Putting more effort on a failed approach may not exactly be the smartest way forward at this point, but what are the alternatives? Petitioning Marcos’s disqualification from the elections and cancellation of his candidacy had been tried. Demonising him, calling out his father’s “tyranny”, and accusing him of being a thief had become a decades-long tradition. Conspiring with Big Corporate Media to deplatform him only forced Marcos to build a formidable social media machine and amass a vlogging audience on YouTube. Now, a stunt aimed to re-platform him on a GMA Network show hosted by Soho seems to have failed to put even a small dent on his political brand equity.
Unfortunately for the Opposition candidates, the bigger objective here is not to compete with one another for second place. The objective is to present a credible challenge to Marcos. Putting Soho up on a pedestal benefits no one in their lot because Soho had failed to draw Marcos within scope of the Opposition’s arsenal. The only real way to win the presidency is to beat Marcos and it is when one starts to seriously consider this confronting reality that the individuality of each Opposition presidential candidate begins to become irrelevant. Ultimately it is Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte versus all the rest. There is no Leni, no Isko, no Pacman, no Ping. There is only The Opposition versus the Marcos-Duterte tandem.
In short, even this late into the campaign, the idea that only a united opposition can win the day for those who seek to prevent the Second Marcos Presidency looming in the horizon remains a powerful call. The irony here is that to prevent another Marcos presidency, the Opposition need to remove Marcos from their rhetoric and come up with a forward looking platform premised on Marcos being out of the picture. That alone is a near impossibility seeing that Martial Law Crybabyism is woven into the threads that form the very ideological fiber of the Opposition’s leading partisan blocs — the Yellowtards and the communists. Even if, by some miracle, they pull a rabbit out of a hat and come up with a brilliant no-Marcos-included narrative, getting a good number of Filipinos onboard the narrative — which means pulling a big number of them out of Marcos’s gravitational pull — will be an enormous feat of campaign engineering.
What can the Opposition do differently over the next three-plus months to give some basis for hope that an outcome different to where this election is currently headed can be achieved? This is the part where Opposition leaders and their supporters need to start applying a bit of intelligence and originality to their political craft. The challenge is clear. Come up with something that breaks ground and changes minds. It’s simple, really. Trying to solve a problem using the same thinking that created it is borderline insanity. Time for some sober thinking, people of the Opposition!",Politics
Bongbong Marcos’s snub of Jessica Soho scores him a huge PR win and sends ABS-CBN laughing all the way to the bank,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/bongbong-marcoss-snub-of-jessica-soho-scores-him-a-huge-pr-win-and-sends-abs-cbn-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/,"I didn’t watch the Jessica Soho interviews with the “major” Opposition presidential candidates? Why should I? The show is essentially a talk fest with a bunch of losers competing for second place. By declining the invite, Bongbong Marcos actually made a louder more resonant statement than all of his rivals combined.
More importantly, Marcos’s snub of Jessica Soho’s show further highlighted how irrelevant Big Corporate Media has become in these elections. Marcos had, after all, spent decades building his political capital without the benefit of any support — even attracting downright antagonism — not only from the country’s biggest media conglomerates but also from their cronies in Western Europe and North America. Why then would Soho and her newfound Yellowtard fans presume to be the boss of Marcos today?
Rumours are now circulating that the GMA network has lost millions as a result of advertisers backing out from ad slots for Soho’s show. This is still to be confirmed as of this writing but it seems quite plausible. Meanwhile, Marcos reportedly accepted an invitation to be interviewed by ABS-CBN’s Boy Abunda. How’s that for irony? One can imagine ABS-CBN now laughing all the way to the bank with all the ad money Marcos will be pulling in for them.
This is effectively a reverse of roles now. Marcos could be the first Filipino politician who’s succeeded at beating Big Corporate Media at their own game. All this while the Yellowtards are left desperately trying to fashion Soho as a pambansang HR manager likening Marcos as some sort of job applicant refusing to be interviewed for the job he is bidding for. Quite presumptuous that the Yellowtards presume to be an authority on who represents the Filipino people in this episode considering their candidate Leni Robredo’s voter preference rating has consistently lagged Marcos’s by a huge margin in more than a few surveys conducted by several reputable polling firms.
The fact is, GMA and its “talent” Jessica Soho needed Bongbong Marcos more than he needed them. For that matter Robredo and the rest of the Opposition nuisance candidates needed Marcos too. Indeed, the screeching and gnashing of teeth we now spy all over social media is the sound of these bozos and their fantards crying over being deprived of a chance to share a public forum with Marcos. Sad, isn’t it?
Today’s Philippine Opposition is, indeed, a sad sight to behold as their lot have yet again proven, thanks to their behaviour today, that they need Marcos to provide substance to their vacuous rheroric. That would be even sadder than sad if it weren’t for the fact that the way the Opposition conduct themselves today is downright dishonest. Filipinos deserve better than the crooked Opposition personalities we see today and the pathetic campaigns they mount which together amount to not much more than an insult to the Filipino people.",Politics
Bongbong Marcos need not attend any debates either,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/bongbong-marcos-need-not-attend-any-debates-either/,"Imagine a public debate among presidential candidates that does not include administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos. That debate will essentially be between a bunch of vacuous politicians — Leni Roredo, Manny Pacquiao, and Isko Moreno. The only other presidential candidate is Ping Lacson who would stand out as the most intelligent, most articulate, and most seasoned among them. He’ll come up on top of any debate participated in by the other morons hands down. What would that mean for Bongbong Marcos (not considering for now the obvious cost of being labelled “coward” by his critics for declining to participate)? Very likely nothing much. Lacson will end up taking votes away from Robredo, Moreno, and Pacquiao but probably not enough for him to win that second place slot in the race he and his fellow Opposition candidates covet.
Most of the Opposition candidates, after all, have been campaigning for national leadership only over the last couple of months. Robredo could be an exception — because she has been campaigning for the Opposition since 2016 over much of her term as President Rodrigo Duterte’s “vice president”. However, it is evident that all that campaigning did not serve Robredo well seeing that her popularity and trust rating numbers confirmed by several reputable polling firms over the last year or two have not been moved by that campaign. Marcos, on the other hand, has been steadily building his profile and political brand for years, mostly under the radar, mostly dismissed as an unlikely force to contend with until now. Three months of campaign to go does not stack up as significant within the frame of the decades Marcos and his family have invested in building political capital. As such, it is likely that most of his committed supporters — a formidable number that the Opposition have yet to come to terms with — have also been on board with him over similar timeframes.
In short, Marcos’s support base is not composed of casual newly-acquired followers. They are likely long-term followers who have come to know him and what he stands for over time frames measured in years, even decades. In contrast, it is likely that a bigger chunk of the support base of other presidential hopefuls are recent acquisitions who were sold on their candidates’ relatively short-sighted campaigns within the context of just these specific elections. There seems to be no reason for the average Marcos supporter to switch sides on the basis of whether or not their candidate participates in a debate or any other media circus. Indeed, as long-term Marcos supporters, most will by now have thoroughly thought through their support for Marcos. Considering that Marcos’s long-term followers will have, over those periods, followed the routine demonisation Marcos and his family have copped for decades, stood up to the social stigma of being a Marcos supporter, and still remained committed supporters, the likelihood of the emergence over the next three months of any further information or behaviours that would be cause for them to seriously consider changing their minds about Marcos is quite slim. What’s three months in the context of years of long-term committed support, right?
Of course this does not mean debates have no benefit even to a candidate such as Marcos who enjoys a massive lead over the rest of his rival candidates combined. Declining every media event in the next three months is really more an extreme worst-case-scenario on top of which everything else is essentially a bonus to the Marcos campaign. The bottom line is that the Opposition need Marcos more than he needs them. The Media need the ad revenue his presence can pull in and the Opposition need him to be a whipping boy to serve as a smokescreen to their substance-deficited campaigns. Indeed, Robredo in particular needs him the most because she had described her run for the presidency as one that aims to “prevent the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang”. Marcos is actually a major pillar of the Yellowtard ideology that underpins Robredo’s campaign rhetoric.
From hereon, Bongbong Marcos has the luxury to choose his media appearances. It is pure luxury because he already enjoys mass communication channels independent of Big Corporate Media — a network of social media users, a YouTube channel with a massive following, and an alternative community of media and social media personalities who are “friendly” to his cause to whom he could extend the privilege of his presence. Indeed, with today’s technology, even a debate can be organised by any citizen media organisation and this is what is likely behind the defensiveness of traditional media personalities and executives and their continued beholdenness to traditional credentials bestowed top-down by central “committees” (as opposed to credibility built from the grassroots up as what today’s technology allows). The irony here is that the status quo — of central committees, big institutions that monopolise power over information, and public personalities who block dissent — is within the interests of mainly Opposition members, their leaders, and their allies to continue to prop up and sustain. This contradicts much of what they espouse and it is likely that the public have come to realise this.
Does Bongbong Marcos need to go to any further media events such as a public debate? He does not need to but he can if there’s something in it form him. Big Corporate Media personalities can no longer act like gods who presume to summon politicians to their lairs. The Filipino public have taken back that power from them and they only have themselves to blame for abusing the public’s trust for many decades.",Politics
Leni Robredo and Manny Pacquiao jointly EXPLOIT devastation wrought by Typhoon Odette for political gain,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/leni-robredo-and-manny-pacquiao-jointly-exploit-devastation-wrought-by-typhoon-odette-for-political-gain/,"True to the unimaginative character of the Opposition campaign led by Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo, Typhoon Odette’s visit this weekend presented what seemed to be a grand opportunity for Robredo and her pinky team to, well, grandstand before the cameras. An added bonus was boxing champ and rival presidential candidate calling for various partisan camps to pool resources to “help out” in the relief effort. Perhaps not surprisingly, only Robredo responded to the call. Not surprising, is the meeting of the two minds to exploit this opportunity to perform for the cameras. Both, after all, run the two most intellectually-bankrupt campaigns in these national elections.
What do two politicians with an obvious agenda really have to offer to the most recent victims of what is, in essence, just another garden-variety typhoon very much familiar to Filipinos of any generation? Between the two, only Robredo is an actual executive government official (or so we are told by those who believe that she actually won the vice presidency in 2016). Pacquiao is a senator and, as such, not one whose official role is to direct public services. Robredo like Pacquiao, however, does not have command over any state resources that are in the best position to deliver disaster response and relief services at scale. Only the president who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the executive ultimately in charge of the police and Coast Guard exercises any influence on how resources are allocated to the effort.
The best Robredo could do is to employ a combination of (1) the resources she is authorised to deploy from her own Office of the Vice President, (2) the resources funded by her campaign contributions, (3) her own personal resources, and (4) contributions collected through the parallel fundraising initiatives she and her supporters organised. Step back and take stock of all this and we will see that it is a mishmash of state and politically-motivated resources that supports this “relief effort”. On top of all this sits Leni Robredo’s political brand which, in turn, gives dishonest credence to the notion that she is the one person to thank for this service of purportedly national proportions and that all the rest don’t measure up.
How else could one possibly believe that all of what Robredo exhibits is part of a genuine initiative to serve the public if Robredo’s cheerleaders routinely inject traditional mudslinging into their cheers? Pacquiao for his part was clear as to what the spirit of the effort should have been. His original call to his fellow presidential bets was to “come together and set aside politics to help people”. Clearly, Robredo and her titas don’t seem to be getting into the spirit of things.
What most of those who are quick to lap up the insidious messianic messages underlying Robredo’s and, to a lesser extent, Pacquiao’s posturing over the course of Odette’s visit fail to appreciate is that disaster response and relief operations are only the tip of the iceberg that is the overall state apparatus to build the right capabilities and maintain a state of readiness to mitigate the country’s risk exposure to natural calamities. Robredo is the proverbial heroic fireman who gets featured in all the movies and children’s books. Uncelebrated are the people who do the more mundane jobs like keeping the fire extinguishers fresh, implementing safety systems, and keeping people informed and drilled on emergency fire procedures.
As President Rodrigo Duterte points out, you can’t be president if your idea of leading is to be there just to play that heroic fireman before the cameras. That’s not being a leader. That’s just being an asshole.",Politics
Opposition “thought leaders” want us to believe they will lose the elections because of ignorant voters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/opposition-thought-leaders-want-us-to-believe-they-will-lose-the-elections-because-of-ignorant-voters/,"We’re about 15 years into the age of social media and people. It is part of our lives and much as there are now quarters in society that seek to demonize it, the fact is humanity remains squarely in a trajectory that leads to a world where human behaviour is increasingly guided — very likely driven — by one machine algorithm or another.
Indeed, social media just happens to be the easy most politicised target for vilification. The fact is, however, we have long ago been subservient to algorithms. Think of those traffic lights that guide your driving. We wholeheartedly trust a green light assured that, as it signals us to proceed, it is signalling others to stop and give way to us. Stepping back further, consider other mundane examples. Airplanes carrying hundreds of people are routinely landed by algorithms. Crewmembers of fast food outlets like McDonald’s move to the instructions displayed on monitors by computerised order fulfillment systems. Closer to home, drivers that form the vast on-demand delivery and transport systems of Uber, Grab, and FoodPanda are no better than blind aimless ants derailed from their pheromone trail without the apps through which the system they are a part of direct their actions.
One therefore comes to thinking about these elections. The Philippine Opposition have turned into a chi chi fashion statement the blaming of all their troubles on social media and the bits of “disinformation” (along with “legit” information) that live, breed, and die within its ecosystem. They whine about one partisan camp “weaponising” it to their “nefarious” ends. One wonders though; if it was the Opposition that had been more successful at using social media (which, one needs to be reminded, is a tool available to everyone) to achieve their “disente” ends, would they and their lackeys in Big Corporate “News” Media still describe the way they wielded it with a loaded word like “weaponise”?
A certain Vip Malixi who is a “freelance iOS developer, cartoonist, and writer who covers information technology and psychology” was given a bit of space on the Inquirer today to warn the peasantry about how social media is skewing their world view and issues this pompous lament…
I find this state of things depressing, as the average Joe, indeed, will not bother to make the extra effort to find out what’s what. The result: These social media companies are priming an army of ignorant people, who can be more easily manipulated, to lead our society to god-knows-what ends.
Well now, “priming an army of ignorant people”. Gee, that’s you and me, right? This is the professor suggesting that whoever is losing in these elections are “victims” of “ignorant” voters who were “easily manipulated” by presumably “evil” forces. That’s a convenient excuse for losing elections that is certainly on its way to become an overused one. One wonders if the Opposition led by the Yellowtard bloc have their own social media operations; because if they do have one (and most likely they do have one) then they are hypocrites.
The fact is, the Yellowtards are losing this popularity contest because they did not choose their weapons well and wield what they chose competently. They’re effectively saying that they lost because the enemy fought better — but said in a shrill whiny way. Social media is here to stay and it is evolving at a pace that keeps it five steps ahead of legislation and regulators. Best way to deal with it is to see it for the sword that it is and be a better swordsman in the battles you choose.",Politics
Is Leni Robredo really SINGLE-HANDEDLY on top of the Typhoon Odette relief effort?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/is-leni-robredo-really-single-handedly-on-top-of-the-typhoon-odette-relief-effort/,"If we are to believe Chief Yellowtard “economist” JC Punongbayan, presidential candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo is the only person really on top of the relief operations surrounding the havoc wrought by Typhoon Ria (local codename “Odette”).
Rappler and ABS-CBN say so, his fellow Yellowtards say so, and Robredo herself says so. So it must be so. Punongbayan mirrors the attitude applied by the Yellowtard-led Opposition to their campaign — that they are the only ones with all the ideas on how to run the country.
“Tomorrow, our relief operations will resume. Ang assurance ko po sa inyo, mapupuntahan lahat ng lugar na nasalanta. Kung hindi po ako mismo dahil solong katawan po ako, iyong teams po namin…lahat ng lugar, maaabot po ng teams namin on the ground kasi halos anim na taon na namin itong ginagawa,” Robredo said.
(My assurance to you is that we will reach all the places that have been hit. If I cannot go there myself, our teams on the ground will be able to reach you because this is something we have been doing for almost six years.)
Robredo speaks as if the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Coast Guard, the Philippine Police, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the various local governments don’t exist. It’s as if she and her team are single-handedly saving the day.
Considering that much of this “relief effort” will ultimately serve as fodder for Robredo’s desperate campaign, it could well be that hers is very likely Philippine history’s most dishonest election campaign. She is effectively campaigning at the expense of her own government and is seriously and deliberately misleading the Filipino public.
If Robredo has any decency left in her, she should apologise to every government employee and public servant who is working hard and working quietly to do deliver essential services to Filipinos impacted by this disaster.",Politics
Opposition “thought leaders” seek to CRUSH Filipinos’ hopes for the New Year just to win the election,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/opposition-thought-leaders-seek-to-crush-filipinos-hopes-for-the-new-year-just-to-win-the-election/,"The Fourth Quarter 2021 Social Weather Survey report reveals that “93% of adult Filipinos” are “entering the New Year with hope rather than with fear.” With 2022 being an election year, these figures could be interpreted as an indication that Filipinos have confidence in the abilities of politicians most likely to be elected next year. This is also important insight for Opposition camps that are using fear and hate as cornerstones of their campaign.
This tweet by Chief Yellowtard “Economist” JC Punongbayan pretty much encapsulates the Opposition hate campaign.
By asserting that if administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos wins the election on May 2022, the Philippines will be a disaster area over the next six years, Punongbayan is demonstrating an intent to crush the hopes of the 50+ percent of Filipino voters who plan to vote for Marcos. Surveys conducted by more than a few reputable polling firms have consistently yielded figures that affirm this prognosis and even notable “thought leaders” of the Opposition camp have expressed dismay over the failed campaign of their preferred candidates.
The fact of the persistent formidable lead of Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte combined with the general positive outlook a large proportion of Filipinos hold for the future should prompt reflection among Opposition partisans, specially influential ones like Punongbayan. Is it really wise to be belittling — even insulting — the personal preferences of a huge bloc of voters that their campaign ought to be taking all efforts to engage with and possibly even convert?
For that matter, whatever partisan camp one may happen to associate with, what value is there in painting a hopeless picture of the future? Elections are supposed to be an exercise that attracts hope — hope that the next leader will carry on what worked well over his predecessor’s term and hope that he or she will break further ground to build upon all that. To summarily write off that hope for political ends is the work of the sort of people who routinely fail to understand the whole point of democracy.
The whole point of democracy is that certain decisions that are of national consequence (such as who gets to be president) are entrusted to voters. Who or what attracts the most votes determines what happens next. If, as Punongbayan predicts, a “catastrophe” awaits the nation if the people’s choice wins, well, so be it. That’s just democracy being democracy.",Politics

Both were originally wearing yellow and, at the time, on the campaign trail for the 2016 elections. This tweet from October 2015 shows the same image used back then but with its original colours.
The whole trouble with the Yellowtards is that they are all optics with very little substance to back their form. This is evident in how they think they can simply change their political colours and mask the now-discredited narrative that was the Yellowtard ideology of “martyred heroes” that once dominated mainstream Philippine politics. This latest stunt proves that their platform (if it can even be called that) is to insult the intelligence of Filipino voters and not much else.

Dec 1 to 6 2021 Pulse Asia Survey affirms grim prospects for Leni Robredo campaign,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/dec-1-to-6-2021-pulse-asia-survey-affirms-grim-prospects-for-leni-robredo-campaign/,"Same result different survey. The most recent Pulse Asia survey on voter preference had yet again shown Bongbong Marcos as the top preferred presidential candidate of a majority (53 percent) of respondents. Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo is a far second with just 20 percent. The results are consistent to two previous recent reports (Publicus Asia and Laylo) on voter preferences indicating that Marcos and, very likely, his running mate Sara Duterte will win the presidency and vice presidency respectively come May 2022.
The Opposition remain optimistic probably because pessimism is not an option. There is no other way to go but soldier on and many among their ranks have expressed a chilling sentiment — that defeat is not an option. Former Inquirer editor John Nery articulates the logic that props up this fascinating optimism.
Nery also draws energy from beliefs amongst members of his camp within their echo chambers that Robredo’s campaign is an actual “movement” that just needs to be managed properly. Nery, however, points out that evidence that Robredo had, indeed, launched a “movement” comes in the form of “negative proof”.
More negative proof came in the last couple of weeks, including but not limited to the heated debates between Robredo supporters a) over the kind of billboards that should be put up, b) whether columnist Manuel L. Quezon was right to assert that Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had successfully claimed the mantle of change and that the Vice President had failed to define herself in the public mind, and c) if the ornery controversialist Miyako Isabel diagnosed the Robredo campaign’s media and communications failures right.
Yellowtard “thought leaders” like Nery seem to tiptoe around the elephant in the room — that Robredo’s campaign suffers from a lack of strong leadership. This, by itself, speaks of Robredo herself and could be indicative of the sort of president she will be — one pulled in different directions by the same sorts of idiots that surround her today.
Robredo’s campaign evidently continues to struggle, which is strange considering that she has, in fact, been campaigning since she was proclaimed “vice president” back in 2016. Right there is the one thing really worth thinking about when considering Leni Robredo. If she can’t get her shit together even now — even after years as “vice president” and over that same period regarded as de facto “leader” of the Opposition — what sort of government will she run as president?",Politics
Leni Robredo desperately stammers her way through a good Boy Abunda GRILLING!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/leni-robredo-desperately-stammers-her-way-through-a-good-boy-abunda-grilling/,"The only thing Opposition partisans can say about ABS-CBN personality Boy Abunda’s interview of Leni Robredo is that he “interrupted her a lot”. That’s actually not true. Abunda was constantly trying to steer Robredo back on topic and, in most cases, reiterating the question of the segment.
The trouble with Leni Robredo is that she was too reactive to Abunda’s questions which were evidently designed to test the breadth and depth of context that his interviewee would be able to apply in his or her response. An example of Robredo falling into this trap is her responses to Abunda’s questions on how to pay the national debt. In reality, no one president can “pay” the national debt. It can, under his or her watch within his or her term, be serviced and managed to certain economic and fiscal parameters. This is part of the day job of the Secretary of Finance. Rather than stammer through a lame attempt to answer what was clearly a trick question, Robredo could have simply responded by saying the above — that debt servicing be kept reasonable, that debt levels be managed within the frame of forecast economic performance, and that she will work closely with her economic and fiscal managers to achieve these debt management goals. Easy, right?
The most awkward segment of the interview — one that Robredo visibly struggled with and where the profound inconsistency of the ideological underpinnings of her campaign became apparent — was Abunda’s question on abortion. Abortion is a cornerstone of the feminist movement. Feminists are big on this whole “my body my choice” thing. Considering that Robredo’s “pink” campaign theme panders to the feminist community, it is clear that she is allowing her personal Catholic faith to cloud her judgment. Indeed, Robredo’s revelation that she consults a lot with Catholic priests is a red flag. Catholic priesthood is Western civilisation’s most ancient boys’ club. To be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman’s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned.
This is the whole trouble with the Yellowtards. They claim to be liberal and presume to be chummy with the gay community and the feminist movement. However, the Yellowtards’ top leaders are also outwardly prayerful and schmooze a lot with Catholic bishops and priests. The Roman Catholic Church is clear on its position with regard to homosexuality and the sorts of liberal lifestyles and pro-choice philosophies espoused by the gay and feminist communities. All of these run counter to Catholic dogma which is deeply incompatible with liberalism.
Robredo herself admitted in the interview that she finds herself “conflicted” by all this. This is disturbing considering that the Philippines aspires to join the ranks of modern liberal democracies that host societies where tolerance for diversity of lifestyles and life choices is paramount. The Roman Catholic faith is not compatible with this aspiration and Robredo, being a professed devout Catholic cannot claim to be an authentic liberal in this regard.
Fish are caught by the mouth and Robredo had bitten the proverbial hook and was effectively reeled in out of her depth and found herself gasping for oxygen. Perhaps her Yellowtard followers should, instead, be thanking Boy Abunda for interrupting her frequently. If he didn’t, Robredo could have made an even bigger fool of herself and damaged further her already floundering campaign.",Politics
The Yellowtards are deluding themselves into thinking Leni Robredo did well in her interview with Boy Abunda,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/the-yellowtards-are-deluding-themselves-into-thinking-leni-robredo-did-well-in-her-interview-with-boy-abunda/,"Within the exclusive echo chambers of the Philippine Opposition, the narrative of Yellowtardism continues to thrive. This is thanks to one skill the Yellowtards are known for — their talent for creating alternate realities to keep their lot deluded that they are Philippine politics’ “good guys” who are entitled to win every Philippine election.
Not having learnt much from their catastrophic losses in 2016 and 2019, the Yellowtards continue this quaint habit. This week their mass delusion revolves around Leni Robredo’s interview with ABS-CBN talk show host Boy Abunda. Robredo was clearly out of her depth, struggling under time pressure to cobble together responses to Abunda’s pointed questions. It was evident Robredo was all over the place and her lack of coherence continuously forced Abunda to intervene to help his embattled subject remain on track.
Robredo’s time with Abunda was nothing short of Amateur Hour and everyone knew it. The Yellowtard machine has since shifted to damage control and has mobilised every corner of their crony network to the job of explaining away the dumbness on exhibit by finding scapegoats. Top on their list, of course, was the host Boy Abunda himself. But of course. Abunda kept “interrupting” Robredo and “mansplaining” stuff to her. Robredo was a victim in this interview they tell us. Abunda fielded “trick questions” in order to “trap” Robredo into making dumb remarks before the camera. The fiasco was everybody’s fault. Robredo is the victim here.
To the Yellowtards, Leni Robredo could do no wrong. How could she? She is one of the “good guys”. The “enemy” is the “evil” force of tyranny that seeks to seize political power and turn the Philippines back into a horrible horrible place. The only path to heaven for Filipinos is the Yellowtard Way and this, we are told, is why we must “let Leni lead”. Why not Bongbong, Isko, Manny, or Ping? Robredo has a list of reasons.
Why do the Yellowtards think Filipinos should vote for Robredo? Get this: because she is a woman. Evidence of this is how Robredo the Woman was there in every crisis. Take note, the Yellowtards expect Filipinos to vote for Robredo just because she is a woman and women “shine” during crises. If this isn’t the single biggest insult to the intelligence of the Filipino Voter yet, it is hard to imagine what will top that in the remaining three months of this campaign.
What to do with Robredo and the Yellowtards. They may have formed the worst Opposition in Philippine history and, to the credit of a vastly more mature electorate, have consistently performed dismally in preference survey after preference survey conducted by reputable polling firms over the last 12 to 18 months. Still, they are a noisy and shrill minority and have all but conscripted Big Corporate Media to their dishonest “cause”. The Yellowtards are an unnecessary blight to this noble democratic exercise where there is lots of important work to do regarding politics from the lens of an authentic concern for the future and a commitment to charting a path forward through difficult circumstances that are expected to persist.
The Yellowtards are likely to lose in May this year but their mission to keep Philippine politics diseased will continue. These elections will not spell the end for Robredo and the Yellowtards as they will continue to infest the discourse and sabotage a nation’s effort to pull itself together. It is up to Filipinos to filter out unnecessary noise and focus on the job at hand — building a strong and prosperous nation.",Politics
On the Yellowtards’ BORING habit of blaming “trolls” for all their troubles,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/on-the-yellowtards-boring-habit-of-blaming-trolls-for-all-their-troubles/,"It is getting tiresome hearing how “baffled” Opposition “thought leaders” are with regard to how badly their lot are doing in the campaign leading to this year’s elections. The latest crybaby ruminations on this situation comes from Inquirer columnist Jose Montelibano who today writes on the “improbability” of all this. According to Montelibano, the spectacular rise in voters’ preference for presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos as concluded from more than a few reputable surveys conducted over the last couple of years is a “statistical improbability”.
Montelibano then launches into his “analysis” asserting that it is really “money, lots and lots of money” and not genuine popularity that is driving these statistics. And where is all this money being spent on? Montelibano goes down the all-too-familiar “political analysis” path that many before him have trod. The money is being spent on “trolls”.
But of course, right? How else can one explain why Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo’s “pink” campaign has so far been a dismal failure. It is because “trolls” are being paid by the administration camp of Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte to “spread lies” all over the Net.
And so what actionable insights does Montelibano, the most recent would-be “political analyst” baffled by the Yellowtards’ failure, have to share with us after his monumental buntong-hininga “analysis” today? Here we go…
2022 is inside a greater period of turbulence. We all have hopes but we all must stay grounded on hard reality. Trolls and fake accounts cannot vote. Worse, when we are in trouble, they cannot help us, they cannot feed a single mouth. That is why it is, to me, a case of improbabilities, trolls versus warm bodies, fake accounts versus voters. It will be a messy election, and only for the brave.
Montelibano suggests that the Opposition are not only the “good” guys in this laban between “good” and “evil”, they are also the only warm-blooded parties in these elections with all the non-Yellowtard rest of us being the cold-blooded reptiles of their obsolete narrative. Like his colleague Manuel L Quezon III the other day, Montelibano inadvertently reveals why the Opposition are failing to reach and engage the voters they need to convert to their “cause”. It is not because of the mythical “trolls” that populate their political faerie tales. It is because of the elitism that continues to shine through the thin veneers of humility they try to put on for their lame PR stunts.
How, after all, can you convince a Marcos supporter to change her mind about her preference if you are perceived to be some pompous pale-skinned limpwrist looking down on them from that proverbial Hill in Katipunan regarding her like some sort of invertebrate while mouthing patronising clichés about “messy elections” that are “only for the brave”? No. The Yellowtards are not losing these elections because of “trolls”. They are losing it because they are running the inferior campaign. And that is the reality they will need to face over the remaining several months.",Politics
Five things that are wrong about Leni Robredo’s campaign for President,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/five-things-that-are-wrong-about-leni-robredos-campaign-for-president/,"Philippine Vice President Leonor “Leni” Robredo is going to get a rude shock when she loses the 2022 Presidential Election to former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr (BBM). She’s going to be shocked because she is living in a bubble. Her supporters and allies from mainstream media are hiding the truth from her — that the voters do not like her and do not want her to be President.
Her supporters probably choose to protect her from the reality on the ground because they are afraid she might lose her motivation to run for President. They need not worry. It is very unlikely for Robredo to give up the fight against BBM. Aside from Robredo being dense, this fight has become personal for her. It will be embarrassing for her to lose to BBM after he lost his electoral protest (it’s more like the electoral tribunal sat on his protest until it got stale) against her in the 2016 elections for Vice President.
It’s going to take a miracle by the name of Andres Bautista or some sort of divine intervention from Uncle Sam to stop a “Marcos return” to Malacanang. BBM has been consistently at the top of popularity surveys, enjoying a very big gap between him and all the other nuisance candidates. Yes, everybody else — including Robredo — are nuisance candidates. Robredo in particular has become the country’s laughingstock because of the antics she performs just to attract voters. Her PR team is evidently not the best and the brightest of the lot. They make her do silly things in their misguided effort to get the C and D crowd or, in their own words, the “bakya” crowd on their side. They really got it all wrong. There are a lot of problems with Robredo’s campaign strategy. Let us enumerate them.
1. Robredo’s PR team comes up with the lamest ideas to sell her to the public.
Her PR team made her appear in various TikTok videos where her goofing off in these had disastrous consequences for her campaign. She’s tried being a stand-up comic with her VP tandem Senator Kiko Pangilinan, she’s tried performing a Hadouken against words, and she’s guested on a social media show hosted by a supposedly popular dude who just made her look stupid. All of her performances and guest appearances were cringe-worthy. They only made good fodder for meme creators feasting on her vacuousness.
2. Robredo’s rabid supporters are elitist.
A lot of Robredo’s supporters are either socialites or social climbers who want to be like the socialites. These people are self-righteous and expect the rest of Philippine society to think and behave like them. They also claim to be pious and decent. The problem with their behaviour is they turn off the “bugoy” or rugged crowd. Their attempts at trying to reach the people from the lower classes just comes across as condescending. Proof of this is when they gave out small packs or rice with fish sauce for making congee or “lugaw”.
What kind of people comes up with stuff like that?!? It’s an insult to people who don’t have anything to eat or to those who need to eat more nutritious food but just can’t afford to.
3. Going from yellow to pink was the first and worst decisions Robredo’s team made.
They wanted to make a statement by changing their colour motif but the only statement this made was to prove that the yellow colour or the Liberal Party brand is dead and could not be revived after two successive losses in previous elections.
4. They don’t learn from their mistakes.
Robredo’s camp is the very definition of stupidity. They keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result every time. Robredo’s campaign manager seems to only want to spend the money allotted for advertising and PR companies as fast as he could. Those people are laughing all the way to the bank while making Robredo look like a fool.
Really, these people should have learned from Mar Roxas’s PR stunts. However, they instead tried to copy his failed campaign strategy.
5. The main problem with Robredo’s campaign strategy is Robredo herself.
She is just not cool. Granted that her PR team does not give her much to work with, Robredo’s execution is simply pathetic just the same. A natural performer can actually pull off corny stuff. Robredo’s performance is just too forced. It is just not her. She wants to appear comedic but her timing is bad. The average man on the street does not buy it.
Robredo is too dumb to realise too that she is being made to appear stupid in every one of these PR stunts. She is basically the problem of her campaign.
* * *
No one from Robredo’s camp is prepared to admit that despite being the Vice President and having been the Darling of the Media for six years, Robredo is still not popular with the voters. Their top honchos blame everything and everybody else except her, her PR team, and her supporters for their dismal popularity ratings. Robredo is simply a hard sell and no amount of money poured in to PR companies and advertising agencies can help her.",Politics
“LUGAW” is what makes Leni Robredo’s campaign come across as ELITIST,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/lugaw-is-what-makes-leni-robredos-campaign-come-across-as-elitist/,"C’mon, you really think making lugaw (glutinous rice gruel or porridge) a pillar of your political brand will make you come across as makamasa (for the masses)? Think again. Feeding lugaw to “the poor” only goes further to reinforce the patronising manner with which the Philippines’ upper classes regard the masses. Presidential candidate Leni Robredo’s lugaw campaign is just as patronising as her pal Mar Roxas’s was back during his own bid for the presidency.
A recent photo featuring essential ingredients for cooking lugaw packaged into campaign paraphernalia for Robredo’s campaign is being passed around on social media and attracting ridicule.
The photos only served to further highlight the impoverished notions of nutrition that likely date back to the end of World War II. That they haven’t changed much in 75 years is telling enough. That Robredo’s campaign contributes to its persistence is downright disturbing. It’s as if Robredo is telling Filipinos, lugaw is your saviour and we are here to serve you some.
This is perhaps the reason why Robredo serves this impoverished meal with a smile.
What kind of message does feeding lugaw to people who, on many occasions, very likely don’t have much else in the way of other options available to fill their stomachs? For most members of Robredo’s campaign team, lugaw is a mere tool for signalling their temporary solidarity with a community whose votes they desperately seek to attract. But like the way lugaw is rapidly-digested and, as such, does not alleviate hunger for long, Robredo’s campaign is a hollow and dishonest distraction that creates only an illusory feeling of hope that just as rapidly fades when the circus leaves town.",Politics
Rowena Guanzon a hypocrite for leaking her decision on Bongbong Marcos disqualification petition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/rowena-guanzon-a-hypocrite-for-leaking-her-decision-on-bongbong-marcos-disqualification-petition/,"Commission on Elections (COMELEC) commissioner Rowena Guanzon should have know better. Leaking her decision on the disqualification petition against administration candidate Bongbong Marcos to the media was wrong because it violates the “sub judice” rule for cases that are still in review. No less than COMELEC spokesperson James Jimenez himself explained in his piece “Sub judice” published in the Business Mirror on April 2018 this rule that Guanzon now violates with impunity…
It is a rule that, in essence, restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to pending judicial proceedings, as a well settled limitation on the freedom of speech. It encompasses not only the participants in the pending case, including the members of the bar and bench, the litigants and witnesses, but also to the public in general—necessarily covering statements made by public officials.
Jimenez goes on to write about what he thinks motivates people to break this rule and why he disagrees with their reasons for doing so…
I understand why people choose to ignore the rule, and why some quarters would rather hear—or read about— battling soundbites. It’s certainly more exciting that way and, on a more practical note, probably provides a comforting buffer against an uncertain (or predictable, depending on how you look at things) outcome. I understand, sure, but I disagree. Despite the adrenalin rush of being in a wild-wild-west environment created by ignoring the sub judice rule, the fact remains that it ultimately does not advance the cause of determining the truth about the issues at hand. Quite the opposite.
Even more interesting is that Guanzon herself is a stickler for this rule and seems to apply it selectively on parties that are, shall we say, associated with political camps that are opposed to those she is evidently loyal to. In 2019, Guanzon invoked the sub judice rule while overseeing the review of petitions filed against former National Youth Commission (NYC) chairman Ronald Cardema whose application for substitution as the first nominee of the Duterte Youth party-list was being protested at the time by the College Editors’ Guild of the Philippines, the National Union of Students of the Philippines, and Youth Act Against Tyranny. Guanzon reportedly warned participants in the review…
“Refrain from giving interviews since he [Cardema] is already sub judice,” Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon said during the first hearing of the case.
The same Inquirer report notes; “A violation of this rule is punishable under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court”, suggesting that Guanzon could be in contempt as it applies to quasi-judicial bodies such as the COMELEC. Nonetheless media organisations allied with the Opposition are only too happy to indulge Guanzon’s impunity with Rapplerette Paterno Esmaquel II getting up close and personal with the “embattled” COMELEC commisioner.
NOW: Rappler’s news editor @paterno_II sits down with feisty Commissioner  @rowena_guanzon to dig deeper into the infighting among Comelec officials and what led her to cast a vote against the candidacy of the ousted dictator’s son.#RapplerTalk: https://t.co/Pib497VMqf
— Rappler (@rapplerdotcom) January 28, 2022
It is clear that rules, as far as Yellowtards see them, magically turn into mere recommendations whenever it suits their dishonest agendas. In this particular case, it is quite evident that Guanzon is acting in desperation — desperation to fulfill her role as the Yellowtard COMELEC commissioner the Opposition are counting on to commandeer her office to the noble mission of preventing another Marcos presidency. And these crooks wonder why Filipinos are so on to them and their dishonest campaign.",Politics
The “wokes”: providing misleading answers to the wrong questions,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/the-wokes-providing-misleading-answers-to-the-wrong-questions/,"History points out how human civilizations and societies have evolved. From the simple hunter-gatherer groups of peoples to the extremely complicated and interconnected relationships built through globalization, humans have definitely found ways to persevere and achieve greater human development that would even leave our ancestors astonished. However, beyond these marvelous achievements of the human race, some sectors of our society ended up becoming victims of our own successes, creating marginalized individuals who demand inclusivity in the political economy.
To address these kinds of social issues, the “wokes” grouped together, stood up, and continue to denounce prejudice and discrimination present in the society. These wokes preach about equality by correcting the wrongs of the past, calling for a levelling of the playing field. This can be done, they say, through government intervention and personal action. The “stay woke” movement sounds like music to the ears of the oppressed, but it is an ideal obviously a bit removed from the realities of life. This can be observed in what these wokes are practicing and embracing: identity politics and cancel culture, which create further division and confusion, while indirectly oppressing the most vulnerable sectors of the country.
Identity politics is when a person aligns himself/herself accordingly on identifying factors based on identities that include but are not limited to ethnicity, religion, gender, ideology, and social class. With identity politics, they create a political agenda based on what is more beneficial to them, whether basic human freedoms are trampled on or not. An example of this in the United States is when vocal members of the LGBT community and hardline believers of the Islamic faith publicly abhor discrimination, but cannot find common interests that they can align themselves with. In turn, a language of continuous animosity is created in between them and, as a result, there is no middle ground for constructive dialogue to exist. Tolerance and acceptance seem to be utterly absent in their agenda.
On the other hand, cancel culture is when an individual or groups of individuals are called-out as a form of ostracizing them from the society. They can be denounced through various social platforms, where in severe cases, the victims’ economic capabilities are degraded by boycotting their products or services. Practitioners of cancel culture point out that their actions promote accountability and as to what is socially acceptable. Unfortunately, as a free country, such behavior is reprehensible because it curtails vital civil liberties through censorship.
This lethal concoction of identity politics and cancel culture that the woke movement has been actively involved with seems uncannily similar to this dictatorship of the proletariat that numerous Marxists, leftists, and communists have been proclaiming relentlessly. In his book The Road to Serfdom, Friedrich Hayek, a noted Nobel Prize laureate in economics, was quick to point out that this dictatorship would end up destroying personal freedoms. The wokes hope to propagate the notion that in engineering a society dedicated to equality lies the greater good for all. However, a mixture of identity politics and cancel culture ends up disenfranchising the majority, further alienating these minority groups, and creates further subservience to what is popular instead of what is practically sound. This “us versus them” mentality that can be observed from such a social movement is inherently divisive and unwise, chaining our integral liberties that make our country a liberal democracy. Quoting another Nobel prize laureate in economics in Milton Friedman, “A society that puts equality before freedom will achieve neither”.
Further exploring the possible repercussions of what these wokes are practicing,  we find that they endanger the society by creating extractive institutions in the long run, both in the realms of politics and economics. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson’s book entitled Why Nations Fail shows how countries and civilizations end up failing because of these extractive institutions, where significant portions of the population are unable to participate or outright prevented from participating in economic activities and affairs. Boycotting businesses that have an opposing ideology or political belief than what they have is definitely a concrete example of activities that galvanize extractive institutions. These kinds of institutionalized means of extracting economic capabilities would just further empower an economic and political elite as the only beneficiaries, which these wokes undeniably dream to become.
What our countrymen should advocate should never be what these wokes are embracing. We should focus more on creating and preserving inclusive political and economic institutions. Inclusive institutions allow participation of the different sectors of the society in both political decisions and economic activities, which would prove to be highly beneficial to the marginalized groups. These include rule of law instead of trial by publicity, incentives for increased productivity instead of punishment or humiliation, and honest competition instead of underhanded tactics. Through these, opportunities to innovate arise via creative destruction, where a nation-state is given a chance to shun outdated and obsolete policies in favor of greater productivity and greater returns of investment.
With the incoming 2022 Philippine General Elections, Filipinos are in the middle of a crossroad. Voters are duty-bound to decide whether Philippine society should allow itself to continue to be deluded by the promises and one-liners of certain candidates supported by the wokes, or not. If the Philippines is indeed on the path towards economic prosperity, it would be counter-intuitive to elect these woke-supported politicians because the kind of economic growth that they would approve of would be extractive and unsustainable, where these financial gains will be enjoyed not by the great masses of the people, but by the aforementioned elites. A preview to this can be seen in the on-going degeneration of contemporary American society.
Numerous social scientists rang the alarms over the United States’ decaying political and economic situation. American politics is increasingly becoming more polarized, pitting the conservative Republicans against the liberal Democrats, where centrists can no longer win elections, thus turning the elephant more to the right and the donkey, more to the left. The gap between the affluent and the poor has been widening and deepening. The woke movement has exacerbated these problems, believing in the fallacy that limiting freedom yields accountability.
The Philippines shouldn’t fall victim to nor dwell on the likes of identity politics and cancel culture, specially with the elections coming this May. Ordinary Filipinos have been provided a golden opportunity to come in sync as one voice in forging inclusive institutions. Thus, it is imperative for the Philippine electorate to choose candidates who are dedicated to genuine nation-building and move on from the chilling effects of ostracism, which are directly or indirectly perpetrated by these delusional wokes.",Politics
Are the Yellowtards and communists capable of assassinating Bongbong Marcos?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/are-the-yellowtards-and-communists-capable-of-assassinating-bongbong-marcos/,"News of an assassination plot against administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is making waves. The plot was reportedly uncovered on TikTok. On TikTok. Sounds ridiculous of course but then supporters of Marcos’s rivals in the Opposition aren’t exactly the brightest of the lot. It’s like this most recent video of Leni Robredo doing the “finger heart” gesture like an idiot that went viral on the Net recently. It seems to have been made as part of the same shoot of that  equally-idiotic Hadouken video that came out November last year.
The point is that much as the Yellowtards and communists try to keep their internal operations and conversations under wraps, there will always be the the odd idiot or two among their lot who just has to put something out on social media. As an old pal aptly puts it, KSP is the root of all evil. Another video possibly coming from the same production that, by now, is widely-recognised to have been astoundingly ill-advised somehow making it into social media again could be just the tip of the iceberg. A trove of rotten plans and initiatives — including, perhaps, an assassination plot or two, or three — may lay hidden behind the closed doors of the Yellow and Red camps of the Opposition, just a social media KSP away from being exposed.
An assassination plot is something that is hard to put past the strategists of the Yellowtards and communists. Over the last six to eight months, after all, they have tried everything to sink the BBM juggernaut. From traditional garden-variety demonisation, international demolition jobs, disqualification petitions, and debate baiting, the Yellowtards and communists have tried it. Yet they have so far failed to gain any ground. Marcos remains set to bag this year’s elections and, guess what, only death could stop him now.
Last week’s forming of an alliance between the commies and the Yellowtards is an interesting development. This is effectively the prayerful “good guys” getting in bed with people who are associated with the terrorist New People’s Army. Members of both groups would be hard-pressed to deny that they wish Marcos dead. It is difficult to imagine that, within their chi chi echo chambers, assassination hasn’t been brought up even at least once over the last 12 months.
A Second Marcos presidency is, indeed, unthinkable — if you are a Yellowtard or communist, that is. The loss of face would be inconceivable. Put yourself in the shoes of a bunch of people who’ve only known a world that sees them as the “good guys” and the Marcoses as the bad — no, evil — guys and you could at least begin to understand how so upside down and inside out the world has become for these bozos. So unnerving, perhaps, as to consider that final solution.
Just like how their pals thought the Hadouken and Finger Heart videos where good ideas at the time, assassinating Bongbong Marcos may be a temptingly good idea to them now. Same thinking applied to the same problem — preventing a Marcos return to Malacanang. Filipinos deserve an Opposition that think a bit further ahead than that — not just further ahead but differently. Surely, one might be tempted to think, assassinating Bongbong Marcos is too hideous a thought even for people like the Yellowtards and communists. Then again, look at Leni Robredo’s Hadouken and Finger Heart videos and the question “What were they thinking?” so naturally jumps out. How could they have even thought of coming up with such videos?",Politics
Angelica Panganiban video “teaching” Filipino voters to think critically actually insults their intelligence,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/angelica-panganiban-video-teaching-filipino-voters-to-think-critically-actually-insults-their-intelligence/,"In her latest video pushed out to millions of others by no less than Pinoy Big Brother alumna Bianca Gonzalez, showbiz starlet Angelica Panganiban shares some of her original insight on the sort of thinking Filipino Voters ought to be applying when choosing their candidate for the upcoming elections.
https://twitter.com/iamsuperbianca/status/1488489013535076353
Panganiban’s message is ironic because celebrity endorsements (whether that be of a product or an idea) are meant to evoke an emotional response and don’t necessarily reach their audience’s higher intellectual faculties — the ones used for critical thinking. Many are quick to point out that the idea of voting “wisely” is not new and Panganiban is merely “reminding” everyone of this important aspect of exercising one’s democratic duty this coming May. However, the fact is, there is a reason Panganiban lending weight to this trite idea (and fellow celebs like Gonzalez further anointing these artefacts) is important. It is because celebrities possess the personal gravitas to evoke the strongest emotional responses from the most number of people. This is why they earn the big bucks.
Filipinos should “vote wisely” because, I, Angelica Panganiban, said so. This is basically how the starlet comes across to her audience who, in turn, lap it all up with glee. They are, after all, not called “fantards” for nothing. The reality of the human condition is that the inclination to defer to a person of perceived authority on a subject matter is instinctive. This is why cults are prevalent and why religion remains such a powerful organising force. Celebrities are cults of personality and fandoms are fundamentally religions at their core. Fans effectively protect their idols from any scrutiny that may boomerang on them. They do this with a fervour that is can also be observed in how religious zealots go on “crusades” to further the greater glories of their gods.
By presuming to preach the merits of critical thinking when making choices, Panganiban invites scrutiny. Thus the obvious question is raised: Does this starlet have enough credibility to lecture people on the science of making rational choices? In the above video, for example, Panganiban advises the madla to “closely examine those who seek to earn your affections”. When said in Tagalog as Pangilinan does in the video — “kilatising mabuti ang mga manliligaw” — this alludes to romantic relationships.
Do recall, however, that Pangilinan wasn’t as lucid as she she is now when referring to her own experience with men. Just last year, Pangilinan shared this rather incoherent account of her personal struggles with matters of the heart and the sorts of angst these caused her.
“Parang di ko alam kasi sumuko din naman ako. Umabot din naman ako sa point na ayoko na. Parang nakakapagod na rin yung relasyon. Magsisimula ka na naman, kikilalanin mo, e-estimahin mo, pakikisamahan mo so parang hay nakakapagod yan tapos hindi mo alam kung ano yung pinapasok mo, eto na ba yun or masasaktan ka lang ulit? Para kang tumatalong… para kang mag-bu-bungee jumping or tatalon ka sa eroplano, ganun yung pakiramdam niya na parang, wala kung hindi ko ito gagawin manghihinayang ako. Choice siya eh. Lahat naman tayo may choice. Parang, ano bang gusto mo? Masaya ka na mag-isa o masaya ka na meron kang kasama?” Angelica Panganiban said.
All that might make a bit more sense (to some extent) when translated in English:
“It’s like I did not know, I too surrendered. It got to a point that I did not want anymore. Relationships have become exhausting. You start again, you get to know, you size them up, you work at getting along; it’s a lot of effort and yet you still don’t know what you are getting into. Is this where you get hurt again? It’s like a leap of fate; like bungee jumping or jumping off an airplane. That’s how it feels like; like, if you don’t do it you’ll end up regretting not doing it. It’s a choice, see. All of us have choices; like, what do you really want? Are you happy alone or are you happy being with someone?”
Not quite a lucid take on the human condition, right? It’s a far cry from the contrived, scripted confidence she exudes in that politically-motivated video making waves all over social media today. Panganiban, after all, is an actress — evidently one who is good at memorising scripts but, perhaps, not as articulate when thinking on the fly. This is the whole trouble with the Yellowtard campaign. Filipinos see through the bells and whistles its strategists use as a smokescreen to mask the reality that it is all but bankrupt of substance and authenticity. One thing Panganiban’s performance in the video succeeds at is in capturing the essence of the character of the Yellowtard campaign so well.",Politics
Every additional “presidential forum” media circus makes it even clearer why Bongbong Marcos should avoid them,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/every-additional-presidential-forum-media-circus-makes-it-even-clearer-why-bongbong-marcos-should-avoid-them/,"Watching the “presidential forum” organised by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipias (KBP) this morning makes one really understand why hooking administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos into this and other media circuses is such a big deal for their organisers and Opposition “thought leaders”. Left to grandstand among themselves and compete for Second Place in this year’s elections, the Opposition nuisance candidates only make it more evident to all why none of them should be president.
After just two such shows skipped by Marcos, a pattern is already emerging. Much of the time of these shows is spent on non-debatable no-brainer “issues” — stuff that any politician will likely not differ in position significantly to the other. These are “issues” like poverty, job creation, and basic services. When you get a whole bunch of undifferentiated bozos in a room pandering to the “plight” of “the poor”, it gets boring really fast. Do Filipinos really want to listen to a bunch of clowns “promising” to put “the poor” first in their list of priorities? Very likely not. This is why shows like Pinoy Big Brother, not charity and public service documentaries, are the big hits on TV.
More importantly, there are some emerging signs that “helping the poor” no longer works as campaign fodder. Beyond the fact that there are just too many presidential hopefuls promising to “help the poor” if they are elected president, it seems more like the electorate have set their sights on loftier goals like building a better and greater country. The fact that President Rodrigo Duterte’s splurge on infrastructure, the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ on-going buildup of firepower and fighting capability, and a tolerance for casualties in what is looking to be a successful war on drugs and criminality seem to be behind his solid trust and approval ratings indicating that Filipino voters have higher aspirations nowadays.
Simply put, none of these Opposition candidates are exhibiting any semblance of a vision of a Great Philippines in any of their messaging. For these sad Opposition candidates, it’s all about what the Philippines should not be “again”, preventing someone from becoming president, and reminding their constituents of how the old ways are better. Most of them profess to be progressive liberals but are generally imprisoned by their religious fundamentalism. These are not leaders of the Philippines of tomorrow and certainly not the sorts fit to guide their country over the next six years.
Would Marcos’s presence in today’s KBP circus have made it a better show? Definitely. These elections are, after all, a race between Marcos and all the rest. A show featuring only one side of the contest quite simply falls flat. It’s like watching a basketball game where only one team showed up and its team members forced to play against one another just so the show went on.",Politics
Why Bongbong Marcos’s rise to power mirrors Korean boy band BTS’s rise to fame,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/why-bongbong-marcoss-rise-to-power-mirrors-korean-boy-band-btss-rise-to-fame/,"In his PhilSTAR article “Could there be a Pinoy BTS?” today, Boo Chanco longingly beholds the rise of boy band BTS to astounding heights of fame, in the process doing its country proud, contributing billions to its economy, and putting South Korea at the top tiers of the planet’s cultural map. To further punctuate his Korea envy, he recalls the words of his “mentor” Bernie Villegas who points out that “person for person, Filipinos are more creative than practically every Asian country, including South Korea.” Chanco and his mentor exhibit what is really an age-old Pinoy condition — the idea that natural endowment alone is an entitlement to success and prosperity.
To be fair, Chanco consults with another friend Lisa Guerrero Nakpil who is likely better-qualified to comment on the matter having been a manager of the Filipino band RiverMaya. She gives a starker prognosis of the Philippines’ ability to mimic the success of the South Korean K-Pop phenomenon…
“I have studied this for several decades ever since the Korean juggernaut first reared its head. BTS is just the FINAL/latest flowering of South Korea’s efforts.
“This is grounded on the following:
“1. Long term planning: cultivation of talent over a 10 to 15 year horizon. Talents are picked, trained from ages eight to 12 and kept in almost military boot camps.
“2. Support of government in creative industries – tax breaks, travel, training.
“3. Korean people’s own character of hard work and perfectionism.
“I’ve had to perform with a Korean boy band and they do not quit, they keep rehearsing and working.
“I’m not surprised. Not at all accidental.
Not accidental. Success — as in the sort of consistent repeatable success — of Korean K-Pop which goes beyond BTS to include other global phenomena such as Psy of “Gangnam Style” fame, BLACKPINK, etc. is never accidental. It is engineered on the back of long-term vision as Nakpil points out. That well of human talent Villegas sighs about is no different to the Philippines’ natural resources, its fertile soil and the minerals buried beneath it. These don’t just bubble up for the picking (or fall from the proverbial mango tree into people’s gaping mouths). Resources are mined, developed, and turned into products for which there is a global demand for such as the way rich countries (which, by the way also started as dirt poor as any other) do. The alternative is to export these raw, straight off the earth or that proverbial tree — as what Third World countries like the Philippines habitually do.
So with that as context, on to the point.
Why is Bongbong Marcos like BTS? Simple — because, except for Point 2, the manner with which he got to where he is in the political scene today fits the criteria for success laid out by Nakpil in describing BTS’s and other K-Pop acts’ rise to prominence. It was a long-haul slog: more than 30 years in the making marked by modest successes along the way and he had the character to sustain this effort. Like what Nakpil cited, Marcos does not quit. Indeed, Point 2 notably excepted: Marcos did not have any backing other than that of the base of supporters he cobbled together practically person-by-person, town-by-town, province-by-province. He was, after all, the “son of the dictator” as his rivals gleefully — to the point of obsolescence — point out. Except for a handful of courageous souls, no media personality or celebrity would touch him with a ten-foot pole. Marcos’s success was all his and that of his base of loyal followers who were consistent in their commitment to his vision rain or shine.
Compare this to the floundering campaign of Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo. The ill-thought-out nature of her branding, the fragmented character of her base of supporters, and the desperate incoherence of her messaging reveal the failure of her political machine to turn her into an overnight success. Robredo’s campaign is to Marcos’s as gambling is to professional investing. Team Robredo (if one can even call them a “team”) sought a quick buck for a pwede-na-yan effort. Indeed, one could even say the Robredo campaign is a dishonest effort reminiscent of the Pinoy way of doing business — trying to scam people into buying a mediocre undifferentiated product.
Do Filipinos want to be as successful as South Korea? Or Japan? Or Germany? Note that all of these countries — at the top of their games globally today — were once bomb-cratered losers of devastating wars. There is no other way to recover from such devastation other than to clear rubble and rebuild brick-by-brick. Between Marcos and Robredo, which of the two is likely to lead the Philippines down the same path South Korea, Japan, and Germany took to get to where they are today? Which of the two is more likely to produce that “Pinoy BTS” that Chanco dreams of? The answer to that question is quite obvious.",Politics
Various Opposition factions led by the Yellowtards and communists are trying to out-WOKE each other,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/various-opposition-factions-led-by-the-yellowtards-and-communists-are-trying-to-out-woke-each-other/,"It seems that amongst the warring factions of the Opposition, the contest seems to be about who is the wokest of the lot. The bickering between the Yellowtards and the communists, for example, was about who is really genuinely against the anti-terror law. They quibble over the oxymoronic notion of a “humane” counter-insurgency program. And despite supposedly sharing a common hatred for “fascism”, they are not above accusing the other of being an “enabler” at even the slightest hint of an inclination towards heavier handed approaches to dealing with the country’s most pressing social issues.
Virtue signalling seems to be the main competitive currency amongst parties within the Opposition. It is always about who is the most “helpful” to “the poor”. It’s like they scramble over one another to mount all sorts of “feeding” and dole-out initiatives that alleviate the many miseries of the wretched. Many observe that they do this with the intent to outdo the other in some sort of wokeness contest before the cameras. This race to the bottom seems to account for the increasingly ridiculous stunts to prove who is the downest to the earthest. Who cooks the most nutritionally-bankrupt dish and who delivers the most baduy dance moves. The assumption that seems to underlie these stunts is that the masses demand mediocre products to be assured of authenticity.
The approach to reach out to and engage with the masa being employed by the Yellowtards — specifically Robredo’s “KakamPink” campaign today — seems to follow the Eat Bulaga template of overt working-class entertainment meant to give a “home” to the C and D classes. This may have worked in the early days following the “restoration” of “democracy” (or so we are told) in 1986 following that “revolution”. Back then, the idea of erstwhile high-up-there politicians and officials hamming it up with the hoi polloi was still a novelty which made stunts involving contrived down-to-earthedness effective mind tricks in political campaigns.
Evidently Robredo’s strategists have failed to gauge just how much the Philippine electorate had matured since and how ineffective these tricks have now become. The communists, for their part, have remained consistent with their extremist worker-is-king dogma and, as such, likely take offense at the Yellowtard maka-masa act that comes across to them as a disgusting perversion of their ideology.
Bottom line is that the Opposition seem to have lost sight of their formidable “enemy” and are, instead, expending precious energy and time bickering among themselves. Imagine what it would be like if these bozos were in power. The orgy of mutual sniping and out-woking then continues. And Filipinos will, yet again, be left sitting outside of those chi chi echo chambers within which the the best humblebraggers and the loudest ambag-givers crown themselves toasts of the town.",Politics
Maria Ressa apologists dismiss online “trolling” of her Nobel “Peace Prize” acceptance speech as “fake”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/maria-ressa-apologists-dismiss-online-trolling-of-her-nobel-peace-prize-acceptance-speech-as-fake/,"Opposition “thought leaders” like communist “journalist” Inday Espina Varona take a typical position on the Filipino public’s response to Rappler CEO Maria Ressa’s junket to Oslo, Norway to receive her Nobel “Peace Prize”. It seems that comments flooding social media accounts and posts associated with Ressa’s award expressing disagreement with the occasion had been significant enough to prompt Varona to react. However, rather than accord some benefit of the doubt that a good proportion of these online reactions reflect a big enough subset of Filipino public sentiment, Varona was outright dismissive.
Those trolling the Nobel page & accounts featuring Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize aren’t causing her embarrassment. They’re graphic evidence of the toxic sludge linked to disinformation campaigns by abusive states and enablers among rapacious tech firms#HoldTheLine #CourageOn
— inday espina varona (@indayevarona) December 11, 2021
How does Varona simply conclude that all this online commentary that does not fit her preferred narrative of Ressa being God’s Gift to Philippine Journalism are all the work of “trolls” who form the “toxic sludge linked to disinformation campaigns by abusive states and enablers”? It seems Varona is guilty of the very behaviours of the average “consumer of mass disinformation” her kind disdain as she herself uncritically regurgitates sound bytes from Ressa’s acceptance speech (full text here) to adorn the above tweet.
Varona conveniently omits important context when she summarily jumps into conclusions like these — that an overwhelming majority of eligible Filipino voters do not subscribe to the view she and her cadre of Maria Ressa cheerleaders are propagating. This is evident in survey after survey over the last couple of years showing that Filipinos remain supportive of Duterte’s government. In recent months, these same reputable survey firms have issued reports clearly showing that Filipino voters are set to elect “the dictator’s son” Bongbong Marcos and The Enabled’s daughter Sara Duterte to the presidency and vice presidency come May 2022.
Given these facts, Varona should apply a bit more circumspection the next time she parrots Ressa’s ululations lest she falsely accuses hundreds of thousands — possibly millions — of Filipino social media users as collectively forming mere “sludge” in what are essentially public fora. She should, like the way she preaches in those “webinars” she gets invited to grace, at least be a bit critical of what she consumes from the Net, right? This is specially in considering that those “peace prizes” are artifacts invented by the very Western European powers her comrades in that “people’s revolution” we keep hearing about being waged in the Philippine countryside rail about for their continued “imperialist” oppression that victimise the peoples of the Third World.
Here’s Maria Ressa in all her ad nauseum glory playing to the chi chi crowd in Oslo…
I didn’t know if I was going to be here today. Every day, I live with the real threat of spending the rest of my life in jail because I’m a journalist. When I go home, I have no idea what the future holds, but it’s worth the risk.
“No idea what that future holds”? Ressa need only (1) consult her lawyers with regard to the prospects of her winning the legal cases she faces once she returns and (2) be a real journalist and put her ear on the ground to get a good picture of the political landscape taking shape in her “home”. Perhaps she can gain enough information to implement some overdue updates to her little playbook and make the public statements she makes about this “home” a bit less insulting to her supposed compatriots. Then maybe she will get better more flattering comments from Filipino social media users. Perhaps then, parrots like Inday Espina Varona will start squawking less lies.",Politics
"According to the Yellowtards, Leni Robredo MUST win. How exactly is a mystery.",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/according-to-the-yellowtards-leni-robredo-must-win-how-exactly-is-a-mystery/,"Yellowtards soldier on despite the odds of a victory. Credit them for that. Some clues as to what exactly fuels this remarkable persistence is in a tweet recently fielded by their chief “economist” JC Punongbayan.
According to Punongbayan, the possibility of Robredo suffering a loss in May 2022 is unacceptable. Well, golly gee, that’s an interesting one. That’s like buying a lottery ticket and expecting to win a million bucks. It’s like a Robredo win is an entitlement the Yellowtards are exclusive heirs to. Stop and think about this for a moment. Campaign for Leni Robredo under the premise that she must win. It’s like Punongbayan is inventing an entire new sort of mathematics to support his personal beliefs on the matter.
Well, fair enough. Believing in the product is essential to mounting a convincing campaign to sell it. The surrounding context to Punongbayan’s declaration of a Robredo win as fact is the recent Bongbong Marcos – Sara Duterte motorcade that graced Quezon City the other day and attracted a massive crowd. It is as if Punongbayan beheld that sight shook his head and thought, this is unacceptable, then tapped out his tweet.
So, okay, fine. Robredo must win. Say, for argument’s sake, it is so. The obvious next question is this: How do the Yellowtards plan to make good on that edict? This is where it gets interesting. Mounting a better campaign seems to be out of the question. Despite numerous gaffes and ill-thought-out stunts falling flat, there is no sign that the sissy KakamPink character of Robredo’s campaign will change strategically anytime soon. Robredo exhibiting a bit more statesmanship in her demeanor? Possible but quite the tall order. Robredo is unable to string together a coherent thought stream in any language, much less English. Scratch that one too.
This leaves outright removing Bongbong Marcos from the race — either by disqualifying him or cancelling his Certificate of Candidacy. But will removing BBM mean that Robredo will win? Say again, for argument’s sake, that a large chunk of votes that would have gone to BBM went to Robredo instead and, as a result, racked up the most number of votes in these elections which means she gets to be President. In that unlikely scenario, would one consider Robredo the winner? If you were a Yellowtard, yes.
Thing is, most Filipinos aren’t Yellowtards. Robredo may become president if her henchwomen succeed at removing BBM from these elections. But she will not, by any stretch of the imagination, be seen to have won these elections. For that matter any one of the Opposition candidates may become president if BBM were not in the picture. But none of them would be winners.
Good luck then with the personal arithmetic that you apply to your call to action, Mr. Punongbayan. Perhaps the lot of you will find a way to make Robredo President of the Philippines. But making her actually win these elections is something you people will not succeed at.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s IMPOSSIBLE promise to regain public trust in government: Filipinos trust her LESS than President Duterte!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/leni-robredos-impossible-promise-to-regain-public-trust-in-government-filipinos-trust-her-less-than-president-duterte/,"“Ibalik ang tiwala sa gobyerno,” (“Regain public trust in the government”) says Leni Robredo in her most recent campaign video where she lays out her plan to provide “jobs for all”.
One wonders though. If Robredo’s pitch is to regain public trust in the Philippine Government, the question is, is she the right person to make good on such a promise? According to the latest Publicus Asia report, Pahayag Q4, incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte continued to maintain a trust rating of around 55 percent — more than twice Robredo’s 23 percent rating this quarter. This is corroborated by another metric exhibited in the Pahayag report showing that about 68 percent of survey respondents believe that the country is “headed in the right direction”.
On what basis then does Robredo presume to promise an uplift in public trust in the government if the public trusts her less than the incumbent? Robredo’s impossible promise makes even less sense when considering her, yet again, dismal showing in the popularity section of the Pahayag survey which is an indicator of her ability to win the coming national elections. Her rival and top presidential bet Bongbong Marcos enjoys a 52 percent preference rating this quarter up from 49 percent last quarter and still dwarfing Robredo’s whose rating slipped from 21 to 20 percent over the same period.
Clearly Robredo and her campaign team need a serious reality check (if this latest report still does not put a rocket up their asses). They continue to believe they will overtake Team Marcos – Sara Duterte over the remaining five months of the campaign (and delude their supporters into thinking the same), yet there is no evidence nor data to back their optimistic appraisal of their situation.
Indeed, Robredo’s only chance of winning these elections is if her minions succeed at removing Marcos Jr. from the race through disqualification or cancellation of his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC). If she wins by default it is likely that Filipinos will be even less trusting of her government and, over her six-year term will only see her as the person who deprived them of the person who should have been president. Robredo and her camp need to face the facts. There is no way they can win — even if she succeeds at becoming the next President of the Philippines.",Politics
"Philippine energy policy: more politics, less economics",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/philippine-energy-policy-more-politics-less-economics/,"Human civilizations have witnessed and experienced various ups and downs, which ranged from progress, stagnation, to dissolution. These various epochs have been etched in our world history, but the impact of the industrial revolution undoubtedly shaped how we spend our lives for the past couple of centuries. Industrialization began in Britain, where there was a transformation of the British economy. The aforementioned economy was predominantly agriculture-based, but through the industrial revolution, manufacturing flourished and started to contribute significantly  locally and, eventually, beyond the British Isles. Socially, families initially residing in the country’s rural areas migrated to larger cities, in search of better pastures. Scientists continue to debate both the causes and consequences of industrialization, but the industrial age has nonetheless spurred the global economy’s appetite for steel, coal, and oil.
Both coal and oil are fossil fuels that release tremendous amounts of energy when burned. This energy can be utilized to generate electricity, which enabled us to achieve productivity levels that support modern-day economies which, in turn, have improved the living standards of many societies. This dependency is mirrored in the various sectors of the economy. Tourism cannot flourish if airplanes don’t fly and burn jet fuel. Construction companies cannot generate employment opportunities if asphalt and cement aren’t readily available. Even the health sector cannot deliver quality service if their state-of-the-art machines have no electricity access. Financially wealthy nations have greatly depended on electricity generated by burning these hydrocarbons. Newly industrialized countries are following suit.
Needless to say, use of these non-renewable energy resources is at a crossroads. A myriad of issues have arisen covering anywhere from climate change to the motions of the global market. With various international discussions tackling carbon emissions, net zero has been the buzzword in the recent Conference of the Parties (COP26) held in Glasgow, Scotland. It called for government intervention to address the threats of increasing average global temperatures by investing aggressively in renewable energy sources and cost-effective technologies that would hopefully pave the way for a decarbonized society.
However, the realities seem to be formidable as the demand for “dinosaur juice” in the global market is on the rise as countries begin to open up their economies. In addition, investments in oil have been dropping resulting in a looming crunch in supply in the market. Basic economics would tell that a decrease in supply coupled with an increase in demand will put upward pressure on prices. Oil cartels like the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) serve as obstacles, as these petrostates are greatly dependent on these hydrocarbons in keeping their respective economies running. This has led the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India, and China to release a portion of their state-owned stockpiled oil to the market in an attempt to keep prices down.
With the hydrocarbon market’s volatility and unpredictability, the Philippines always ends up a perennial victim of rising oil prices. As a consumption-based economy, all consumers in the archipelago end up shouldering its costs impacts to food, transportation, and other services. Electricity bills have also been a headache to Filipino households, as it is well-known that electricity rates in the Philippines are one of the highest in the Asia Pacific region which, in turn, increases the operating costs of various businesses contributing to a lowering of the country’s economic competitiveness in the region. What should be done to address such predicaments? These require multi-faceted solutions.
The first thing is to utilize nuclear energy by upgrading and modernizing the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. Pragmatism is the name of the game if we are to provide a decent answer to our energy needs, and nuclear power addresses them effectively. Even though the nuclear plant was constructed during the Marcos years, it is in the interest of every Filipino that it be run safely and through modern means. Careful re-activation should resolve a significant majority of these safety-related issues. In addition, nuclear power provides cheap electricity while releasing virtually zero carbon to the atmosphere, which aids the country in achieving the lofty carbon-neutral goal in a few decades. As long as proper operation standards are observed, nuclear energy will definitely boost the nation’s economic output.
Second is to tap the latent renewable energy potential of the country’s geography. As the Philippines is blessed with volcanoes, strong winds, and large bodies of water, utilizing geothermal power, wind power, and hydropower will lessen the nation’s dependency on these hydrocarbons. Making parts of the country as test subjects in harnessing wave energy, which is currently under development, will aid in making the Philippines become the poster child of sustainable energy in Asia Pacific. The wind turbines of Ilocos Norte serve as a notable starting point, if the Philippines is indeed serious in maximizing these renewable sources of energy.
Finally, continuous investment in the energy sector both from the government and private entities is imperative. A number of the country’s power plants are ageing and run inefficiently, particularly those that were built during the Marcos administration. Simply mothballing much-needed energy infrastructure projects would run counter to accomplishing energy security, specially considering that building power-generating capacity from scratch cannot be done overnight. As long as the costs incurred in constructing, maintaining, and operating these power plants are recoupable and can generate profit in the long run, these investments are worth considering.
All three of these approaches are feasible in the Philippine context, only if we let economics work instead of wasting resources on political bickering, political vendetta, and political posturing. Consistency to execute the country’s energy policy must go beyond political maneuvering because energy security is vital to the national interest and affects millions of Filipinos. If the Philippines is indeed bound to expand its economy, satisfying the citizens’ appetite for affordable, readily available, and environmentally-friendly energy is a prerequisite.
As such, electing a presidential candidate for the 2022 general elections who has a platform and the background to address the country’s energy needs is of paramount importance. Quoting Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck; politics is the art of the possible. Hopefully, all the presidentiables who are knocking at the doors of Malacanang would use their political capital to attain energy security for the Philippines.",Politics
"Yellowtards tell Filipino voters: If you are not with us, you are against God",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/yellowtards-tell-filipino-voters-if-you-are-not-with-us-you-are-against-god/,"It’s not exactly a sight that you’d expect to see in this day and age and in this era of “my body my choice” rhetoric trumping the old your-body-is-God’s-property teachings of Roman Catholicism — the religion of fear and guilt. Yet, on exhibit today is a major bloc of the Philippine Opposition — “vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo’s people — marching behind an image of the Virgin Mary the way medieval crusaders used to.
https://twitter.com/terio_garcia/status/1492679736245383173
What is it exactly that Robredo and her Yellowtard army are trying to tell us? It seems as if they aim to exploit an old primal fear in the hearts of Catholic Filipinos. Hey look at us, we march in honour of Mama Mary. If you are against us, you are against the virgin mother of our lord Jesus Christ. Come between us and our goal to seize power and you risk invoking the wrath of the Almighty.
The use of the Virgin Mary as a prop in a dishonest campaign stunt perpetrated by the Yellowtards also raises some confronting questions regarding their ideology. Recall that the pink theme of the Yellowtards this year aims to appeal to feminists and the gay community. So does Mama Mary represent what these communities stand for?
No less than the Pope himself seems to be confused about the position the Church takes on the matter of gay rights and issues. The New York Times in its article “Pope Sends More Mixed Messages on L.G.B.T.Q. Rights” published last year reports…
Nearly eight years after Pope Francis famously responded, “Who am I to judge?” on the issue of gay Catholics, it has become increasingly difficult to discern where he stands on the issue. A growing dissonance has developed between his inclusive language and the church’s actions.
The result is confusion and frustration among some of the pope’s liberal supporters who wonder whether the 84-year-old Argentine remains committed to a more tolerant church and is simply struggling to grasp the rapidly shifting contours of a difficult issue, or is really a social conservative trying to please everyone.
Publication of the above article follows an earlier report that the Vatican’s foreign minister Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher expressed opposition to a bill that “would add L.G.B.T. provisions to an existing law that makes discrimination, violence or incitement based on race or religion a crime punishable by up to four years in prison.” The Guardian reported back then in its piece “Vatican urges Italy to stop proposed anti-homophobia law” that a letter delivered by Gallagher “argued that the anti-homophobia law called into question the church’s ‘freedom of organisation’ and threatened ‘freedom of thought’ among Catholics”.
One wonders then what it is exactly that the camp of Leni Robredo and her sidekick Kiko Pangilinan stand for. Are they really serious about being advocates of the causes of feminism and the gay community? Or are they just using the Church and are exploiting religious Filipinos’ primal fear of eternal damnation as a means to achieve their political ends?
All this goes into further demonstrating just how dishonest the Yellowtard campaign is. Robredo and Pangilinan are grossly-misleading Filipinos into thinking that God is on “their side” and that they are the “good” in a made-up battle between “good” and “evil” in these elections. It’s high time Filipinos move on from these sorts of primitive campaign tactics and apply more critical minds to the important choices they make as participants in a modern democratic process.",Politics
Yellowtards expected a rumble but SMNI News delivered rare CONVERSATION and a chance for the better candidates to be heard,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/yellowtards-expected-a-rumble-but-smni-news-delivered-rare-conversation-and-a-chance-for-the-better-candidates-to-be-heard/,"The biggest losers in last night’s debate at Okada Manila organised by SMNI News were the top Opposition aspirants for Second Place — Leni Robredo, Isko Moreno, Manny Pacquiao, and Ping Lacson. They missed out on an event that drew eyeballs and opened the door to presidential candidates that had for so long been unceremoniously omitted by Big Corporate Media. It was a breath of fresh air for Filipino voters jaded and weary of the vacuous ululations of crybabies who do nothing but whine about “the Martial Law Years”, “trolls”, “fake news”, misogyny, attacks on “press freedom”, and not doing enough to “help the poor”. Cleared of all the noise of Yellowtardism and scare mongering over a “return to tyranny”, the event opened a space for conversation about the truly important issues that keep ordinary Filipinos awake at night.
Not surprisingly, Opposition partisans were disappointed. They were expecting communist presidential candidate Leodegario “Ka Leody” Quitain de Guzman to “tear Marcos apart” in what would have, if they had their way, been more of a bardagulan (rumble) among participants. Instead, the panel did a good job fielding the sorts of questions fit for presidential candidates and fielded them equally amongst the participating candidates which included De Guzman, administration candidate Bongbong Marcos, former national security adviser Norberto Gonzales, and former presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella. In essence, apart from Marcos who already enjoys a huge lead over the rest, as various surveys conducted by reputable polling firms suggest, all participants had lots to gain from this event and came out winners.
As for the expected grilling that Opposition Yellowtards and communists expected Marcos to cop, well, he did get it, but not from their “representative” of the moment on this occasion. Marcos — like all his fellow participants — was put through the wringer by the esteemed panelists which included, among others, University of the Philippines Professor Clarita Carlos, Manila Times chairman Dante Ang, former 5th District congressman and former vice governor Rolex Suplico, and SMNI journalist MJ Mondejar. The grillings the panel delivered equally across the four participants — credit to the moderation chops of host Karen Jimeno — effectively extinguishes accusations of “bias” thrown by Opposition “thought leaders” at SMNI News and the panelists of this event. Indeed, one can easily glean the dishonest intent in the mission Ka Leody was expected by his Opposition cheerleaders to accomplish last night in the sorts of commentary fielded on Twitter.
Evidently, the Yellowtards and commies would have preferred a chaotic free-for-all instead of the discussion among gentlemen that was on exhibit last night. This likely reflects on the candidates who skipped this occasion and ended up looking like cowardly chumps. That their supporters would egg Ka Leody to behave like a buffoon and run roughshod over the forum rules of the event just to be able to take a swing at one of the participants speaks lots about the character of the bloc of the Opposition represented by Robredo, Moreno, Pacquiao, and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Lacson.
To be fair, Ka Leody acted like a gentleman that night — perhaps because he was in the company of the same. He did so even when the hairy topic of communist terrorism was raised. Nonetheless, he was clearly out of his depth in the company of his fellow participants. Whereas the others were able to explore the topic from a broad perspective, Ka Leody only had his extremist ideology to work with. The manner with which he justified armed rebellion and terrorism only highlighted the elephant in the room that traditional Big Corporate Media routinely tiptoes around with regard to a communist presidential candidate — the reality that a guy like Ka Leody or any communist-backed candidate for that matter will likely not have really thought through what it means to be President of the Philippines and the commander-in-chief of its military forces. To which army will Ka Leody owe his loyalties to? The terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) the armed “revolution” of which he evidently supports? How exactly can he fulfil his presidential role if he is a supporter of armed rebellion?
Of course the communist camp are not lacking a bench full of university kiddies supporting the lie that is the “people’s revolution” they insist is being waged by the NPA in the hinterlands. This sentiment is captured by Ateneo-trained “sociologist”, “outstanding scientist”, and Rappler “journalist” Jayeel Cornelio who is quick to defend Ka Leody’s pony show last night.
Indeed, one subtle thing achieved by this SMNI event is that it gave Filipinos the opportunity to see first-hand these elections’ communist candidate letting rip his views on what a communist regime really intends for the Philippines. Ka Leody had no specifics to offer on what his foreign affairs architecture might look like. For that matter he had no specifics on just about everything a president needs to wrap his head around and get on top of as the Philippines’ chief executive over the next six years. There was nothing Ka Leody could articulate that falls outside the narrow script that his crooked ideology allows him to draw from. As such, Ka Leody is no different to that group of pals he had been conscripted to “represent” last night — merely pretending to be “inclusive” but only within the terms of his obsolete communist orthodoxy.
The Opposition were loudly hoping that this debate would turn around their fortunes either (1) because Marcos would be left looking like a chump in an empty debate hall after their presumptuous “boycott” or (2) because their proxy Ka Leody would rip him a second one in what they thought would be an entertaining cockfight. None of those things happened last night and the Opposition were left looking even more like what this campaign have revealed their lot to be — pathetic puppets working off hollow rhetoric, keyboard brawlers lacking in grace and class, and a dishonest political force whose members harbour a perverted sense of entitlement to political power on the basis of their belief that they are the “good guys” in a battle between “good” and “evil” that is being fought only within the made-up world spun by their retarded imagination.",Politics
Opposition presidential candidates declining SMNI debate proves they are hypocrites,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/opposition-presidential-candidates-declining-smni-debate-proves-they-are-hypocrites/,"Tit for tat, right? Administration candidate Bongbong Marcos declines debates organised by media organisations GMA, KBP, and CNN so now it’s the Opposition nuisances’ turn to decline the SMNI debate that Marcos will be attending. Here is where the difference lies. Team Marcos was first to grasp the tactical genius in declining media circuses organised by wily Opposition lackeys. Thing is, that is something only a candidate leading by a massive margin can pull off.
Nuisance candidates presuming to snub a media event that will likely be their only chance to face off with Marcos? That’s like unfollowing Taylor Swift on Twitter and expecting her to be offended. Besides, Marcos had already beaten them to making snubbing media circuses look cool. As to the lame snub delivered by Leni Robredo, Manny Pacquiao, and Isko Moreno? Well, best that we defer to Cherie Gil’s famous line in the 1985 movie Bituing Walang Ningning…
You’re nothing, but a second-rate trying hard copycat!
Indeed, for a bunch of bozos competing with one another for Second Prize, declining a media event that would put them in the same room as Number One is a bad case of bitterness clouding sound strategic thinking. With just a few weeks left to campaign, and a rival with nothing to gain from participating in media circuses, there’s just no putting any sort of positive spin on the Opposition snub of the SMNI debate show.
More importantly, all this just further highlights what huge hypocrites the trying-hard copy-cats are. One would think after calling Marcos a “coward” for sidestepping an “important” event such as a “debate” these second-rate candidates would at least show they are not the very character they erstwhile paint their common rival to be. No sirreee. Once again, ill-advised by the half-wit folk who surround these bozos. This was a chance to exhibit grace and be the bigger people in this drama. Instead, they come out of it looking like even bigger chumps.",Politics
@RobyAlampay’s long-overdue question forces Yellowtards to reflect on difference between #Dilawan and #KakamPink,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/robyalampays-long-overdue-question-forces-yellowtards-to-reflect-on-difference-between-dilawan-and-kakampink/,"Journalist Roby Alampay who formerly held executive positions at BusinessWorld and the TV5 network asked a question yesterday that launched a thousand responses and plunged Yellowtardom into a fit of long-overdue introspection. Alampay posted his question on both Twitter and Facebook after which it attracted some interesting responses that revealed quite a bit about what goes on in the Yellowtard mind.
Following a quick peruse of the responses, the most common type boils down to this essence: Yellow was the colour of the Aquinos and represented “us” while Pink is the colour of a true reform movement and represents “we”. In short, the Yellowtards imagine a hard line between the Yellow of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan and the Pink of Leni Robredo. They see Yellow as exclusive and Pink as inclusive. Yellow is Aquino, Pink is Robredo. Are we starting to see the pattern here? This is the sort of response coming from members of what was once a monolithic Yellowtard community that is now divided from within into two colour-branded factions. From an outsider, however, they are all essentially Yellowtards quibbling over what, in the bigger scheme of things, are immaterial differences between two Yellowtard sub-cultures.
Alampay qualifies his question as a “serious” one. But the responses it attracted borders on hilarity. The tidal wave of funny responses can only be collectively described as a tidal wave of intellectual dishonesty. Examples to illustrate this dishonesty abound even just over the last several months. To welcome the New Year back in January, no less than Yellowtard ally Akbayan repurposed an old photo of a relatively slim Robredo posing with Akbayan honcho Risa Hontiveros for use in a campaign tweet. Akbayan evidently does not see much difference between the two colours.
Alampay’s question is all the more confronting to Yellowtards today because it is coming from one of their kind. That said, this is not a new question and is one we asked as far back as 2018 in our piece “Why do Yellowtards no longer wear the colour yellow in their rallies?“. In that article is highlighted a key reason as to why the Yellowtards take so long and miss so many lessons before they learn to come together for the sort of introspection that is routine to most normal people who are consistently self-aware.
Has the colour yellow become a taboo colour in Philippine Opposition politics? The concept that yellow had become taboo boggles the mind considering how, for more than three decades, the colour yellow was regarded by many Filipinos as a symbol of all in politics that was good.
How do we go about solving this mystery? One would think it would be a simple matter of asking a typical Yellowtard the simple question:
Why do you Yellowtards now seem to shun the colour yellow?
Perhaps it is because the typical Yellowtard would likely answer in a not-so-straightforward manner or would simply outright refuse to “dignify the question” with an answer. That’s pretty typical of a Yellowtard, to be fair. A Yellowtard would be offended by what is otherwise a pretty valid question. One’s perfectly sensible curiosity is met with a baffling defensiveness.
Furthermore, “[the] change in choice of political colour amongst Yellowtards seems to have been driven from within their ranks. Yet, because they have long shown an inclination to externalise the perceived causes of their problems, they fail to consider that, perhaps, there is something about their very nature that contributes to the failures they’ve been experiencing in recent years.” This then brings to the fore the inconvenient truth about Leni Robredo’s dilawan partisan origins and how she morphed from one colour to another over the last six to seven years like any traditional political chameleon.
The six-year colour mutation of Yellowtardom was not any one person’s brainchild but, rather, a pathetic trial-and-error journey. The colossal defeat of Liberal Party (LP) presidential candidate Mar Roxas to Rodrigo Duterte in 2016 seems to have been where it started. Robredo was part of all that being no less than the LP vice presidential candidate and Roxas’s running mate. The campaign in the lead up to those elections was totally bathed in Yellow to the point of monumental cringe.
If it weren’t for Robredo’s dubious “win” over then rival Bongbong Marcos, the LP would have been a total write-off as a political force right there and then. Still, the top “thought leaders” of Yellowtardom evidently continued believing that the yellow stain that blights their lot only needed to be whitewashed which they literally did shortly after that fiasco. That sloppy whitewash delivered an even bigger disaster to their political brand.
What were the Opposition thinking when they came up with their latest media stunt? It’s an aping of the Hunger Games salute that came across like the Nazi Sieg Heil! salute. Talk about double-whammy fail! If this was attempt at a rebranding to distance themselves from the Yellowtards, it seems they made things worse and further revealed just how confused their collective movement is.
Today, we see only the most recent flavour the Yellowtards have taken. The rise of pink as the dominant Opposition colour is a product of the very social media “effect” the Yellowtards keep whining about. Inquirer columnist Joel Ruiz Butuyan captured the spirit of this mass tingala to a dishonest brand that started it all. In his October 2021 piece “The tasks ahead for Leni supporters”, he wrote of the “dream candidate of the opposition, Vice President Leni Robredo” and how her candidacy for president “generated a stirring momentum from the moment she made the announcement”…
For three days from the day she delivered her “Lalaban ako” speech, there was a sea of pink on my Facebook wall. Many of those passionately coming out for Leni on social media are millennials. If this reflects a trend, it bodes very well for her because the youth are a huge chunk of the voting population.
Therein lies the whole trouble with the Yellowtards. Rather than listen, they behave like a Taliban-like lynch mob of book burners and censors — quick to judge, utterly lacking in imagination and curiosity, and guided only by primal tribalism. You’d think you could expect a bit more from private school Katipuneros like “journalist” Howie Severino, for example. To the late National Artist F. Sionil Jose who, at risk of being burned at the stake for his views, expressed direct opposition to Rappler CEO Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize award on Facebook last year, all the “respected” GMA News Online honcho could respond with is a lame ad hominem…
My opinion as a reader — I’ve read your books and I’ve read Maria’s books. She’s a much better writer.
Your books are hard to finish. Your dialog is stilted and unrealistic. Even your columns contain little to no insight. But I like your bookstore.
What’s the difference between a Dilawan and a KakamPink, Alampay asks? Nothing. They are both Yellowtards. Often it is the simplest explanation that tends to be the most sound one. There is no squirming about that confronting reality.",Politics
The future is not female. The future is PEOPLE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/the-future-is-not-female-the-future-is-people/,"According to Teddy Baguilat who is running for senator under Leni Robredo’s Yellowtard flag, “the future is female”. This moronic idea he pushes in a tweet he recently fielded.
Why is the future “female”? Why it’s because Robredo is a woman and, therefore, female just like her daughters. Of course, right? This is presumably why they are branding their campaign “pink” — to appeal to the idea that the Philippines is in the market for a female president. Perhaps too they take some wisdom form the late Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago who once suggested that the next Philippine president should have a vagina.
We’ve had 13 male and only two female presidents so far. The Philippines has had a total of 15 presidents. To achieve equality between males and females, since we have had 13 males, the next 11 presidents should be female.
Sige na nga, babae naman. This is basically the campaign motto of the Yellowtards. Indeed, I wrote back then, “If I were a woman, I’d feel monumentally insulted. This sort of talk is implying that a woman’s qualifications and abilities will have nothing to do with her prospects of becoming President or a Philippine senator and will, instead, be dependent on the success of this moronic appeal to peoples’ nebulous notion of what “gender equality” is all about.”
It’s hardly surprising that the Yellowtard campaign in these elections miserably failed. Rather than appeal to people, they appeal to “gender equality”. Gender equality is not a concept that is top-of-mind for most ordinary Filipinos. Rather than listen to people, the Yellowtards’ chi chi campaign “strategists” were busy exchanging high fives with their high-horsed pals in their air-conditioned echo chambers up that hill.
It’s not too late to reform the Yellowtard campaign. There is still time — or so the Yellowtards lead themselves to believe. Hence they go off and campaign harder. But are they campaigning smarter? Ask bozos like Baguilat and he’ll tell you; no need to campaign smarter… the future is female.",Politics
"Reports that more than 40,000 participants attended Yellowtard rallies in Cavite and Bulacan are all LIES",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/reports-that-more-than-40000-participants-attended-yellowtard-rallies-in-cavite-and-bulacan-are-all-lies/,"Last week saw a spate of rallies conducted by the leading Yellowtard bloc of the Philippine Opposition headed by “vice president” Leni Robredo. One which was held in Cavite boasted “47,000” participants. Another held in Bulacan Saturday boasted “45,000”. The source of both numbers was very likely the organisers themselves and, as expected, this “information” was amplified by dishonest “journalists” like Mara Cepeda of Opposition “social news network” Rappler.
WATCH: Some 45,000 Kakampinks attend the grand rally of presidential candidate VP Leni Robredo and her running mate Sen Kiko Pangilinan in Malolos, Bulacan.
Will tens of thousands of attendees become the new staple at Leni-Kiko rallies?
🎥 Team Kiko Pangilinan @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/52JIZEDtpE
— Mara Cepeda (@maracepeda) March 5, 2022
A photo featured in the Manila Bulletin “report” titled “The battle is on: 45,000 supporters pack Robredo’s grand rally in Bulacan” included the caption, “Bulacan sits in the same table with Iloilo and Cavite, as Malolos City welcomed Vice President Leni Robredo and her running mate Kiko Pangilinan with a whooping [sic] 45,000 pink-clad supporters during their campaign rally on Saturday, March 5. (Photo courtesy of Del Laddaran)”. Where the 45,000 estimate came from, as mentioned earlier, remains a mystery and it is evident neither Cepeda nor Raymund Antonio who authored the Bulletin “report” could be bothered to find an alternative source to corrobrate what they were told.
An easy approach would have been to at least use the photo included in the Bulletin “report” — or, for that matter, others shared on social media — as basis to do some quick independent estimates. The Bulletin photo shows some indication of where the edges of the crowd lie and, from that, give one an idea of the ground area within the Malolos Sports and Convention Center it occupied at the time the photo was taken.
From such a simple analysis alone, it would have been easy to see that the notion of a “45,000-strong crowd” at the Bulacan rally being bandied around by both the Yellowtards and their lackeys in Big Corporate Media is not plausible at all. [NB: the analysis approach that follows is credited to Twitter user “Sysiaco” who demonstrated it in a tweet] Even if the entire complex grounds were filled to a density of three people per square metre, these grounds could have hosted only 36,900 people. And on the basis of the projected ground area taken up by the crowd in Antonio’s Bulletin report, there could have only been 18,000 people in the event at most.
That the Yellowtards would routinely conspire with Big Corporate Media to spread misleading information about the size of their rallies — as in this instance — gives ample cause to doubt every bit of “information” they release on the outcomes of their rallies and campaign sorties. It is also further proof of the atrocious quality of “journalism” Filipinos are being subject to by what are supposed to be the largest and most prominent news organisations in the country.",Politics
The Javiers of Antique: An Example of a Political Spin-Off Franchise Gone Sour,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/the-javiers-of-antique-an-example-of-a-political-spin-off-franchise-gone-sour/,"Evelio Javier’s heroism, although still somewhat remembered, is only vaguely honored by the acts of his brother and nephew.
Except for the recent protests against Bongbong Marcos’ campaign rally at the site Evelio’s assassination, his kin’s lengthy political careers didn’t lead to a true battle that would end the poverty and corruption that was once attributed to the “evil” Marcos regime.
In fact, the Javier name had been stamped with accusations of plunder and abuse of privilege – leaving it an anemic and ghostly mere footnote in a history written by the victors of a power grab thirty five years ago.
Was It Heroism or Opportunism?
The EDSA Uprising of 1986 produced as many heroes as the number of people that crowded the major thoroughfare 36 years ago.
I could count myself as one of them, as many might have, for merely showing up with some sandwiches and bottles of water or for just standing around the vicinity wondering what all the ruckus was about.
While most people wouldn’t have an idea of what their role was beyond threatening to clog up tank tracks with their flesh should the order be made, there were those who were hyper-aware of how the flow of vast fortunes could be changing its course beneath the subterfuge of “revolution”.
I am not saying that there were opportunists everyone who switched allegiance from President Ferdinand Marcos to the junta led by Fidel Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile, but seeing the events that played out between two Aquino Presidencies one could make a strong argument that the country is ruled by Thernadiers.
Masters of the land
Always get our share
Clear away the barricades
And we’re still there!
We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell.
And when we’re rich as Croesus
Jesus! Won’t we see you all in hell!
— Beggars at the Feast, Les Miserables
One of the names that crops up in most re-tellings of the EDSA 1986 revolt is Evelio Javier, who allegedly had been gunned down by assassins hired by his political rival Arturo Pacificador.
According to Evelio’s son Gideon, who was recently interviewed on ANC, Pacificador had masterminded his father’s assassination with the blessings of former President Marcos. (You can watch his interview here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVI5c5Avprk )
Gideon claims his family never got justice for the death of his father, who is often identified in the lore of the EDSA 1986 revolt, as an anti-Marcos martyr.
Because, perhaps, just like Ninoy Aquino’s assassination, justice for Javier’s brutal killing was mangled by the inexplicable way our judicial system works – even when our courts were functioning under a more enlightened, ennobled post-Marcosian phase.
Even sadder is a video posted two years ago on Facebook of Paolo Everardo Javier, son of Exequiel the younger brother of Evelio, laying a wreath at Evelio’s statue. One would assume that one of the first martyrs of the Aquino regime and one that supposedly helped precipitate the EDSA 1986 revolt would be commemorated by a larger audience instead of being a small poignant family affair.
The question that seems right to ask is, did Antiquenos stop loving the Javiers after Evelio’s death?
I wish I could find out more about how the Javiers (Exequiel, Paolo, and others) fared as elected officials beyond the couple of news articles floating around on the internet.
It would have been relatively a good thing if Exequiel and Paolo had a bunch of boring local government news stories attached to their names within the first 100 Google Search results, but what I found was:
Former Antique governor Exequiel Javier vowed to contest a court ruling that found him guilty of violating an election law in 2013.
“We will file an appeal this week and bring it to the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court if necessary,” Javier told the INQUIRER on Monday evening
The former governor insisted that he did not violate the Omnibus Election Code because he was abiding by the Local Government Code when he implemented a 30-day preventive suspension against Mayor Mary Joyce Roquero of Valderrama town in Antique.
Javier said the suspension order, which was issued on Jan. 23, 2013, was not covered by the 90-day ban on the suspension of elective officials before the May 13, 2013 elections based on the Local Government Code.
Tourism Secretary Wanda Teo and four members of the House of Representatives are set to leave for Iceland and Norway this week, ostensibly to study the two European countries’ practices on gender equality.
A report published by the Philippine Star on July 11 identified the House politikos joining the trip as Reps. Ma. Carmen Zamora of Compostela Valley, Mark Aeron Sambar of PBA party-list, Paolo Everardo Javier of Antique and Oscar Richard Garin Jr. of Iloilo.
Teo and the lawmakers will also be joined in the trip scheduled from July 14 to 22 by four employees of the House secretariat and at least three officials of the Department of Tourism.
Two journalists have filed a plunder complaint against former Antique Gov. Exequiel Javier and his son, Rep. Paolo Everardo Javier, for alleged rigging of projects and ill-gotten wealth.
Radio commentators Wilson Geronimo and Modesto Montano filed the plunder complaint on Friday before the Office of the Ombudsman, vowing to be critical journalists who chose not to stay silent.
In their complaint, the journalists expressed dismay at the Javiers’ alleged malfeasance in office even as the former governor is the brother of slain opposition leader Evelio Javier.

The Ukrainian crisis: why Filipinos must be pragmatic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/the-ukrainian-crisis-why-filipinos-must-be-pragmatic/,"The military conflict involving Kiev and Moscow has been making the headlines of various news outlets all over the world. This Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict officially started when current Russian president Vladimir Putin recognized two people’s republics located in Eastern Ukraine, which are Luhansk and Donetsk. Collectively, they are grouped together as the Donbas region, where residents in these areas are said to be sympathetic towards the Russians. Kremlin-backed media emphasize that these incursions involve conducting “special military operations”. On the other hand, western-backed media label these operations as an “invasion”, where Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are being tested. Nevertheless, losses in human lives are mounting, economic damage is exponentially increasing, and political uncertainty in Eurasia is looming.
The effects of the Ukrainian crisis are felt beyond these Slavic nation-states. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are providing various military hardware such as precision-guided missiles, and are also extending different kinds of assistance to elements confronting the Russian armed forces. Liberal democracies are slapping numerous economic sanctions against Russia and Russian oligarchs, where countries that are geographically distant from Eastern Europe like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore have joined the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in denouncing and punishing such aggression. Multinational companies have also suspended their services, further isolating Moscow and restricting access to the international markets. All of these has made Russia the most heavily sanctioned country on the planet.
This brewing conflict entails geopolitical factors related to Ukraine and Russia. First would be Russia’s security concerns as NATO membership expands. Right before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, then-General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and then-President George HW Bush had verbally agreed that NATO will end at Germany’s borders. However, NATO has gradually extended its membership to Warsaw Pact countries, successor countries of Yugoslavia, and even to other Soviet Socialist Republics previously aligned with Kremlin. Extending such membership to Kiev would therefore threaten Moscow, as its own political survival would be questioned once American ballistic missiles are menacingly stationed nearby. Second would be about the Crimean peninsula and the port city of Sevastopol, since it is strategically located in the Black Sea, where Russians can extend their influence to the Mediterranean Sea. Crimea was later annexed in 2014 under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens. With this annexation, Kiev has halted water flow to the peninsula, making Crimea experience drier seasons while putting the welfare of its local residents at risk. Lastly, hydrocarbons have been discovered and can be extracted in three separate regions of Ukraine, which are in Ukraine’s west, east, and in the south imbedded under the Black Sea. Initially, these resources were difficult to extract, but with the advent of hydraulic fracturing or fracking, Kiev can access gas and oil, which it can export to the Europeans. Fearing such economic competition that would lower Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, eliminating potential competitors through predatory military tactics would work in favor of Moscow’s interests by maintaining its market share.
With those factors enumerated, global markets have trembled, adversely affecting both wealthy and poor countries. Knowing that modern-day living is backed by these hydrocarbons and with political volatility inviting economic uncertainty, the prices of crude oil and other petroleum-related commodities continue to skyrocket. In addition, both Ukraine and Russia export billions of dollars worth of wheat, a key food resource. These two situations would definitely generate a cost-push inflation in any economy, harming the most marginalized sectors of the society. Other businesses would attempt to adapt by adopting stealth inflation, where the price stays the same but the product’s gross weight is lessened. Conclusively, consumers’ purchasing power is diminished, leading to a possible deterioration of living standards. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable Filipinos will continue experiencing these economic hardships.
On social media, Filipino netizens strongly denounce Russia’s aggressive military actions, even though it is noticeable that a significant majority of them have virtually no background on the subject matter of Russian affairs. Numerous Filipinos would rather take the moral high ground and create labels. One particularly popular one is of the Russian strongman as reincarnation of the vilified Nazi Germany’s Fuhrer. They come up with these without comprehending the underlying dynamics of European politics. This is a reflection of how the Catholic church’s teachings have penetrated the Filipino psyche, creating more gullible victims of false dichotomies instead of a populace capable of critical thinking.
Taking a look at the Philippine’s colonial history under American administration, the liberal school of thought in international relations had also made its way to the Filipino intelligentsia through Wilsonianism. This can be traced to when then-US President Woodrow Wilson convinced American legislators to join hands with imperialist Britain and France in fighting Wilhelmine Germany, which resulted to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and the establishment of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations. However, the idealist nature of the Wilsonian thought fails to explain these events associated with the Ukrainian crisis, most specially that United Nations (UN) resolutions raised in the security council and the general assembly condemning acts of violence are virtually toothless. It must be viewed in accordance with realism because nation-states act rationally in serving their interests.
Realism entails the realpolitik of nations, of what is practical and what is pragmatic. In foreign relations, recognizing these interests is direly needed before taking a stand that may either run congruent or contradict with popular public opinion. This stands true since the language of diplomacy is dialogue and concessions serve as its currency. Looking back at the Philippine setting, what do we think of our country’s realpolitik, specially in foreign policy? Citing the three pillars of Philippine foreign policy, which are national security, economic security, and assistance to nationals, what do we think is there for the Philippines in this Ukrainian crisis, and how can these international issues be turned to opportunities? That is only something that the next chief architect of Philippine foreign policy can decide on.
Former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a renowned Soviet academician, mentioned in his book entitled “Russian Crossroads” how former US President Richard Nixon described himself and his Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger as “sons of bitches” in promoting and defending America’s national interests. Nixon’s choice of words might be crass, but it completely reflects the country’s need to adopt pragmatic and amoral policies in enforcing its national interests. Political scientists might use the word Machiavellian, but statesmen are meant to create a peaceful and prosperous environment for all the residents to enjoy.
With the Philippine general elections ending in a couple of months, Filipino voters cannot afford to be swindled anymore. Instead, the electorate ought to choose candidates who know no fear when labelled as “sons or daughters of bitches” in the name of Philippine interests.",Politics
"Grand Yellowtard rally at Emerald Avenue, Ortigas Center an impressive “show of force”. Will it translate to votes?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/grand-yellowtard-rally-at-emerald-avenue-ortigas-center-an-impressive-show-of-force-will-it-translate-to-votes/,"From what started out as an estimated 80,000-strong crowd before sunset yesterday, the “official” estimate issued this morning (and amplified by mainstream media) ballooned to 137,000. In its “report” on the event, Inquirer “reporters” Jeannette I. Andrade and Krixia Subingsubing further bumped up the estimate to 180,000. As expected, most participants in this rally wore pink — a reminder that theirs is an exclusive club of partisans who identify with a political brand. This latest “show of force” was impressive — impressive in how it demonstrates the resolve of a beleaguered political camp to send across to the public an unfounded perception that they are “winning”. But are the Yellowtards actually winning? This is the more important question. How many voters are the Yellowtards actually converting?
The most recent reports on voter preference polls issued by reputable research firms show that administration tandem Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte continue to maintain a formidable — very likely insurmountable — lead over the rest of the Opposition candidates. Pulse Asia, reporting off the results of a survey conducted over the 18th through the 23rd February showed Marcos and Duterte attracting 60 and 53 percent of survey respondents’ preferences respectively. Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo attracted a measly 15 percent while Opposition vice presidential candidate exhibited a more respectable 24 percent of respondents. The recent Publicus Asia Pahayag report made use of an even more recently-collected sample acquired over the period 9th through the 14th March. This period would have likely captured any change in voter sentiment accounted for by successful Yellowtard rallies conducted then. The fact is, however, there is no evidence that the proverbial needle had moved. The more recent Publicus report remains generally consistent with the Pulse Asia numbers with Marcos and Duterte attracting 55 and 56 percent of survey respondents’ preferences respectively.
All that these rallies really prove is that Yellowtard supporters are willing to dress in their pink best, get on a chartered bus, and scrunch together in a rally at the beck and call of their “leaders” on a Sunday afternoon. As to the number of non-Yellowtards who would suddenly experience a miraculous change of preference and express this by doing the same? There is no reliable way of measuring how many people fit that story. In short, it is only a fool who would conclude on the bases of these “shows of force”, impressive as they may be, that voters are being won from rivals.
More importantly, the manner with which the Yellowtards are trying to win over voters is intellectually-dishonest. All of what they contribute to the national political chatter are no more than appeals to emotion. The colour, crowds, and, notably, the celebrities who perform for free at these rallies are targeting only one thing — an emotional response. Even this far into the campaign, the Yellowtards would be hard-pressed to articulate clearly what their “movement” even stands for. They proclaim themselves Filipinos’ “champions of democracy”, yet show no evidence that said democracy is even being threatened to begin with. They claim on one hand to to be “in solidarity” with gay people and feminists yet, on the other, schmooze with the conservative Roman Catholic Church whose members and honchos are dogmatically opposed to both. These bald inconsistencies are likely at the root of why a strong colour branding is being used in this campaign — to distract Filipinos to the vacuousness and dishonesty of Yellowtard ideology.
With just a little more than 40 days to go in the campaign it looks like rallies like these are all the Yellowtards really have to show the Filipino voter. Anecdotes of members of their lot “converting” their parents, their driver, their maids, and even their own children are being exchanged in Yellowtard echo chambers. But if the polls are to be believed, even if all the rest of the Opposition candidates stand down from their candidacies and back Robredo as a “unified” force, Marcos would still enjoy a comfortable lead. And if they lose these elections? There are indications that they have already thought that far ahead. One cannot put it past them to incite rumblings of another “people power revolution” that they hope would result in an illegal change in leadership. The Yellowtards, quite simply, feel entitled to an electoral win this year as they are of the strong belief that God himself is on their side.

Ukraine will win as surely as Bongbong Marcos will be our next president,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/ukraine-will-win-as-surely-as-bongbong-marcos-will-be-our-next-president/,"Without a shadow of doubt, Ukraine which is in the fight of its life against a massive superpower will ultimately win the war for its right to exist. It’s not a question of firepower, but rather that of wills. Just as how America eventually lost the war to small poor nations like Vietnam and eventually left packing their bags in Afghanistan, Russia does not have as much will-power to fight as the Ukrainians.
Even if we see Russia eventually apparently taking the entire country captive, it will just be a matter of time till they throw their hands in despair with the nagging insurgency and guerrilla tactics of the native Ukrainians – who have the rest of the world on their side. Russian dreams of border expansion and adventurism are just the brainchild of one mad person and will die out as soon that person exits the stage, pretty much like the demise of Nazism with Hitler’s defeat and death. Besides Putin’s entire campaign is borderline lunacy: Why would Russia with with a landmass stretching from Europe to Asia and in possession of all the resources that go with it risk its international standing and economic stability just to gain a negligible piece of land as Ukraine? Well as the old joke goes: Why do dogs lick their balls? Because they can!!!
How this David vs. Goliath spectacle will end is already quite predictable. Too many people across the globe have the collective will to see who should win the game. Japan in the 1940s did have that same vision to impose its Imperial reign across the greater Asian sphere only to find itself getting nuked to submission. Aggressors (deluded or outright evil) ultimately lose in the end.
Putin has already lost the war even among the hearts of his very own people as Russians exit their country in throngs as if jumping off a sinking ship. Russian soldiers likely have very low morale seeing their comrades die in a fight they don’t believe in. Being seen by the entire world as aggressors when everyone seeks peace even through Olympic games, it is very difficult to wear the Russian flag these days.
There are hardly any winners in wars. Both sides end up losing lives, opportunities and fortunes. As much as we can sympathize with suffering Ukrainians, we should also seek to comfort the common Russian, many of whom are stranded in Thai beach resorts without working credit cards and direct flights back to their country.
Nevertheless the world needs a Putin these days. Aren’t news networks fed up with 2 years of counting and graphing Covid cases on a daily basis? Another story needs to unfold, and can there be any thrilling movies without a villain? What is Star Wars without Darth Vader, or the Hunger Games without President Snow? Without epic battles there will be no heroes, and having no heroes means low scores in Rotten Tomatoes.
Even America welcomes wars, as it fuels its budget for advanced technology and military spending, not to mention even more material for blockbuster-making Hollywood. Just like stock market players, we need those downward graphs every once in a while, or else – where else can you apply the rule of buying low and selling high?
Now let’s teleport 8000 kilometers from the heat of Ukrainian urban battle to the brimming political landscape of the Philippines sizzling in the leadup to the May 9 presidential elections. What’s the analogy between Ukraine’s fight for survival and Philippine elections these days? Just as the surveys are all showing, this year’s elections are already so predictable, if not set in stone. It’s just a matter of time till the sure-as-sunrise winner is formally announced. And for those who doubt surveys, inasmuch as we can be sure these reports are not published by the Illuminati or time-travelers, we all know from past elections that that their sample-based “predictions” are pretty accurate.
Let’s face it: the Bongbong-Sara team will not just win, they will win big. It’s like watching a movie a second time around or watching a film-version of a novel you just read. Still we get so giddy and excited on the build-up to the climax, when we knew all along who eventually wins in the end. So if we all know Bongbong Marcos will win anyway, why vote for underdogs at this stage? Why waste your vote on a sure loser, even if you did believe in what he/she stood for? Three things set the stage for a Marcos comeback to Malacanang:
Now the three things that BBM has done right to secure his win:
To highlight that last point, what makes BBM stand out among the rest of the presidential wannabees is the word greatness and his rallying battle cry to make the Philippines great again. Whereas other candidates offer comfort, survival, and freebees, BBM symbolizes the highest aspirations of Filipinos (many of whom have left the country in shame over its sluggish development and lack of technological, military and industrial strength) – that one day we would not be looked down as losers anymore among the league of nations.
While people across the world wave Ukrainian flags in support of a people fighting to stay alive, the vast majority of Filipinos will fly their “Italian flags” in a cry for that hope of unity and greatness. And as Ukrainians launch those precision anti-tank rockets on the invading forces, let’s hope the Bongbong ballistic missile does fire up and fly high and take this entire nation up with him…
March 12: Philippines successfully launched Bong Bong II, its first liquid-propellant rocket. Rocket was successfully retrieved from South China Sea.

Robredo camp to Filipino voters: Follow us because we are the “good guys” and we are SMARTER than you,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/robredo-camp-to-filipino-voters-follow-us-because-we-are-the-good-guys-and-we-are-smarter-than-you/,"This is the vibe one gets when observing the desperate house-to-house campaign the Yellowtard camp of Leni Robredo are now mounting under her daughter Tricia’s orders. The approach is one of condescension — as if they are on a Mission from God to evangelise the heathens. It is no different from the pretence of benevolence the Spanish conquistadores applied to their subjugation of what was to become the Hispanic world today. Perhaps it is no surprise that the elitist demographic that has come to characterise the Yellowtard camp behaves this way — because many of them are either descended from or continuing beneficiaries of the peoples of the Philippines’ former imperial masters. Indeed, many of them are actually products of the remnants of that regime — the Roman Catholic Church, the cartel of chi chi private schools these vassals of foreign overlords run, and the fortified residential enclaves that protect their genealogical purity.
Whereas, Yellowtard partisans now humbly knock at the doors of Filipino voters they seek to “reach”, there was, of course, no polite knocking involved when they exploited the cosy relationships their leaders enjoyed with Big Corporate Media oligarchs who have the power to push content into people’s houses and personal spaces without the need to do any knocking. Indeed, that their minions now resort to knocking on doors serves as testament to how ineffective their trespassing had become. Not only have the Yellowtards’ minions in mainstream media failed to deliver, the massive rallies and campaign stunts that aimed to boost the electoral fortunes of Robredo over the last several weeks had not moved the proverbial needle significantly. Only surveys conducted and reported by reputable polling firms serve as the most reliable measure of the effectiveness of any of the candidates’ campaign. As such, no amount of claims on the back of crowd sizes that this or that municipality or city is “pink” holds water no matter how much Big Corporate Media outlets amplify that “information”.
This week, “leaked” highly-pixelated slides of the much-respected Laylo Report have been making waves on social media. This recent report of theirs covers the 16th through the 22nd of March making it the most recent of the lot. The report continues to show administration candidate Bongbong Marcos enjoying a formidable lead over his closest rival Robredo. With 55 percent survey respondents according Marcos a “hard vote” (i.e. not likely to change) to Robredo’s 15 percent and historical data since January showing no statistically-significant change in these results, it is clear that there really is not much else, barring discovery of a ground breaking campaign technique, the Opposition have to work with to change their fortunes over the remaining days.
More important to note, however, is that even in their desperate hour, not much reform is evident in the fundamental messaging the Yellowtards use to communicate and engage with potential voters. The approach remains elitist in nature and condescending. The fact that this is a campaign and that the singular aim of such “conversations” is to persuade voters to convert is impossible to conceal. It also makes it doubly hard to come across as authentic when you’ve been telling them for months that they are mere victims of “disinformation” and “fake news” and suckers for “lies”. After all, what does one have to talk about with someone who you regard as having made stupid choices short of telling them; “listen to me, I’m smarter than you”, in order to be “consistent”. Worse, having identified yourself with the Roman Catholic Church as if to say “God is on our side” makes it awkward as well to make a pitch to a fellow Church-goer who happens to support your rival. What then? Do you press on and challenge them on their faith asking “how could you presume to be a Christian if you support ‘the dictator’s son’?”
These are hard habits to break for Yellowtards. What is a Yellowtard left with to make a persuasive pitch to a Marcos supporter if their favourite two arguments — (1) we are smart and you are stupid and (2) we are “good” and you are “evil” — are now no-go-zones if one is to comply with Tricia’s directive to be nice? Herein lies the fundamental reason why the Yellowtard campaign over the last two to three months did not delivery results and why, very likely, over the next 40 days it will not. It’s a classic case of too little too late. The core foundation of the Yellowtard campaign persists — one that reeks of entitlement, judgement, and condescension. The stench of elitism just simply can’t be purged from the Yellowtard campaign. Tinkering with the strategy at the fringes may change the initial flavour but not the bitter payload underneath any more than rallies of thousands bathed in pink will not reveal much to Filipinos other than demonstrate that one needs to be “pink” to be one of them. In short, Filipinos can easily see that Yellowtards are really not a very inclusive bunch. They lost two national elections over the last six years, which means Filipinos have had enough time to make their choices — despite being incessantly told they were “stupid” and “evil” over much of that time.",Politics
"Mistakes, miscalculations, and mismanagement summarize the Liberal Party’s leadership",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/mistakes-miscalculations-and-mismanagement-summarize-liberal-partys-leadership/,"The signing of Imperial Japan’s instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri officially created a deadline for the Philippine commonwealth to transition herself to the third republic. The Nacionalista party, a political party established by Presidents Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmena, was dominating the legislature with their numbers. With President Quezon succumbing to tuberculosis during the second world war, then-Vice President Sergio Osmena took office and enjoyed an initial advantage as the incumbent chief executive in the lead up to the 1946 presidential elections. The first general elections of the third Philippine republic pitted two candidates hailing from the Nacionalista party, President Osmena against Senate President Roxas. With President Osmena placing too much trust on his achievements and name recall, his complacency later paved the way for his own defeat. The political rift generated between those factions inside the Nacionalista party gave birth to the Liberal party of the Philippines, which was founded by then-Senators Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino.
This separation between those two parties can be viewed through their differences in accordance to the political spectrum, which separates conservatives from liberals. Such differences are visible in the mature democracies of the United Kingdom’s parliamentary system and that of the United States’ presidential system. The United Kingdom has the Conservative and Labour parties, while the United States has the Republicans and the Democrats. Even countries that had a long history of authoritarian and militaristic governments such as in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan later adopted such political separation. These differences in their political ideologies provide a glimpse as to how they craft government policies as instruments of administration. Unfortunately, this cannot be said to describe that of the Philippines because of the nation’s weak institutions. Coupled with Filipino-style politicking, it can be easily observed why Philippine politics had always been both demeaning and demoralizing.
Philippine political institutions had never matured and, undeniably, continue to be non-inclusive, which is similar to how the Spaniards denied Filipinos socio-economic freedoms during the colonial period. In turn, these flawed political institutions of the country created two notable disorders: the proliferation of unstable political parties and turncoats. Ideally in a government, the administration creates and executes laws while the opposition performs its duty as a balancing, checking body in the legislature. However, this character-based politics of the country has deeply embedded itself in the society, where political parties are no longer bastions of ideologies and constructive dialogues but mere machinations for elections. Paired with local government candidates who willingly neglect their allegiances and principles for political survival, a volatile yet corrosive social environment is created. This was highlighted when the administration of President Benigno Aquino demonstrated how the Liberal party (LP) and its officials governed the Philippine republic.
Borrowing Voltaire’s cynical remark about the Holy Roman Empire, the same can be said about the Liberal party of the Philippines. The LP is neither liberal, nor a party, nor for the Philippines. First is that the aforementioned party is liberal only in name. They proudly espouse human rights and civil liberties, which are essential in liberalism. However, the LP is merely paying lip-service to such advocacies since they are designed only to suit the interests of the party’s stockholders. Together with a sympathetic media, they have creatively pushed for narratives that appear liberal externally, but remain internally illiberal. Such can be observed since there is a near complete absence of liberalizing reforms in their administration, specially in the Philippine economy. They blocked these critical reforms because they utterly dislike enfranchising groups of individuals that would become potential competitors for power. Protectionism, not liberalization, is the name of LP’s game.
Also, the Liberal party is no political party because aside from the clear absence of binding fundamental ideologies between their members, it is only created as a platform of fielding candidates during elections. LP has taken advantage of popular opinion that distracts from and camouflages their hidden, malicious, and nefarious interests. Their connections with traditional media entities sustain a deadly propaganda machine. Through media, LP can manipulate public opinion easily, where they can vilify one innocent individual with a guilty verdict in the eyes of an ordinary man. Such is the harrowing situation of a hollow political party.
Finally, the Liberal party was never for the Filipinos. Their desire to control and monopolize narratives divides the society with their self-righteous and culpable actions. In addition, the lack of reforms in their policies made the wealthy, wealthier and the poor, poorer. Their lackadaisical governance is an embarrassment to the electorate. How can we expect freedom from the dehumanizing effects of poverty if the LP promotes institutions that are both politically and economically extractive? How can the intergenerational poverty of Filipinos be resolved when the said political party does not craft and submit legislation that promotes the creation of employment opportunities? Serving the interests of the country’s political and economic elites definitely come first, and defending national interests is a far second for the LP.
All of these observations regarding the Liberal party of the Philippines are clear when one contextualizes Benigno Aquino’s presidency and his dismal performance. First is about the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which was deliberately used to purchase the services and political support of various lawmakers. This “pork barrel” had substantially increased during his administration and was distributed under the LP’s discretion. Fortunately, the Supreme Court declared the unconstitutionality of PDAF. Speaking of the highest judicial body, the impeachment trial of the chief magistrate added a hideous blemish to Philippine history as allies of then-President Aquino mocked the check-and-balance system of the 1987 constitution. They engaged in trial-by-publicity, which compelled the senators to impeach Chief Justice Renato Corona, except for the three defiant yet dignified legislators. Lastly, the macabre massacre of the country’s special action forces demonstrated the lack of finesse in decision-making of the chief executive and his stalwarts. LP’s incompetence costed precious lives and guess what they have been saying all along; those incidents were never their fault.
The Aquino administration was pampered with strong and timely fiscal policy reforms that President Gloria Arroyo introduced. It was a matter of stabilizing the country. Instead, however, Aquino resorted to hijacking and cannibalizing these faulty institutions. Dysfunctional mass transport systems, filthy airport schemes, botched relief operations, massive bribery, and lowered morale of the armed forces are mere symptoms of the LP’s brand of governance, which should definitively form no part in the nation-building process. However, here they are again, being rebranded from yellows to pinks as they attempt to wage this moral crusade in reclaiming Malacañang. This can be analogized with how Amb. Rigoberto Tiglao as also articulated in his book entitled Debunked mentioned that PDAF was basically renamed as “Bottom-up budgeting projects”, while maintaining its sinister objectives. Hopefully, the 2022 elections would follow the patterns of 2016 and 2019 when the electorate served the LP humiliating defeats that irrevocably lost them the people’s mandate. If they are to survive, the Liberal party of the Philippines must transform internally and recalibrate themselves first, lest they fall further to the abyss of irrelevance.",Politics
"On Tricia Robredo’s orders, Yellowtards get down to house-to-house campaign as DESPERATION sets in",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/on-tricia-robredos-orders-yellowtards-get-down-to-house-to-house-campaign-as-desperation-sets-in/,"A call to action recently issued by Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo’s daughter Tricia Robredo (who is a woman) in a Facebook post has set in motion a desperate effort across the Yellowtard community to hit the road and campaign house-to-house. With just a bit more than 40 days to go, this getting-down-to-the-weeds presumably aims to close the enormous gap between frontrunner and administration candidate Bongbong Marcos’s voter preference ratings and Robredo’s dismal numbers.
Bilang #kakampinkwednesday din naman ngayon, my ask is for us to go out of circles. Lumabas, makinig at subukang makiusap ng mahinahon. Medyo more than six years na ring nakakatempt mangbarda lolz but habaan pa ng kaunti ang pasensya. Be more mindful of comments that do come off as offensive and elitist. Avoid name-calling (ie bobo, bayaran). Maraming nabiktima lang din ng disinformation. Maraming hirap, kumakayod at naghahanap lang ng maiuuwi sa pamilya. Ipaglaban din natin sila.
Sa susunod na 47 days (!), samahan niyo kaming mag-ikot or gawa rin kayo ng lakad with your own groups if you have extra time! Matrabaho at minsan nakakadismaya ang ganitong lakad, pero lahat ng bagay pinaghihirapan. Hataw tayo sa pag-convert sa umaga para mas dumami pa tayong makisaya sa rallies pag gabi 🙂
Translated from Taglish to English: “As part of #kakampinkwednesday, my ask is for us to go out of [our] circles. Get out there, listen, and put in an effort to engage in a sober conversation. It’s been about six years and the temptation to antagonise is there but let’s try to be a bit more patient. Be more mindful of comments that do come off as offensive and elitist. Avoid name-calling (i.e., bobo, bayaran). There are many victims of disinformation. There are many who are struggling to make a living and feed their families. Let’s fight for them too. In the next 47 days, join us as we make the rounds or organise your own with your respective groups if you have extra time! These sorties are labour-intensive and often frustrating but everything worth having requires sacrifice. Let’s go all out to convert in the morning so we gain more participants to join our festive rallies at night.”
Note that Tricia could not even be bothered to compose her call to action in proper language with proper grammar and punctuation. Would you write this way to people you respect? Just looking at this substandard form she applies to issuing her message, it is evident that Tricia Robredo does not think that highly of her mother’s supporters and campaign team members.
However, the bigger irony in Tricia’s attempts to undo decades of elitism and dishonesty in the Yellowtard “cause” lies in the very language she uses in her message. She calls on her followers to be “a bit more patient” — as if they are about to engage in a bunch of retards (which, evidently, is how they see the people they seek to convert). She also sees most of these people they seek to convert as “victims of disinformation” — further confirming that the Yellowtards see the support base of their rival as no more than suckers who had been lied to or have made their decisions on who to support on the basis of lies. To be fair, she does inadvertently admit that what really motivates her and this call to action she now issues comes down to one thing: to convert voters. In short, after years of belittling people who begged to differ to their points of view, Robredo now makes a call to be nice to them in order to win their votes. A class act indeed.
How effective could this desperate house-to-house campaign be with just 40 days to go? Some simple maths may shed a bit of light on the matter. According to Facebook, Tricia’s post had attracted about 40,000 positive reactions after being shared almost 10,000 times. If, say, every one of these Facebook users heeded the call and worked 16 hours a day (as Leni Robredo says she does) visiting about 2 houses per hour, the effort would collectively cover about 1.3 million houses per day. If they sustain that for 40 days, they would, in theory, have covered more than 50 million houses. That’d account for more than the total number of registered voters! So it is, indeed, mathematically feasible. It will come down to how many of these households would be open to re-considering their voting preferences or partisan loyalties. It would also depend on how skilful the members of such a committed force of Yellowtards would be at articulating their pitch.
According to noted Yellowtard “thought leader” Manuel L Quezon III, the cohort of registered voters who support Marcos that are potential converts are what he terms the “soft voters”. Back when he wrote his analysis of the already-dire situation the Yellowtards faced, he pointed out even “with several months left, his core voters could still be whittled down to deny him the 39 percent he needs to be president”. Quezon worked out in his “analysis” that about 27 percent — or an estimated 9 million — of Marcos’s voter base fit the “soft voter” criteria. Of course, this analysis was done back in January when the Yellowtard campaign had lots of time to back their strategy with a bit of hard science. With 40 days to go, the challenge will be in identifying those “soft voters” to target in a go-for-broke approach that, as Robredo herself puts it, will likely be a frustrating and labour-intensive “sacrifice”.
Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, things don’t look too promising. Of the 40,000 who “liked” or “hearted” Tricia’s Facebook blurb, one would be hard-pressed to find a good enough number who would be willing to get out of their airconditioned family homes, go out to the Payatas and preach Yellowtardism to the masses under the sweltering summer heat. More importantly, it is worth noting that if even a Robredo daughter could not avoid using elitist language in an appeal to not be elitist, what hope is there that the boots on the ground she manages to mobilise from that 40,000 will consist of enough folks who possess enough self-awareness to engage in an authentic conversation with the masa? Good luck is all one can say for now to the embattled Yellowtard campaign. Part of what would have made these elections exciting and intellectually stimulating is if a credible Opposition were in it to give the popular incumbent camp a run for their money. In this case, all Filipinos get is a pathetic trial-and-error Opposition.",Politics
Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Ball and Chain in the Old Oak Tree,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/tie-a-yellow-ribbon-on-the-ball-and-chain-in-the-old-oak-tree/,"I’m comin’ home, I’ve done my time
Now I’ve got to know what is and isn’t mine…”
The people has spoken and punctuated it with rage that drove the final nails to the coffin of the Yellowtards’ political dreams. A seething anger to be exact.
It has been the goal of the Yellows-turned-Pink for six years to use anger that supposedly will come from the electorate, to use it against Duterte and all the remnants of the strongman Marcos Senior’s regime.
But unfortunately for them, that rage they were trying to incite in the people against the government backfired. They’ve realized (albeit a bit too late) that they’ve already alienated the very ones who they want to be on their side. And they’ve waken up into the nightmare that they were already dealing with:
Engaging the toxic Yellow army head on was futile, so the ordinary voters figured. For who can withstand the constant vitriol and all the personal attacks?
And so the people just waited for the perfect moment for redemption: May 9th 2022.
They know fully well that it’s the perfect opportunity to say the F-word and “screw you” in a civilized and democratic way.
And that, they did with finality and emphasis – 16M times for the presidency and 21M times for the vice presidency.
Finally, the “bobo” and the “tanga” electorate as the Yellowtards relished to name the people outside of their echo chambers, finally had a new meaning to the old song symbolizing LP’s return to power:
Now the whole damned bus is cheerin’
And I can’t believe I see –
– the Yellowtards and Pinklawans met with a hundred yellow ribbons round the ball and chain that’ll be tied to their feet in the ole oak tree,
never to rape the lands again and be free.”",Politics
Literal Martial Law Crybaby: Lorenzo Legarda Leviste’s shrill tantrum vs. mom Loren published by Rappler,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/literal-martial-law-crybaby-lorenzo-legarda-levistes-shrill-tantrum-vs-mom-loren-published-by-rappler/,"Opposition “social news network” Rappler has pulled Philippine “journalism” down to a new low after it featured an “open letter” penned by Lorenzo Legarda Leviste, son of Senator Loren Legarda. Legarda is currently running for re-election under the banner of administration presidential bet Bongbong Marcos.
Reading his “open letter”, one could almost picture the Leviste boy rolling all over the floor pounding his fists in a monumental fit of expression of his self entitlement. Leviste writes how “for weeks” he has “been paralyzed in [sic] pain”…
For weeks I have been crying every day, screaming every day until I spat out blood. The decision she’s made is so profoundly unthinkable, unconscionable, unforgivable. In the last month, my entire life has collapsed. It is beyond a nightmare. I still cannot believe it and will never be able to accept it.
The poor Leviste boy’s “entire life has collapsed”. How horrid. Did someone call an ambulance? For a Yellowtard who likely caught wind of his mother’s political activities from the emotional blackmail served to Filipinos for breakfast everyday by Big Corporate Media outlets like Rappler and ABS-CBN News, the Leviste boy seems to still not get what poor people go through. A “collapsed life” is certainly not one led by some whiny kid who grew up in a comfy mansion in a chi chi private subdivision. Master Leviste only need consult his publisher — preeminent purveyor of Filipino poverty porn — to gain a bit of that latter insight.
The 30-something Leviste boy then proceeds to banish himself from House Legarda-Leviste screeching “I need everyone to know that Loren Legarda lost her son forever because of this.” Well, dude, everyone certainly knows now. Mission accomplished. Now what?
It is hardly surprising that Lorenzo became the man (to use the term loosely) that he is today. According to a 2004 Arab News report, Legarda was involved in a tiff with the Ateneo dr Manila Grade School after it refused a request from her to “adjust the grade of their son in one subject from 84 to 85 so that he could graduate with honors from Grade Seven.” The report quoted a parent who went on record to state that they “were saddened by the values that Loren and her [then] husband [ex-Batangas Governor Antonio Leviste] are teaching the boy.”
Chalk another one up for the high society world of Yellowtard politics. It seems that turning kids against their parents and cheering their quaint alborotos has become a proud tradition of this degenerate political camp. The Yellowtards, after all, are only too quick to latch on to anything that could make anyone associated with Marcos look bad specially in these desperate remaining days of these elections’ campaign period. The irony that flies way above the pointed heads of the Yellowtard lot is that it is ultimately their brand and their partisans that are made to look like idiots by their dishonest practices.
I am in utter grief. F*** my mother for abetting this. Their crimes are her crimes now. Make her defend them.

We Are Letting A Golden Opportunity Slip Away,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/we-are-letting-a-golden-opportunity-slip-away/,"The Philippines deserves a champion as a president so it deserves Manny Pacquiao . Based on surveys, not only will Manny likely not win the presidency but he may not be long for the race. Philippines ! What is wrong with you? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to elect a real winner.
It takes cerebral prowess to look out for the Philippines in this big, bad world and I believe Manny Pacquiao has enough cerebral prowess. There was a nasty rumor going around that Manny got his degree from Makati university in only 3 months. University of Makati Vice President for Academic Affairs Elyxzur Ramos clarified that Senator Manny got his degree in 16 months. I feel a lot better now. Most honor students need 3 1/2 years to 4 years to get a 4 year degree and Senator Manny got his in less than a year and a half. Judging by how articulate he is when talking about anything and his knowledge on many diverse issues, why should I doubt the veracity of his degree? Though a certain columnist is far more skeptical than I am.
So what is world class intelligence without world class diligence?? Manny Pacquiao in his years of public service has proven that he can maintain an exemplary attendance record in both Congress and the Senate. On May 28 2016 he went on record saying a 100% attendance record in the Senate was feasible.  . This article dated June of 2019 shows how close he was to that 100% from July 2018 to June 2019.
We here at GRP believe at various times have declared that Manny’s brain to be even deadlier than his fists. As early as June of 2012 and July 2016. A book written by boxing journalist Tris Dixon directly contradicts GRP findings  but what the hell does he know?? Manny himself countered with “God will take care of me.” Here at GRP we will argue with pastoral letters about the drug war but never about the Almighty’s mandate to take care of our presidential treasure Manny Pacquiao.
Senator Manny’s round house punch has victimized a few foes in the ring but if elected he will erect houses of a different kind.
“I want each Filipino to have their own house,” Manny said in a statement in Filipino. “That’s why I asked for your signatures, so you could be given a free house.”
Who are we to doubt this man? God is taking care of him, he finished university in 16 months, he is extremely attentive to his legislative duties, he starred in Wapakman , he coached Kia Motors  and he keeps his word time and time again. Those houses are as good as built and lived in.
Finally , a winner like Manny Pacquiao knows a winner when he sees one. He went on record as saying If all Filipinos were like Vice President Leni Robredo, he would not be running for president. Manny is running I assume to perfect the Filipino race with Leni Robredo as the role model. Get Real Philippines has a similar deep admiration for Ms. Robredo since our nickname for he is MaSmart. Something to do with Smartmatic and May 9 2016 if I recall.

Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte tandem CRUSH Opposition in Election Day unofficial tally!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/bongbong-marcos-and-sara-duterte-tandem-crush-opposition-in-election-day-unofficial-tally/,"The swiftness with which it became evident that administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte running for president and vice president respectively are runaway winners was astounding. Just a couple of hours after voting precincts officially closed, even mainstream media outlets were already reporting the tandem were ahead of their closest rival by several millions with just 46 percent of votes tallied.
By about 9pm Manila time, Marcos had hit almost 19 million in the unofficial count effectively breaching the number of votes his soon to be predecessor then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte attracted in 2016. By all accounts, the Marcos Duterte tandem are set to be the first majority voted president and vice president team since the 1987 Yellowtard Constitution was enacted.
As expected, Yellowtard partisans are in the midst of a monumental temper tantrum. Jesuit priest and top Ateneo dr Manila official JBoy Gonzales all but insulted Filipino voters by suggesting in a tweet that the way they had voted in these elections was on the bases of a low bar they set for themselves.
Such was the Yellowtard tililing rampage on social media over the outcome of the election that they lashed out at the Filipino Voter all but revealing their true regard for the people they had, just weeks ago, treated like their best friends. So vicious was this lashing out that the terms “Gago ba kayo” (“Are you stupid?”) and “Mga Bobo” (“All you stupid people”) emerged as top trending topics as news of the unofficial tallies trickled in around 10pm Manila.
As of this writing Marcos already enjoys a majority vote with up to 50 percent of votes from the Visayas and Mindanao still to be tallied. The Marcos-Duterte tandem enjoy a lead that is far beyond the reach of any electoral fraud that may be perpetrated by the Yellowtards at the eleventh hour.

Based on partial results of the unofficial tally reported across media outlets, Marcos and Duterte respectively form the first majority-elected president and vice president tandem in recent history. As such they enjoy an unprecedently strong mandate accorded by the Filipino people. Then again, whether it is a majority vote or the plurality that preceding administrations enjoyed, the real point here is that an elected official serves all Filipinos regardless of who voted for him or her during an election. Corollary to that, Filipinos are enjoined to recognise all elected officials and legislators — even those they did not vote for.
That is how democracy works. People entrust the selection of their leaders and legislative representatives to a system that determines who was chosen by the most voters. The Yellowtards, unfortunately, do not see it that way. They are big fans of democracy when they win but are its biggest detractors when they lose. Worse, they go as far as inciting sedition — even rebellion — to oppose and even depose the legitimate winners of an election. This is evidence of the blatant hypocrisy the Yellowtards apply to their participation in Philippine democracy. Why even field a candidate in an election if their real goal is to acquire power at any cost?
Indeed, the cost to the Filipino people of the Yellowtards’ dishonest regard for Philippine democracy is astounding. The Yellowtards plan to take a destructive role over the next six years rather than one that is constructive and mindful of the interests of the Filipino people. Many Yellowtard partisans have expressed a resolve to campaign for the 2028 elections this early — evidence that this is really all that democracy is all about for them. They fail to realise that democracy and nation building is not just about elections. In fact, the more important aspect of democracy is what happens in between elections. Therefore, how the Opposition conduct themselves over the next six years of a Marcos presidency will be a measure of their true character. Will they act like a child deprived of her candy and remain belligerent throughout? Or will they act like real grownups participating in a mature democracy? This remains to be seen but based on how certain Yellowtards have been behaving lately, there is little promise in seeing that happen for now.
Why do the Yellowtards behave like this? For clues on the origins of this baffling attitude, we need to look back at how their late matriarch Cory Aquino came to power in 1986. Cory came to power on the back of what was essentially no more than a garden variety US-backed a coup d état. Once seated, she presided over a “revolutionary government” which is really just a nice term for an illegitimate government that operates outside of the frame of the existing law at the time. Most astounding of all, Aquino was sworn in before then Supreme Court Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee. Despite Aquino having effectively broken the law at the time by installing herself as an illegitimate president, no less than the Supreme Court Chief Justice (whose job it is is to ensure things are done in compliance with the effective national Constitution at the time) was conscripted into service to legitimise her “presidency”. One can see just how nonsensical this whole affair was. If one is truly a “revolutionary” leader, then no existing law will apply to the government he or she presides over until such time that the new order is established and a new legal frame supersedes the earlier. An illegitimate power grab can never be “legitimised” within the frame of a Constitution it offended. Aquino even back then was already insulting the intelligence of the Filipino people.
From that brief history lesson, the core DNA of the character of the Yellowtard “movement” becomes really clear. The Yellowtards, at their core, are tolerant of illegitimacy. They live and breath it. This is why, for them, democracy is a mere tool of distraction that they use to continue to perpetrate their nefarious political agendas under the radar of public scrutiny. Unfortunately for them, this modus operandi only worked in an era where Big Corporate Media organisations held a monopoly over mass communication. That era ended in the twilight years of Cory Aquino’s life. The effects of social media on national politics were only beginning to be felt when her son, Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III began his ascent to power. Fortunately for the Aquinos, they managed to sneak in a Second Aquino Presidency before Filipinos acquired the tools to keep Big Corporate Media honest and break their power to control the country’s political narrative.
The irony that flies over the heads of the Yellowtards is that it is this very tech-enabled ability of every Filipino to keep powerful institutions like their media industry, their Churches, and their politicians honest today that will also prevent the much-hyped “return to authoritarianism” that that is standard fodder for their shrill “activism” surrounding Marcos’s rise to power. Even today, the mere mention of “a descent to authoritarianism” is enough to induce an eruption of screeching sky-is-falling “activism” across the social media landscape. What more if a sitting leader actually attempts to take steps towards that goal. For that matter, for all the fear mongering the Yellowtards propagate around the idea that a Second Marcos Presidency will necessarily “plunge” the Philippines into a new “Dark Age”, it is likely that even their foremost “thought leaders” will be hard-pressed to describe exactly how Marcos would go about doing that.
Given the improbability of just about every scenario the Yellowtards get their panties all twisted about, one then wonders what it is exactly the Yellowtards want? Do they really want to see a prosperous, strong, and happy Philippines? Nowhere in their rhetoric is there any evidence that they actually aspire to that goal. It seems all the Yellowtards really want is power. Even now, in the face of insurmountable evidence that Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte had won these elections, Yellowtard leader Leni Robredo is the only remaining Opposition presidential candidate who has not conceded. That, by itself, attests to her dishonest character. It also serves as an ominous portent to the sort of Opposition Filipinos will have to put up with over the next six years.",Politics
Nobody likes being associated with losers,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/nobody-likes-being-associated-with-losers/,"Sure, losing presidential candidate Leni Robredo, we are told, will be turning her “KakamPink” flock into a “movement” of some sort. Not surprising that she’d take this position of defiance despite the landslide victory of her rival administration candidate Bongbong Marcos. Robredo is, after all, surrounded by idiots. Indeed, many political analysts doing a post mortem on Robredo’s Yellowtard campaign today attribute the failure of her bid to a disorganised and narcissistic team of “creatives”. Rather than listen to what the people were saying and to what the data was clearly showing, these bozos kept themselves busy over the last six months singing to their own choir.
As if to further reinforce the narcissism that ran their campaign to the ground, the Yellowtards, yet again, massed in great numbers for a “thanksgiving” powow on the Loyola Heights campus grounds of chi chi Ateneo de Manila University. Again their “thought leaders” crowed about the huge numbers they attracted to this event evidently not learning an important lesson from weeks of organising similar rallies that these crowds count for jack shit in the national scheme of things.
This inability to reflect and learn lessons seems to be an acute mental disorder afflicting the Yellowtards. They continue to believe they are the centre of the universe and that their perspective trumps all the rest. Interestingly, business leaders attest to the value of failure. They see failure as an opportunity to learn. Indeed, the most successful people often have war stories of failure to tell anyone who cares to listen. This wisdom, however, does not seem to hold true for the Yellowtards. Rather than learn from failure, they huddle together with their like-minded pals and lean on one another’s grief as an opiate to dull their ability to perceive hard realities they need to confront.
Losers surrounded by losers think they are able to galvanise themselves into a “movement” that will “keep the fire burning”. This works for a while when wounds are open and raw and the opium of shared solidarity in loss remains potent. The reality, however, is far more stark. Over the longer term, people don’t like being associated with losers. The fact is, Leni Robredo is a big loser in these elections. The margin Marcos won over Robredo is greater than the number of votes she attracted. The loss can be described in the Philippines’ vernacular using one word: tambak.
In the bigger scheme of things, political analysts worth their salt are discussing and debating what shape the Philippine Opposition will take over the next six years. It is likely that Leni Robredo will not figure in this new political order. While, for now, Robredo is the go-to as far as the remains of the day the beaten Opposition in these election sift through in their pained efforts to come to terms with their loss, it is likely that she will eventually be left to scrounge for relevance as the light of her “movement” dims and her once formidable following dwindles. Such is the fate of the biggest loser in these erstwhile “important” elections.",Politics
What to do now with all those People Power memorial relics and other Yellowtard statues and monuments,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/what-to-do-with-all-those-people-power-memorial-relics-and-other-yellowtard-statues-and-monuments/,"What does one do with all those statues of Ninoy Aquino and Cory Aquino littering the Philippines? What is the plan for all these buildings and spaces appropriated to the commemoration of Yellowtard “heroes” and their “glorious” stories? These are now all but quaint legacies of an era that ended this year — one that saw a single compound feudal clan — the Aquinos and Cojuangcos — utterly dominating the national political narrative and culture with their dishonest mythology. This hijacking of the national narrative was aided and abetted by their allies in the executive suites of Big Corporate Media and the administrations of a cartel of exclusive private Catholic schools. Now that Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is President of the Philippines, it would certainly come across as strange that relics that symbolise the downfall and subsequent decades-long demonisation of his family and his own very person would continue to stand.
Thus the dilemma now comes to the fore. President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his running mate Vice President-elect Sara Duterte command an unprecedented majority mandate — more than 60 percent of the Filipino Vote — and a Philippine Congress dominated by allies and politicians friendly to his camp. With this clear mandate comes the confronting reality that the outcome of these elections also serves as a referendum against the Yellowtard narrative. Filipinos have spoken and their message to the Yellowtards is that their ideology had all been discredited. The awkward thing about all this is the big monuments and other memorials — many of them actually explicitly manifesting the very symbols of what Filipinos voted against in these elections — that dot the Philippine archipelago. They are now an affront not just to the president-elect himself but to the 31 million Filipinos who voted for him and against the Yellowtards.
What is President Bongbong Marcos to do with these Yellowtard relics? The most practical course of action would be no action. Just let them be. Be the bigger person and just allow the Yellowtards to have their historical artefacts. Perhaps the temptation will be strong among his more militant supporters to vandalise these eyesores. Again, it is best that the camp be the bigger people and desist. These relics, after all, stand as constant reminders of what the Yellowtards had squandered. They had lost an entire nation after decades of dominating political myth making. This they did by failing to prove that a “restoration of democracy” and the “freeing” of Filipinos from “authoritarianism” would set them down the path to prosperity and modernity. Rather, the Yellowtards have, instead, mounted an effort to keep Filipinos beholden to a dishonest ideology that focused on victimhood rather than potential and on fixation on the past instead of a more productive open-minded embrace of a future of what could be.
Yellowtard rhetoric had long ago exceeded its use-by date. Over the period that Filipinos lapped up the idea that their efforts to become a modern and prosperous people involved a “fight” with “evil” forces out to thwart this, Yellowtard ideology was there to provide the underlying dogma for this sort of thinking. Reality eventually caught up with them. There was no “fight” because there was no “evil” at work. There was only the challenge of navigating the world order to carve out a niche for Filipinos to make their mark on the world stage. The habitual use of this long-obsolete laban (“fight”) narrative by the Yellowtards was evident in the very campaign their “leader” Leni Robredo mounted in these very elections and even now, in the aftermath of her crushing defeat, what they continue to latch on to — the possibility that this “fight” will persist as a “movement” over the next six years of the Marcos presidency. Even now, the Yellowtards continue to put up bogeymen for their flock to focus their mojos on — “disinformation”, “trolls”, and “historical revisionism”. These are society’s “evils” in the minds of the Yellowtards that both (1) account for their catastrophic electoral failure this year and (2) will continue to be the objects of the battles their “heroes” are expected to “fight”. Old habits die hard, indeed.
It’s time Filipinos move on from a way of thinking where failure is always necessarily someone else’s fault or the result of a “sinister” or “evil” force working against the “good guys” and their “good intentions”. This inability of the Yellowtards to take personal accountability to step up to compete in a democracy — the popularity contest that they had signed up to — and to accept defeat with grace knowing that the winners played the better game is a cultural cancer that had long afflicted Filipinos. In essence, Yellowtardism represents everything that is wrong with Philippine society and it is high time that Philippine society rid itself of this blight. By all accounts this is exactly what Filipinos voted to do in these elections. To prosper in the modern world where opportunities abound in unprecedented quantities requires a real fight, not against imaginary demons put up by dishonest partisans and “activists” but against personal and real challenges and against other people, parties, and communities we share the playing field with. The 2022 elections marks the end of the crybaby culture the Yellowtards have imprisoned Filipino minds with for far too long. With regard to those relics that stand as poignant reminders of this three-decade-long gaslighting campaign, Filipinos should look to them and think, never again.",Politics
Character-based politics and why it should stop,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/character-based-politics-and-why-it-should-stop/,"The Philippines concluded its recently held general elections, where we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in Philippine history. The Marcos-Duterte tandem, together with a number of their publicly endorsed senatorial candidates, are expected to serve their national positions this coming June. The Marcos-Duterte ticket won by a landslide, garnering around 60% of the total votes, where the incoming Marcos administration is expected to have tremendous political mandate with such a majority. The next government is bound to materialize their platforms, and it begins with choosing and appointing competent private citizens or politicians to various positions. But beyond the results of the sacred ballot boxes, the recent elections exposed how polarizing Philippine politics can be, which can be traced on how hapless the current 1987 constitution really is.
After Corazon Aquino was pushed to the presidency in 1986, a process to change the 1973 Philippine constitution gained traction. In turn, this gave birth to the 1987 constitution, which is basically a continuation of the presidential system introduced by the Americans during the Philippine Commonwealth years. This system of government perpetuated various political and social malaise due to these constitutional limitations that restricted the state and the society in participatory nation-building. Even though the Philippines has a longer history of democracy in comparison to other countries in the Indo-Pacific region, the country didn’t seem to bother to create these inclusive institutions. As a result, various socio-political symptoms persisted and worsened due to character-based politics promoted by this presidential system of government.
The first socio-political symptom is the tremendous influence wielded by the landed gentry and the elites. Tracing back the faulty land tenure programs instituted way back from the Spanish colonial era’s “encomiendas“, these landed elites became similar to European feudal lords during the middle ages. Their primary interest lies on how to expand or maintain their political clout and were never interested in emancipating their tenants from perennial servitude. Their loyalty was never to the country where they belong to but on what is more economically beneficial to them. Due to the Philippines’ inefficient and often altogether ineffective bureaucracy, there are virtually no incentives to enfranchise the lower strata of the society.
The second symptom deals with the toxic relationship of showbiz and politics where, with the nature of Philippine elections, popularity is the name of the game. The mass media and entertainment businesses are willing victims and perpetrators of such games, specially when we see politicians use publicity to cement name recall when elections come. These aforementioned politicians build on working relationships with popular showbiz personalities, hoping that an endorsement would provide the necessary votes to deliver them to public office. This can be noticed further as how these political campaigns are performed, which is uncannily similar to Philippine noon-time variety shows. As a result, candidates resort to singing and dancing, no matter how hilarious they end up looking.
Finally, the last symptom that is being perpetuated by the 1987 constitution is with regard to political dynasties. Numerous political analysts and scientists are quick to identify the detrimental effects of political dynasties, where these political families engage in strategically occupying various posts in both national and local governments. The most common strategy is for a popular family member to occupy any government seat and leave notable legacies in a locality. However, with term limits specified by the constitution, that politician would eye a different electoral position instead, while letting his/her wife, husband, or children inherit that position, which he/she has initially occupied. As such, these term restrictions, which were installed with good intentions, end up creating a system more susceptible to corruption.
These three above-mentioned socio-political dilemmas are mere symptoms that manifest the deeper structural and institutional flaws of the current constitution of the Philippines. The 1987 constitution perpetuates an electoral system where the electorate becomes enamored and fanaticized more on the politicians themselves, rather than their advocacies, principles, and platforms. The Philippine-style “padrino” system has blended uniquely with this character-centric politics where affiliations and allegiances clearly define gainers and losers. As a result, this has relegated meritocracy to the backseat and has visibly lowered state capacity. In addition, this enfranchises public servants to switch alliances, creating turncoats before they become victims of a sinking ship. How can we create a strong republic if such systems disincentive technocracy and instead, favor political patronage?
The Philippine state and the Filipino society should only look at accomplishing one primary objective and that is about creating, perfecting, and preserving inclusive economic and political institutions. These inclusive institutions identify flourishing nation-states and formidable countries that can respond when critical junctures happen. This can be seen with how British history unfolded and how the British state and society pedaled its way towards prosperity.
Prior to the industrial revolution that afforded London the terminology “Pax Britannica” during the 19th century, two significant historical junctures compelled the United Kingdom to create these institutions. The first is when parliament clashed with the English king because of religion and taxation, where the Parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell emerged victorious in this civil war. English society was adamant in its position against the desires of the English king to raise taxes, creating a political gridlock between the monarchy and the parliament which ended in a regicide when King Charles I was executed, leading to the interregnum. In the end, the monarchy returned and later exacted vengeance against the acts of regicide, where Oliver Cromwell himself was executed posthumously. Needless to say, the English society through the parliament acted as a balancer to the excesses of the English monarchical leviathan.
The second juncture is when the Dutch leader William III landed on England and governed the kingdom with his wife, Mary II, deposing King James II. With the dreaded memories from the civil war, the Glorious Revolution was a relatively peaceful transition of power, which afforded British sovereignty not to the crown, but to the parliament. But the most noteworthy is the passage of the Bill of Rights, which put to writing various freedoms and rights of individuals, establishing an environment suitable for participatory and plurality politics. Both the English civil war and the Glorious Revolution created not only inclusive institutions, but also a mutually strong state and society.
Political reformation in Britain happened due to these inclusive institutions, which strengthened individuals to actively participate in politics. However, the lousy 1987 constitution fails to level the playing field between the wealthy and the destitute, and between the strong and the frail. Transforming a constitution that will emphasize coalition-building and consensus-building is a better, cost-effective approach to transitioning when these institutions are adopted. Constitutional reform isn’t a panacea that cures these malaises, but changing the rules as to how politics and economics should be played will undoubtedly make the country more prepared in answering these future challenges that lie ahead.",Politics
DESPERATE Yellowtard campaign gets a morale boost from the latest Pulse Asia March 17-22 survey report,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/desperate-yellowtard-campaign-gets-a-morale-boost-from-the-latest-pulse-asia-march-17-22-survey-report/,"First they tell us that the survey reports of reputable polling firms like Pulse Asia, Social Weather Stations (SWS), Laylo, and Publicus Asia are “unreliable” and even “misleading”. But then when the latest such report published by Pulse Asia (for the period covering the 17th through the 22nd of March) showed Yellowtard candidate Leni Robredo’s preference rating going up nine percentage points and administration candidate Bongbong Marcos’s score going down by four, suddenly these surveys are all god-sends. The results are now evidently something the Yellowtards could pat themselves on the back about seeing that Robredo spokesperson Barry Gutierrez now crows on Twitter, “The survey numbers are starting to reflect what we have been seeing on the ground all along: the massive crowds, the fierce passion, the untiring commitment of Filipinos from all walks of life, coming together to rally behind Leni Robredo’s bid for the Presidency.”
How much more can the Yellowtard campaign do to further chip away at the 32 percentage point lead Marcos still enjoys over Robredo? With just 30 days to go, the only option for Robredo’s yellow-turned-pink mob is to campaign harder. The alternative — finding an innovative way to deliver clear conversions — seems to be outside of the reach of the stunted intellectual faculties of the Yellowtards. For them, campaigning harder, comes in the form of a belated house-to-house effort. However, as desperation sets in, infighting erupts. A noted Yellowtard marketing “expert” points out on Twitter, “yes, H2H can be effective, but given the very short period of time left, can H2H reach all 65M voters in all the islands? that won’t happen. hence advertising is what will reach them.” And what sort of advertising does she propose? Well according to this same “expert”, “attack ads are the most effective in taking down survey leaders like [Marcos]. with so little time left, this is best to do.”
But then, according to an even more influential Yellowtard honcho, venerable Robredo daughter (who is a woman, by the way) Tricia Robredo, the campaign over this ever shortening homestretch should do better than that. “It’s been about six years and the temptation to antagonise is there but let’s try to be a bit more patient. Be more mindful of comments that do come off as offensive and elitist. Avoid name-calling (i.e., bobo, bayaran),” Tricia encourages her followers to apply to their efforts.
What’s a Yellowtard to do? They are subject to conflicting guidance from their revered “thought leaders”. One such particularly-rabid “thought leader” is disgraced former Commission on Elections (COMELEC) commissioner Rowena Guanzon. Guanzon has a storied history of demeaning people who disagree with her. Just last year, she had challenged people to debate her but made it clear that she would only entertain people who “graduated from UP Law or Ateneo Law” — supposedly two of the Philippines’ most prestigious law schools. Recall too that Guanzon also blocked no less than the Dean of Mindanao State University Law School Alizedney Ditucalan himself after he responded to Guanzon’s challenge by citing the case ATTY. MANE vs. JUDGE BELEN (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2119), from where he points out how “the Supreme Court reprimanded a judge for bragging her UP law diploma”.
https://twitter.com/AlizedneyD/status/1254295399059218433
The clock is ticking and the Yellowtards would latch on every morsel that could nourish their rapidly flagging morale — even to the extent of suddenly embracing surveys from reputable polling firms that they had, just weeks ago, rabidly discredited for daring to apply some science to show that they were clearly losing this race. What could they do differently? Whatever they decide and whatever unlikely brainwave they might come up with to campaign smarter and not just harder, it would likely be no more than a case of too little too late. The Yellowtards had years to observe and learn from what had effectively been going on right under their noses. Sadly for them, they did such only in the last two to three months essentially wasting both time and effort.",Politics

Aika Robredo “sex video”: The latest Yellowtard stunt to make them look like victims all for political gain,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/aika-robredo-sex-video-the-latest-yellowtard-stunt-to-make-them-look-like-victims-all-for-political-gain/,"The week has barely started and the Yellowtards have cooked up a new outrage fad. The venerable Philippine Star “reports” on this dubious subject today in its article “Robredo camp slams sex tape allegations involving daughter, urges supporters to ‘hold the line’”. Note, however, the use of the term “allegations”. What then is the Robredo camp “slamming” then? What are they calling on people to “hold the line” against? Looking into the article itself, we find out that these are not even allegations per se but mere “rumors of an alleged sex video involving one of the daughters of Vice President and presidential candidate Leni Robredo”.
PhilSTAR, it seems, is not reporting news. It is “reporting” the cries of bloody “victimhood” that Robredo, her daughters, and the entire Yellowtard Camp are now filling social media with. Evidence of this familiar modus operandi is all there in the PhilSTAR article which “reports” the whole point of this latest circus being all about pinning the blame on “[accounts] supporting the campaign of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the late ousted dictator who is also running for president.” What evidence do they cite that supports this rather hasty conclusion? Nowhere in the article is the answer to this simple question revealed. The lack of any verified evidence that all this noise constitutes a legitimate issue that deserves to be taken seriously evidently did not stop a who’s who of Yellowtard honchos from issuing their two-cent ululations on the matter. PhilSTAR “reporter” Franco Luna does his part and uncritically amplifies it in his “report” as he does quoting a recent tweet from Yellowtard senatorial candidate Chel Diokno…
Ito ang latest script ng kabila, targeting the daughters of VP Leni. Alam nating desperado na sila dahil sa paglakas ni VP, but it takes a special kind of evil to resort to misogynistic attacks against the kids. Ito ba ang uri ng pulitika na gusto natin para sa ating mga anak?
Interestingly enough, the tweet seems to have since been deleted. It is, however, easy to see in the way Diokno worded his tweet that the aim was to use this latest circus as a platform to demonise administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who are leading the race by an effectively insurmountable margin. By now, however, this latest Yellowtard lie seems to be spreading. One culprit is a certain Dr. Gia Sison who uncritically (true to Yellowtard form) takes a “stand” to “defend” the Robredos in a tweet despite not enjoying the benefit of any verification that these sinister conspiracies to disrespect the Robredo family are actually true. What does spreading a lie make one? Well, logically that would make one a liar too.
The fact is, there is no evidence that these “sex tapes” actually exist. Even if they do, they are unlikely to be authentic as it does not take much nowadays to create and spread deep fake videos as the software used to superimpose video footage over another is so readily-downloadable from the Net.
Nonetheless, it is not just PhilSTAR that is amplifying this latest Yellowtard-created circus. The Philippines’ biggest media organisations have themselves jumped on the bandwagon. In “Robredo camp mulls legal action over malicious video”, CNN Philippines quotes Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas who screeches “This is a cheap, sexist online attack meant to demean women and to distract the public from VP Robredo’s crusade for good governance, health-based pandemic response, and people’s welfare”. The Inquirer puts in its own two-cent piece on the matter in “Leni Robredo on hateful attack vs daughter Aika: Stay focused, fight it with truth” which it closes by pointing out that “fact-checker Tsek.ph said that Robredo is the biggest victim of negative misinformation, while her opponent in the 2016 vice presidential polls and in the upcoming 2022 national elections, Bongbong Marcos, is the beneficiary of positive but misleading messages on social media.” Imagine our shock over this “revelation”, right?
Not to be outdone, Soc Villegas, Archbishop of Lingayen-Dagupan in Pangasinan and former president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), posted an “open letter” to Aika Robredo on Facebook assuring her that “God has your back secured and safe.” Villegas also promises her; “When I lift the Host and chalice in all my Masses this Holy Week, I will also lift you up to the Lord.” This is the same Villegas who had earlier effectively given the Church’s blessings to Filipinos who wish to sell their votes to back a similar assurance Robredo had given to a community of domestic helpers. God is, indeed, on the side of the Yellowtards.
So, if there is, indeed, a sex video of Aika Robredo circulating all over the Net, one would have expected at least one of the chi chi “journalists” of the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media organisations to at least perform a forensic examination of said evidence. In any case, simply uncritically quoting a public personality and packaging that as “news” without corroborating from a third party is just plain lazy. Honesty, after all, is a lot to ask of a community the members of which have become among the least-trusted “professionals” in an industry clearly in its twilight years.",Politics
“It was me in the sex video”: Why did Aika Robredo delete her tweet?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/it-was-me-in-the-sex-video-why-did-aika-robredo-delete-her-tweet/,"Aika Robredo, daughter of Opposition Yellowtard presidential candidate and current “vice president” Leni Robredo finds herself yet again in the midst of another media circus. An old tweet of hers had surfaced that seems to have been fielded at the time woke hashtag #EveryWoman was “trending” on social media. The tweet very likely makes reference to a purported sex video “scandal” then Senator Leila De Lima was allegedly involved in and this tweet of Robredo very likely was made to jump on the bandwagon of expressing “solidarity” with the disgraced senator.
Curiously, the tweet which would have been accessible here seems to have been deleted. Speculation is now running rampant over why Ms. Robredo would delete what seems to be a tweet made in the context of a fashionable woke activist movement at the time. Indeed, Abigail Valte who served as Deputy Presidential Spokesperson for the late former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III was one of the bozos who jumped onto this “trending” bandwagon, issuing the same scripted tweet.
Evidently, being a fashionable sort of tweet at the time, woke Yellowtards had been busy parroting the same text all over Twitter — which all the more makes mysterious Ms. Robredo’s motives for deleting the tweet. It is possible that this deletion followed a recent outrage fad seemingly concocted by the Yellowtards this week to arm them with yet another Victim Card to exploit for political gain. Indeed, this stunt was one enthusiastically amplified by Yellowtard-controlled Big Corporate Media…

Lack of conviction is evidently what is sinking these elections’ Opposition campaign. Filipino voters are seeing through the consistent inconsistency of the ideological foundations of the Yellowtard “cause”.

Presidential candidates Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko” Moreno together with Senators Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, and former Defense Secretary Norberto Gonzales held a press conference to clarify, contrary to rumours circulating, that they are not withdrawing from the Presidential race. They also emphasised that Robredo’s camp is the source of the disinformation about their supposed withdrawal from the race.
While there were only three Presidential candidates present in the press conference, Senator Manny Pacquiao and former Presidential Spokeman Ernesto Abella both of whom couldn’t join them were in agreement with this move to expose the deceit being engaged in by Robredo’s camp. The Presidential candidates decided to hold a press conference to put a stop to the pressure being put on them to withdraw. They are concerned that their supporters are being misled into thinking that they are withdrawing.
The Presidential candidates in the press conference all admitted that they were being offered money to withdraw and support Robredo. Moreno even reportedly said that Robredo’s camp had been asking them to make the “ultimate sacrifice” and withdraw. Moreno stated that asking them to withdraw is an insult and suggested that Robredo should be the one to withdraw and make this “ultimate sacrifice” she is advising them to do.
Moreno came across like he was really annoyed at Robredo for asking him to withdraw. He also said that Robredo only ran because she has a personal grudge against Marcos. Her camp’s style of demonising the Marcoses evidently did not even work so he is suggesting Robredo should withdraw instead. Moreno added that at least he and the other candidates have something to offer the Filipino people whereas Robredo’s only goal is to beat Marcos. This is likely to be true because Robredo’s win in the 2016 election will be scrutinised once again. People are already asking where the people who voted for her then have gone. Her loss in the Presidential race will validate some people’s belief that her win as Vice President is the result of electoral fraud. Robredo doesn’t want to lose against Marcos because that would be embarrassing for her. Her decision to run is purely for selfish reasons and a lot of people can see that.
Moreno is correct in saying that asking them to withdraw and give their support to Robredo is insulting. It’s presumptuous and tantamount to bullying. Robredo regards her fellow candidates as mere nuisances. What makes Robredo’s camp think that all the votes intended for the other Presidential candidates on the tail end of the popularity surveys will automatically go to Robredo? If the voters really wanted to support Robredo, they would have chosen her from the beginning. Most of the voters who chose to support other Presidential candidates are doing it because they use their heads and they are obviously tired of the Liberal Party candidates. They are not the type of people who will just do what they are told. Norberto Gonzales also said this during the press conference. He said that there is no guarantee that his supporters will go to Robredo even if he withdraws.
Moreno went further to say that Leni’s camp is full of lies and propaganda. He recalled that in a meeting with Robredo before the filing of certificate of candidacy, she swore that she wasn’t running for the Presidency and was simply seeking unity. He was genuinely surprised when she eventually filed her candidacy to run. Moreno is of the opinion that Robredo’s character is questionable and cannot be trusted.
It’s baffling to think that Robredo’s camp still thinks that this tactic of asking other candidates to withdraw will work considering former Presidential aspirant Mar Roxas did the exact same thing in 2016. Back then he also asked other Presidential candidates in a press conference to withdraw and unite against then leading presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte. Of course no one backed out. If the call for so-called “unity” against the most popular candidate didn’t work then, what makes them think it will work now? And why is it always the Liberal Party candidate who should remain in the race? They really think they are God’s gift to the Filipino people!
It’s such a shame mainstream media is not making more noise about the explosive revelations the other Presidential candidates shared in their press conference. The candidates were basically saying that Robredo is planning to wreak havoc if she loses to Marcos and that she will not accept the will of the people expressed through these elections. They strongly implied that Robredo is in bed with terrorist groups particularly parties most associated with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). At one point, Robredo even warned that there will be chaos if she doesn’t win the Presidency. It means we can expect career protesters on the streets again shouting those usual “democracy is dead” slogans if Marcos wins.
The journalists who were in the press conference couldn’t comprehend the purpose behind the press conference. Most of them kept asking the same questions. They couldn’t seem to think outside the box. They kept asking if the Presidential candidates in the conference are willing to withdraw to unite behind one candidate. It’s like they all believe that, of course, it is natural to be against Marcos. They couldn’t seem to understand why the other candidates would not agree to withdraw! It’s not surprising considering a lot of members of mainstream media are allied with the Liberal Party and believe in the so-called “EDSA spirit” even though it had already been debunked as a sham.
Senator Vicente “Tito” Sotto had to explain the agenda in plain language so that journalists would stop repeating their questions. The Presidential candidates want Leni’s camp to stop pressuring them to withdraw.  Sotto and his fellow Opposition candidates emphasised that they will support legitimate election results even if Marcos wins and they will fight for an honest election.
Senator Lacson also reiterated that Robredo’s camp should stop subverting the electorate. He said that he will join the fight against the people threatening the peace and security in the country just because they cannot accept the result of the election.
Robredo’s supporters are now summarily dismissing the claims of the other Presidential candidates against her as plain instances of “misogyny” and “toxic masculinity”. The fact is, these men did not use Robredo’s gender as a cornerstone of their arguments and were respectful in the manner with which they raised their concerns. However, Moreno did point out that they were reluctant to speak out against Robredo in the past because she is a woman. That was likely in considering that gender is an actual cornerstone of the Robredo campaign and therefore a space the men found themselves tiptoeing around all that time. Indeed, it had reached a point where they just had to collectively speak out against her camp’s modus operandi of emotional blackmail. Playing the Victim Card is a pillar of the Robredo campaign and asserting that she is being attacked just because she is a woman is their weapon of choice.
One thing is for sure, Robredo is such a bully and a narcissist for demanding other candidates to withdraw just so she can win. She needs a lesson in humility. If this press conference dedicated to exposing her lies and deceit doesn’t help her realise that she is going too far with her ambition and selfishness, then hopefully losing the election will.",Politics
Declassified CIA dox reveal Cory Aquino blamed CPP-NPA for human rights abuses in 1988,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/declassified-cia-dox-reveal-cory-aquino-blamed-cpp-npa-for-human-rights-abuses-in-1988/,"Documents publicly-available from the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) website detail reports on human rights violations that allegedly occurred under the administration of President Cory Aquino. The documents, dated between the 15th and the 29th December 1988, cite reports issued by London-based Amnesty International that assert that incidences of torture perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “have increased since the Manila government stepped up its counter-insurgency campaign against Communist rebels”.
The CIA report also quotes then President Aquino who, in her official response to Amnesty international, defends her government and points to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) as the more culpable party involved in any human rights abuse happening in the Philippines.
A report on militant organisations published on the Stanford University website describes how the CPP-NPA is founded on the premise that China is the source of both ideology and resources to effect violent revolution in the Philippines. The report also shows the history of the CPP-NPA’s efforts to solicit support from other terrorist organisations around the world.
From its 1969 establishment until the 1976 normalization of Philippine-Chinese relations, the CPP-NPA received support, weapons, and funds from China. However, even though the CPP-NPA modeled its armed struggle on China’s own Maoist movement, Chinese support for the CPP-NPA seems to have been limited. The CPP-NPA also sought support, weapons, funds, and training from like-minded groups overseas, including the Japanese Red Army (JRA), the Maoist factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the Sandinistas, the Communist Party of El Salvador, and many other organizations…
Most disturbing of all is the account of the Stanford report of events that sealed the record of the CPP-NPA as an enemy of the state as well as the baffling way that its current ally, the Liberal Party (today known as the Yellowtards), contributed to the twisting of facts that led to a confused record of these events.
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
Even back then, the confused nature with which the Philippines’ political leaders respond to clear acts of terrorism was on exhibit. Rather than be unified across partisan interests in condemning a bald atrocity perpetrated by a Cold War enemy the Liberal Party, instead, blamed the attack on the government of then President Ferdinand Marcos.
Liberal Party members blamed President Marcos for the attack, which had killed much of his opposition. Marcos, who blamed the CPP-NPA for the bombing, responded by suppressing leftist political activity and suspending habeas corpus. These measures marked an increase in Marcos’ power. In response to Marcos’ repression, hundreds of student recruits joined the CPP-NPA. [27]  [28] Meanwhile, Sison denied that the CPP-NPA had been involved in the attack.
Things haven’t changed much in the last half-century since.
Today, it is interesting how the current Yellowtard-led Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders.
Indeed, the Yellowtards and their presidential candidate “vice president” Leni Robredo are in bed with legal front groups of the CPP-NPA as they mount a campaign to prevent the rise of leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte. They use the buzzword “red tagging” to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside.
Former Rep. Neri Colmenares who chairs Bayan Muna, one of the legal fronts of the CPP-NPA, is a staunch supporter of Robredo’s bid for the presidency. Not surprisingly, Colmenares would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding with regard to the CPP-NPA’s terrorist activities. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate.
Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections.
“One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent).  That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino.
“The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added.
LOOK: The Makabayan coalition came in full force for presidential bet VP Leni Robredo at the ""Pink Sunday"" rally. Senatorial bet Neri Colmenares was at Quezon Memorial Circle, but he wasn't able to go up on stage as he isn't officially part of Robredo's slate. @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/OhmX4XFr0H
— Mara Cepeda (@maracepeda) February 13, 2022
Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat.
According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda.
He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate.
Note that Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case. These have since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building.
That Yellowtard figurehead Leni Robredo, purported “leader” of the Philippine Opposition today, would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like Colmenares as “partners” in “building a nation” smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of Yellowtardom Cory Aquino herself battled these terrorists.

The Marxist-Hegelian Religious Cult and Wokeness,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/09/marxism-wokeness-religious-cult/,"I have previously spoken of Marxism in brief as a religious cult. Perhaps it needs a more in-depth explanation since it is a very interesting and controversial subject. It will be based on the explanation provided by James Lindsay of New Discourses who in turn was informed by philosopher Eric Voegelin.
Hegelian National Religion
It starts with the philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel (who drew also from Jean Jacques Rosseau – touched on in another article) who Lindsay argues is actually a theologian. Careful study of Hegel’s works and some pages from Marxist.org show that Hegel was trying to create his own religion based on Gnostic beliefs. Since he was a rabid German nationalist and statist, he was trying to create a German state religion (Germans seem to be often at the center of these things).
To recall, Hegel combined dialectic with Hermeticism or alchemy. Alchemy believes that gold is simply hiding beneath all substances so you have you burn off these substances to reveal it. Hegel believed that the world was like this but, instead of gold, shards of God are being recovered.
God is actually imperfect according to this idea and he is still forming himself by recovering his shards from creation. The recovery is being carried out as the material world wears away, which occurs through dialectic, conflict and destruction. For example, when people are killed and nations fall (Hegel said, “history uses people and then discards them”), the shards are uncovered and they return to God.
All this works towards God’s realization as the Absolute Idea. This explains Hegel’s Historicism, the belief that history follows a fixed or predestined path. At the end of history, when God realizes himself, a perfect Utopia will be realized on Earth. Along with this will come the perfect German state – perhaps also meaning that the German state will be the world-ruling empire (now you know where World War 1 and WW2 come from).
Hegel has his own version of the trinity, the Dialectic Trinity. As interpreted by Lindsay, the Idea is the Father, the State is the equivalent of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit is Geist or the Spirit. The dialectic process makes the Idea (father) go through the State (son), the state’s practice goes through the spirit, then the spirit revolutionizes the Father, and on and on until the end is achieved.
Gnostic Marx
Karl Marx, one of the Young Hegelians, a group of Hegel’s students, was a materialist and against the concept of God. So he reworked Hegel’s ideas into a materialist version. Instead of God realizing himself, humanity is becoming God using the dialectic process. The shards within creation idea was reworked into seeds of a perfect Utopia hidden within man. The problem is was how to uncover the seeds.
Marx believed that all the foundations of the Western world, including Christianity, individualism and private property, were obstructions to the seeds. They were considered the equivalent of the Demiurge, the enemy, if we were to apply Gnostic belief directly. They are contradictions that must be eliminated according to the dialectic method. This means that people should be killed (again, “history makes use of people and discards them”) to remove the obstructions. After this, the seeds would emerge and allow the true God for Marxists, communist humans, to emerge and bring about Utopia. Voegelin called this outcome the Immanentization of the Eschaton.
Marx’s own Trinity has Man (the realized Socialist or Soviet Man, not Man is he is today) as the Father, the State as the Son and Society (carrying on the geist) as the Holy Spirit. Despite using material concepts, Marxism retains the Gnostic process. It also means that Marxism isn’t a transcendent idea above all previous things but only a product of imperialist and religious ideals.
Seeing Marxism as a Gnostic religion seems incredulous for some, while others will say, this is simply a strawman by critics. They will say, Marxism is only a political, economic and social organization framework, not a religion. But a framework that encourages violent overthrow seems a lot more than just a framework. Also, it expects people to behave in a certain way upon implementation of a certain system, such as abolishment of private property. Based on scientific data obtained since then, that expectation is now known to be mistaken since people are not automatic.
Also, I believe this reading of Marxism as a religion by Lindsay holds a lot of water. He is quoting their own literature, such as Marx’s 1844 Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts and Marxists.org articles. His interpretation is informed by people who saw those connections before, like Voegelin and C.S. Lewis. Marx himself in Capital appears to use the word alchemy in a way that belies his believing it. Also, people like Hegel and Marx believing in alchemy isn’t far-fetched, because Isaac Newton, who existed in the same time period as Hegel and we know as a scientist today, started out as an alchemist. This was after all a time when religion was being rejected and scientists and philosophers were bent on creating alternatives to religion in explaining reality (remember Theosophy and Madame Blavatsky?).
It did lead to the establishment of the empirical sciences, because of which we now know that alchemy is wrong. Anything based on alchemy is more like quack science. That also means alchemy-based ideas are in error and should have been dropped as such. This includes Marxism.
But Neo-marxists continue to cling to their ideas, which Lindsay calls an act of faith. In fact, the Communist Manifesto’s original title in drafts was the Communist Confession of Faith.
The Gnostic Problem
Why pick on Gnosticism, some will say. Am not I just pushing my bias onto it, am not I insulting freedom of religion? Well, we have the right to criticize the content. Christianity, which I identify with, focuses on love and caring for others. Christians see God as supreme because if man sets themselves up as God, that’s where the evils and atrocities start from. When Christians murder and torture people, they are not following the faith.
Gnosticism’s central belief is that all of the material world is evil as it was created by the big baddie, the Demiurge. So it implies that one should “burn the world” to purge the evil of the Demiurge to reach the spiritual (Hegel’s recovering the shards). This evolved into the vehemence of Marxism’s purveyors and their willingness to kill or torture people. Also, my impression of Gnosticism is that it sees individual free will as an aberration that must be destroyed, with each individual will to be absorbed into “God.” In contrast, Christianity recognizes individuality as an unimpeachable reality of humanity.
Christianity, when interpreted correctly, accepts that the power to change nature and reality is out of humanity’s hands, which is why a supernatural God is relied on. Gnosticism led to the belief that reality can be altered by material beings; basically, Man is God.
From Religion to Wokeness
The ideological trail of Marxism into the 21st century led to a mixture with postmodernism, and so we get the various “theories” that include Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Gender Theory and all other things called “woke.”
“Woke” turns out to mean being awake to a higher consciousness, which Marx wrote about. That consciousness is needed to realize the Marxist religion’s goal of “transforming” the world or remaking reality, which in turn is the essence of ‘praxis’ or practice. Notice how woke people like to change their genders, pronouns, identities, have sex change surgery, etc. This is considered by Neo-Marxists to be the path to higher consciousness.
But everyone has to be brought together into the higher consciousness or else the perfect world will never materialize. So in order to do this, the wokes attack everyone who disagrees with them and “cancel” them, meaning, trying to shut them off from basic services and their right to live – basically carrying out Marxist dialectic.
This is also why the hard leftist crowd often calls certain things constructs (social constructionism). They think reality is just a construct. How people see themselves is just a construct, male and female are not biological truths but constructs, a family is just a construct etc. Once they reach a higher “consciousness,” they can reconstruct reality.
But to Lindsay, to me, and to all those who are grounded on logic and common sense, all these wokes and Neo-Marxists can create is a pseudo-reality. What they want will never become real, although they’ll try and force it to be. Since their ideas are pre-scientific, they are detached from reality and, therefore, dangerous.
If I were told, religions and ideologies are constructs anyway, I would say that the constructs that justify killing people are the dangerous ones. I would certainly choose the construct that doesn’t make you destroy the world.
Some people will still find this Hegelian-Marxist-Gnostic Religion connection to modern wokeness incredulous. I will show in a later article more on this connection.",Politics
The WEF Great Reset: The true Conspiracy Theory?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/great-reset-true-conspiracy-theory/,"I know I previously wrote something to dismiss certain conspiracy theories such as those on the Illuminati and the Freemasonry. However, I did not dismiss the notion that certain people are still seeking totalitarian power over the world or something near it. It’s just that the real groups do not work like those in the older theories. And… they’ve been in plain sight for some time already.
Among those things that got my attention on Youtube lately (based on the algorithm of my watch history, of course) were the videos mentioning that sinister-sounding line:
“You’ll own nothing. And you will be happy.”
This line is actually found in a video by the World Economic Forum titled “Eight predictions for the world in 2030” which was released a few years back, but has since been taken down because of adverse reactions. It has been connected to the WEF’s  “Great Reset” plan that is apparently already being put into action.
“Debunkers” have been saying that the “own nothing” statement is just predictions, not plans. However, why was the predictions video made at all? Isn’t it that predictions are also made to introduce certain plans? I remember videos made in the 1920s, 1960s and other earlier times about predictions of the future. They actually feature concepts that companies plan to implement. So the things in WEF’s Eight predictions video may not be the organization’s actual plans, but they might still be based on someone else’s real plans.
Perhaps it could have been better worded as “You don’t need to own anything to be happy, because you can rent…” But even though, it’s still a bad idea… and owning nothing sounds like, well, Communism.
It’s interesting that a certain Forbes article written by a WEF contributor seems to show some slippage of worries about the predictions:
“Once in a while I get annoyed about the fact that I have no real privacy.
Nowhere I can go and not be registered.
I know that, somewhere, everything I do, think and dream of is recorded.
I just hope that nobody will use it against me.”
Pretty weird to put in an article to promote the WEF’s plans, isn’t it?
But what is the WEF? It is a non-government and lobbying organization founded by engineer and Bilderberg Group member Klaus Schwab. Politicians and rich businessmen are among the members. Its main initiative at the moment is the Great Reset, a series of policies aimed at sustainability, preparation for pandemics, peace and others. Or so the organization claims. Measures includes banning certain “un-green” substances, increasing government regulation on private finances, possible universal mandation of vaccination… you get the drift.
Some people may say, wait, there’s no conspiracy here! It’s a well-meaning movement! It’s trickle-down economics, redistribution, rich helping the poor, preventing disease, saving the environment! Yes, it’s not a conspiracy theory as we know it. But well-meaning? Helping the poor? It’s likely to be none of that and more like “the road to hell is paved with good intentions.”
Things have been happening recently that indicate that the Great Reset might not be a good idea. First, look at Sri Lanka. What caused its default in loans is not the so-called “Chinese debt trap,” because Sri Lankans were borrowing from many sources and not only Chinese. Corruption is one thing that is certain, and another is tax cuts gone wrong. But many analyses mention the recent policy of banning non-organic fertilizer as part of green initiatives as a major factor. These fertilizers are needed for the farming industry to have high yields, not to mention food on the table. This worked with other factors to make Sri Lanka less productive and thus more susceptible to its loans. People are taking note of this and saying that green initiatives such as fertilizer bans may not be a good idea after all.
Another place where the fertilizer ban is a huge concern is the Netherlands. If you’ve seen the farmer protests on video, you know they’re riled up because they think their livelihood is being threatened. Some Netizens who support green initiatives might support the Dutch government and berate farmers for using non-green methods. But this is hypocrisy.
Activist Vandana Shiva in an interview by Youtuber Russell Brand said that certain companies are the ones actually seeking to push the ban on artificial fertilizers, but they are also the same companies that pushed the fertilizers in the first place. You push them on the farmers then you tell the farmers to stop using them, or else you’ll punish them. Sounds crazy. It looks like the companies are actually trying to sabotage smaller farmers and other workers. The farmers felt unfairly singled out as polluters while aviation, cars and construction machines are apparently not noticed.
This is happening not only in the Netherlands; farmer protests are mounting in other parts of Europe, such as Poland, Germany and Italy. Indian farmers protested against the Indian agriculture acts of 2020 from 2020-2021, believing the policies to be disadvantageous to them. The policies were repealed, but the Indian farmers said there is still much to protest about, and the Great Reset may be among those things.
(I wonder though… isn’t it dumb to clamp down on farmers since they’re the ones feeding us? You thought it happened only in the Philippines, but it turns out to be everywhere in the world now)
Actually, think of it this way: one of the Eight Predictions is that humans will be eating less meat and more plant-based food. If you want people to eat more plant food, why ban fertilizers that are for growing this? It sounds counter-intuitive. Also, I don’t like this prediction if it becomes a plan, I still like meat. I also dislike the carbon tax idea and “welcome all refugees” call (as I said in my article about Simon Webb).
There’s reason to suspect certain green initiatives are not all that good. Note the many Youtube videos and articles showing that Electric Vehicles were not as great, or as green, as touted. They have hazardous waste materials such as expired batteries and turn out to be more expensive to maintain than expected. Perhaps the technology will improve later on, but I doubt it can replace internal combustion-powered cars anytime soon. The problem actually is when laws are passed to force people to use EVs.
Also of note are the trucker protests in Canada, which were against mandatory vaccination. Some quarters of the chi-chi Netisphere likely joined in berating these drivers for purportedly increasing risk against Covid. But what is of unique concern is how the Canadian government reacted. The report is that the Canadian government is freezing bank accounts of people contributing to the protests. Isn’t this illegal and a disruption of the people’s right to express grievances? It would be ironic if the chi-chi Pinoy “activists” slam the Philippine government for obstructing the right to protest while cheering on the Canadian government.
But this is what the Great Reset is thought to be all about, greater power for governments to clamp down on people. One expected feature is a worldwide social credit system similar to that being used in China. You are under surveillance and your offenses will be counted. If you are determined to have enough offenses, you can be cut off from services. For example, if you refuse to implement a green initiative or still use fertilizer, your bank account might be frozen. Remember the line from the Forbes article above, “I just hope that nobody will use it against me?”
While I doubt that the Great Reset is a plan to kill off a part of the population (though it can be an unintended consequence… or is it?), I do agree it is something worth questioning and resisting. Little else can be more insulting and intellectually dishonest than a bunch of rich people telling you that they know how to run your life better than you can. They will force their policies on you while claiming that it is good for you and for all mankind. But it’s all just a public relations stunt. They are business people and are more after their own gain. This is a technocracy, which I decried in some of my earlier articles about leaders.
I also recall the World Religions Council I talked about a while back. I see it now as more of a lobby group with similar goals to the WEF, basically imposing their idea of a perfect world through centralized government control. There are clues that Marxists are part of this religions group, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Marxists are actually in the WEF as well.
As I said before, centralized power, including a technocracy, will not only have the danger of being totalitarian but will also increase the risk of massive failure being fatal to a large number of people (I emphasize Mao-era China again). Mere mortals are never perfect and should never run the world (or anything) as if they are. As Zach Weissmueller of ReasonTV said, if we are all on the same boat, when the boat sinks, we all go down. It is better if people are left alone on their own boats. A more decentralized society where each member and small community are free to make their own projects and innovations is more the reason the world moves forward.",Politics
A three decade throwback: the 1992 presidential elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/a-three-decade-throwback-the-1992-presidential-elections/,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr had recently finished his first State of the Nation Address last month. Numerous analysts have lauded the president’s speech for showcasing what technocracy really is, most specially when he has enumerated his legislative agenda that should be prioritized by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Hopefully, Marcos Jr’s six-year term will guide the Philippines beyond these tumultuous times. Nevertheless, it’s a good time to rewind and analyze the presidential elections held exactly thirty years ago, which definitely led to various political, economic, and social repercussions that the country is currently experiencing.
The 1992 Philippine presidential elections was the first general elections held under the 1987 Constitution. Six years after the conclusion of the 1986 EDSA revolution, the Filipino electorate chose one president, one vice president, and 24 senators in national positions. The top twelve senators ended up serving for six years, while the next twelve were only for three years. These elections held the promises of the aforementioned revolution, which turned out to be broken promises due to the Philippines’ systemic and structural flaws, which were further exacerbated by the faulty constitution.
To contextualize the situation of the Philippines during the Corazon Aquino administration years, the whole country was experiencing various socio-political and economic problems. Political stability was nearly absent as the military, most specially from the members of the Reformed Armed Forces Movement (RAM), which mounted a number of coup d’état attempts against the government. Perennial energy shortages also didn’t help as regular blackouts dampened productivity of Philippine companies. In addition, servicing debt was a tedious task because of the great devaluation of the Philippine peso during the 1980’s. Institutionalized graft and corruption in both public and private sectors created more discontented Filipinos as poverty continued to dehumanize families.
Leading to the presidential elections of 1992, then-President Corazon Aquino decided not to vie for the presidency. Instead, seven candidates who held considerable influence in the Philippine political arena ran for the aforementioned position. These seven candidates can be roughly associated to two groups. Out of those seven candidates, five presidentiables can be classified under the Aquino administration, while the remaining two can be labeled under the opposition. The five administration-aligned candidates were Vice President Salvador Laurel, Senate President Jovito Salonga, Speaker Ramon Mitra, Agrarian Reform Secretary Miriam Santiago, and the eventual winner, National Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos. The remaining two opposition-aligned presidentiables were business magnate Danding Cojuangco and former first lady Imelda Marcos.
Paired with their vice presidential candidates, all of these presidentiables had their own respective provincial bailiwicks. Survey frontrunner Miriam Santiago had Western Visayas, while opposition candidates Danding Cojuangco and Imelda Marcos had Central Luzon and Northern Luzon respectively. In addition, Salvador Laurel had Batangas, Ramon Mitra had Palawan, while Fidel Ramos had Pangasinan. However, various surveys were initially pointing that Miriam Santiago is poised to claim victory, since she had popular support from various sectors of the society. The youth aggressively backed her candidacy, together with the Ilonggo diaspora in Mindanao. Businesses who benefitted from her no non-sense approach as immigration commissioner tacitly supported her. Her feisty character and unquestionable competence, paired with her increasing media exposure in uncovering corruption issues and abuses made her a sellable product in the eyes of most Filipinos.
Even though Sec. Santiago was technically a part of the government, the Aquino administration disliked her calls for reform, most specially during her tenure in the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). These conflicts-of-interests on the side of the Aquinos and Cojuangcos led to the said secretary leaving the cabinet. Later on, then-President Corazon Aquino confirmed her support in favor of the candidacy of Department of National Defense (DND) Sec. Fidel Ramos, where political pundits say that Pres. Aquino’s blessing was basically returning the favor towards Sec. Ramos for addressing the numerous coup d’états and military takeover attempts against her government.
Fidel Ramos, boasting a lengthy military and political career, was seen initially lagging in various surveys. A military-man by profession, General Ramos was indispensable in the administrations of presidents Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino. Nevertheless, his leap towards Malacañang was also faced with difficulties when the “Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino” (LDP) nominated then-Speaker of the House Ramon Mitra as the party’s official standard bearer. This led him to bolt from LDP and made his own political party, Lakas-CMD. Together with his massive political machinery, rich military background and Pres. Aquino’s support, he eventually won the presidency with roughly a fourth of the total votes cast, albeit with various election-related irregularities, which would include allegations that Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi provided financial support in millions of pesos towards his campaign.
If all numbers were taken into consideration, all of these candidates had good chances in winning the race towards Malacañang, including Liberal Party candidate Jovito Salonga and Nacionalista Party candidate Salvador Laurel, as long they were able to consolidate these various groups that they were initially aligned with. However, the complete polarization and disintegration of these groups demonstrate how Philippine politics never allowed the creation of grounds to unite nor set their differences aside. In turn, this created a series of presidencies where candidates only needed to win the most number of votes through plurality, instead of garnering a majority of votes. This trend was broken by President Marcos Jr’s electoral victory last May.
Aside from the reality that the assembled coalition to confront then-President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 crumbled in 1992, it can be observed that political parties in the Philippines are mere vehicles for politicians in winning elections. Philippine political parties are no longer about ideologies nor platforms, but instead institutionalized the careers of politicians who surfed the ebbs and flows of public sentiment. The 1992 elections showed to us that the two main political parties in the Philippines through the Nacionalista Party and Liberal Party have greatly weakened, but still hold a degree of influence in Philippine politics. Santiago’s People’s Reform Party (PRP) and Mitra’s LDP still occupy seats in the Congress, but Ramos’ Lakas-CMD and Cojuangco’s Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) have continued to exert significant influence. This can be observed with the current Vice President Sara Duterte’s alignment towards Lakas-CMD and NPC occupying five Senate seats. Albeit having no representatives in both the Congress and Senate, Marcos’ Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) has her son as the country’s current chief executive.
Unfortunately, the 1992 presidential elections was a testament to the failure of creating inclusive political institutions by the 1987 constitution. Ideally, competent statesmen and stateswomen like Miriam Santiago and Salvador Laurel should have been presidents in this country. These kinds of individuals definitely know how to run a government. Sadly, their names would be lumped together with the likes of Carlos P. Romulo and Claro M. Recto in Philippine history as the best presidents that the Philippines never had.",Politics
What the Philippines can learn from the late Shinzo Abe,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/what-the-philippines-can-learn-from-the-late-shinzo-abe/,"The assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the campaign period in Nara Prefecture sent shockwaves all over the world. In broad daylight while publicly expressing his support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he was shot from behind using a handmade gun. He was rushed to the nearest prefectural hospital but was declared dead roughly five hours after the incident. Japanese mainstream and social media were filled with news regarding the shooting of a former prime minister, stunning the world with gun-related violence in one of the most peaceful countries on the planet. Needless to say, Japan is a country in mourning. Japanese citizens are paying their deepest respects to Japan’s longest serving head of government after the Meiji Restoration.
As the longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, Shinzo Abe’s long political career yields many lessons to learn from. Hailing from a political dynasty that goes back way before Imperial Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, the late prime minister was colloquially labelled as a “thoroughbred”, referring to his political family pedigree. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi was a former prime minister and his father, Shintaro Abe was the foreign affairs minister of then prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980’s. His brand of leadership is an oxymoron, which can be described with contradictory adjectives. With his visits to a Japanese war memorial in Yasukuni Shrine and for formalizing the Quad and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP), he was both a nationalist and a globalist. For actively opening up Japan to trade, labor, and tourism while being prudent in exercising state powers, he can be called as a liberal and as a conservative. Japanese politics expert Tobias Harris has succinctly found the exact word to describe the late prime minister: an iconoclast.
However, his long term in office was not without its fair share of controversies. The highly publicized “Moritomo Gakuen” scandal, which implicated his wife Akie Abe, suddenly caused the drop in then Prime Minister Abe’s approval ratings. Also, the annual ceremony called “Sakura wo Miru Kai” sponsored by the prime minister’s office was flagged for its financial and budgetary irregularities. Finally, the faulty execution of Japan’s early Covid-19 policy, most specially with the “Abenomask”, generally generated negative reactions in the Japanese public. These unresolved national-level issues paired with his worsening gastrointestinal disease eventually led to his resignation. His untimely demise had unfortunately created more questions than answers in modern-day Japanese politics and society.
As the party leader of LDP, the late prime minister was highly supportive of changing or amending the provisions of the 1947 Japanese constitution. This American-backed pacifist constitution established a unitary parliamentary system of government. The most controversial portion of the current Japanese constitution is Article 9, which states that Japan will renounce war as a sovereign right. This was included in the aforementioned constitution, specially with Imperial Japan’s bellicose actions that led to the Second World War. However, geopolitical dynamics of the Pacific are changing drastically and threats to security of the Japanese islands are present. As the only country devastated by two nuclear attacks, having Russia, North Korea, and China at one’s doorstep will make any country feel uneasy. With these imminent threats imposed by these nuclear-armed nation-states, Shinzo Abe advocated for changing this restrictive constitution to address these national insecurities.
Similar with the late prime minister, Filipinos should welcome and take the necessary steps in changing the provisions of the 1987 constitution. Even though the contexts in amending the 1947 Japanese constitution and the 1987 Philippine constitution are completely different, the constitution sets the tone as to what kind of institutions are to be created. This constitution should be amended in accordance to the needs, challenges, and future threats that a country might face. As what US President Thomas Jefferson also advocated, the highest law of the land should be rewritten roughly every two decades. This highlights that constitutions are not meant to last forever in its original form, but must evolve together with the state and society.
Right after his death was publicly confirmed by the prefectural hospital, messages of condolence from various heads of states and governments poured into Japan. Japanese nationals from all walks of life offered flowers, beverages, and prayers to the late prime minister. His official residence in Tokyo, the LDP office near the Japanese Diet, his headquarters as the Representative of Yamaguchi Prefecture’s 4th District, and even the exact location of his assassination in Nara were filled with offerings from ordinary individuals. This explains how Japan respects public office and their officials beyond politics, which is a remarkable reflection of what mature liberal democracies are ought to become.
In a similar manner, all Filipinos must respect public office, whether one is an elected politician, a bureaucrat, or an ordinary Juan dela Cruz. Burning effigies of public figures, throwing of unnecessary insults and tirades, and instigating civil disorder that is being promoted by these activist groups will not create an atmosphere of political accountability. These provocative actions risk escalation that lean towards violence. Filipinos must be politically mature in decision-making, and let their votes serve as society’s true voice as the basis for political mandate. This “live and let live” attitude is a central tenet for any functioning democracy.
Aside from prayers and messages offered to the late head of government, the current Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida quickly denounced Shinzo Abe’s assassination during the campaign trail. This act of terror is an attack on democracy, as what the current prime minister has mentioned in his public speech. He also called for ordinary citizens to practice their right to suffrage and resist such threats to protect and defend the peoples’ freedoms and democracy itself. Eventually, the sitting prime minister’s political party, the LDP was awarded with resounding victory, together with its junior coalition partner Komeito, even though such electoral victory tasted bittersweet in their perspective.
The Philippines too has its own share of experiences regarding election-related violence, where guns are banned and alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited during elections. These realities paired with a long history about guns, goons, and gold associated with Philippine politics created Filipinos who have lost trust not only in the government, but with democracy. Philippine democracy has always been flawed, but it does not necessarily mean that the country must turn towards autocracy, despite these temptations. Genuine democracy demands greater participation of all sectors of the society resulting to plurality and inclusivity, and Filipinos must entrust themselves in creating a democracy that functions well and will serve the interests of the country. An inclusive democracy begins with people who are capable of defending their freedoms and is paired with a system that preserves such.
Beyond Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s demise, Japan will definitely move forward. The Japanese people learn from the past, but they never let their past alone define who they are as a nation. This noble civilization, both blessed and cursed with its geography and its entailing weaknesses and limitations, has made Japan a resilient country. Fortunately, resiliency is something that we Filipinos know the most.",Politics
Jillian Robredo’s encounter with an Igorot (reportedly) in Baguio City is a cautionary tale on elitist politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/jillian-robredos-encounter-with-an-igorot-reportedly-in-baguio-city-is-a-cautionary-tale-on-elitist-politics/,"The words “let me educate you” may not have explicitly been uttered by “vice presidential” daughter (and confirmed woman) Jillian Robredo. However they may as well have. Robredo can be seen strutting around the Baguio City Market surrounded by an enormous entourage the members of which snapped photos at every opportunity as she stopped and stooped to shake hands with whoever gave her a second look. The spectacle had elitist written all over it and it is an exhibit of a lesson the Yellowtard camp led by Robredo’s mother have yet to learn with just a couple of weeks left in the campaign.
Small surprise then that a local, reportedly an Igorot woman, heckled her. Word on the street is that she scolded Robredo and her entourage for blocking the way in the crowded market. Interestingly, the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media community which would normally jump at every story surrounding the Yellowtard campaign only had this to “report” more than 12 hours after the incident…
‘FOCUS TAYO’
After a heckling incident in Baguio City, Jillian Robredo, the youngest daughter of presidential bet VP Leni Robredo, remained focused and will continue doing house-to-house campaigning for her mother.
“Love you, bunso,” Dr. Tricia Robredo replied in her tweet.
The embattled Yellowtard campaign of leading Opposition candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo had been largely unsuccessful at shedding its elitist skin over months of the campaign period of these elections. This most recent incident is yet another setback to their “cause”. A statement had since been reportedly issued by the Benguet chapter of the Robredo People’s Council.
What does Leni Robredo have to do to fix what is clearly a liability to her campaign efforts? Perhaps they could start with reevaluating the role the three daughters, Tricia, Aika, and Jillian play in this ill-fated endeavour. The sisters aren’t exactly paragons of populist appeal as they personally embody the very elitism that sticks to their mother’s campaign like a rash.",Politics
The 1986 revolution: an overselling cover-up of endemic failures,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/the-1986-revolution-an-overselling-cover-up-of-endemic-failures/,"The movie Maid in Malacanang featured the perspective of the Marcos family on what transpired during the three fateful days that led to then-President Ferdinand Marcos leaving the Philippines. It is definitely a bestseller, raking in hundreds of millions in sales as the movie was being shown in cinemas worldwide. With another Marcos leading the country as the head of the Philippine government, the electorate has basically highlighted just how hapless the 1986 people power revolution really was. From this viewpoint, let’s analyze what made the 1986 revolution an overselling cover-up of political, economic, and social failures in the Philippines.
The usual narrative as to what led to the EDSA people power revolution is the assassination of then-Senator Benigno Aquino in Manila International Airport on August 21, 1983. However, pointing the death of a single man as the last straw that broke the camel’s back is too simplistic. There are economic and political reasons that led to the 1986 revolution. For the economic causes, the first domino piece to fall was the 1979 oil crisis, where the Iranian revolution toppled the leadership of the Persian Shah. Paired with Saddam Hussein’s invasion of the rich Iranian oil fields near the borders of Iraq, it created political uncertainty in the volatile Middle East which led to increased prices of hydrocarbon products. This led to inflation in the United States compelling then-US Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker to aggressively hike interest rates. This action further devalued the Philippine peso and with a greatly depreciating currency, the Central Bank of the Philippines issued these “Jobo bills” to confront this economic malaise. The debt-driven economic growth of the Philippines in the 1970’s put a heavy debt servicing burden on the government as the peso weakened versus the US dollar.
With economic indicators in the early 1980’s working against the Marcos administration, his political support from the various sectors of the society gradually waned. Oligarchic families belonging to the landed gentry were slowly distancing themselves from the president, while militant groups were emboldened and ramped up their recruitment of new members. The political situation became more precarious and unpredictable as state powers turned fraught with Philippine societal sectors colluding to shanghai the government. Aside from these leftist groups spearheaded by the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Marcos-aligned cronies who turned away from the Marcos administration, the Catholic church called on its followers to mount civil disobedience campaign. Marcos-era technocrats also left the sinking ship, and the president’s most influential allies in the military, who were Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile and Philippine Constabulary General Fidel Ramos, publicly withdrew their support. This tumultuous political environment later forced then-US President Ronald Reagan to pull the plug, as what Henry Kissinger has written in his book, Diplomacy.
The bloodless 1986 revolution ended relatively peaceful with the Marcos family deciding to quietly retreat, leaving Malacanang and, later, the Philippines for Hawaii. The EDSA revolution was highly publicized internationally, as it was sold as a trendsetter in overthrowing authoritarian regimes. These individuals who say so enumerate the revolutionary experiences of various European countries in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, glorifying the 1986 revolution as the first domino to fall in countering autocratic governments and its accompanying successes. But, is there something to celebrate about the aforementioned revolution in the Philippines in the first place? Or was it just a celebration created to feed and inflate the egos of Filipinos?
Let’s take a look on what has transpired first in Poland. Right after the downfall of the German Third Reich, Poland was reformed after being sliced into half by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in accordance to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. As a Soviet satellite state, Poland was administered by a USSR-aligned political party where communist policies were followed. However, a trade union named “Solidarity” challenged the Polish state through civil resistance and social movement. Despite the government’s attempt to suppress this movement, public support from the Vatican through Pope Saint John Paul II and the United States eventually pushed for democratic elections, which elevated Solidarity’s leader, Lech Walesa to the presidency. Nevertheless, structural reform in the Polish political economy followed, pushing the country down a continuous economic growth path. Warsaw became one of the European Union’s engine of prosperity and productivity, as it has continuously recorded higher GDP per capita numbers in comparison to the previous years. Observing these inclusive institutions in Poland, it can be said that Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement was a resounding success.
For Czechoslovakia, its popular civil disobedience movement was called the Velvet Revolution, which witnessed the collapse of communist leadership in a relatively peaceful manner. However, it had a grim past through the Prague Spring, where initial attempts to reform Czechoslovakia were suppressed through militaristic means when then-USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev pursued the Brezhnev doctrine, where Warsaw Pact countries were allowed to intervene militarily in the affairs of their own fellow Warsaw Pact nation-states. With the Velvet Revolution, Vaclav Havel became the president and later allowed the peaceful separation of Czechia and Slovakia in 1992. Presently, both Prague and Bratislava are popular tourist destinations in Central Europe and have adopted free market reforms that made them more competitive. Their integration to the EU and to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as member-states show how Czechoslovakia had transformed into mature and formidable countries in Czechia and Slovakia. Needless to say, the Velvet Revolution of 1989 created victors as these nation-states enjoy political plurality that was recklessly managed during the Prague Spring.
Finally with Romania, its autocratic government came to an end when great masses of the people confronted the Ceausescus and subjected them to a military tribunal after which they were executed. Similar with other Warsaw Pact-aligned countries after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, various reforms were performed, albeit achieving mixed results. Even though Bucharest eventually became a member of the EU and the NATO, it didn’t curb their citizens’ desires to leave their country in search for greener pastures. That’s why there are still numerous Romanian migrant workers employed in the service sector of the economies of the United Kingdom and Germany. Despite its attempts to democratize and liberalize, corruption issues in Romania are also running rampant and child poverty is still a major social issue. These dilemmas being experienced by Romania seems eerily similar to that of the Philippines.
All these European countries, as what Charles Tilly in his book Coercion, Capital, and European States, developed through a continuous process of accumulating and concentrating the means of coercion. These countries have undoubtedly experienced the errors of massive power centralization and attempted to correct them beyond those revolutions through economic and political reforms. Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia leapfrogged, while Romania seems to lag, as their economy is still dependent on foreign remittances just like the Philippines. Waging revolutions is only the means for the society to mobilize, not the ends. Revolutions are worthless, unless it succeeds at creating the necessary state and societal institutions. With such, did the 1986 revolution produce inclusive institutions, or did it just end up staging power struggles between politicians and various interest groups?",Politics
A Philippine parliament holds a better future for Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/09/a-philippine-parliament-holds-a-better-future-for-philippine-politics/,"The recent demise of Queen Elizabeth II has been the headlines of all international news agencies. For more than 7 decades, she has served as the head of state of the United Kingdom and other nation states, which includes Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The second Elizabethan era has witnessed Britain decline in power and influence, as various British colonies eventually declared their independence from London. Her reign has seen various American, British, and Russian heads of government, from Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, to Biden, Truss, and Putin. Due to her unwavering commitment to public service, her immense contributions to the British public were well received, including her capacity as the previous leader of the Commonwealth of Nations. The masses of the people in the UK have long identified themselves with the queen, as long queues of locals and even foreign dignitaries pay their respects to her. In addition, she has also been Britain’s most well-respected diplomat in modern history. With the passing of the longest serving British monarch, the UK is a nation filled with both grief and gratitude.
The British monarchy has also their own share of mishaps and controversies in its long history. Colonialism, imperialism, mercantilism, piracy, and slavery left their strenuous marks in global political economy. Nevertheless, the monarchy has served as Britain’s dignified institution, according to Walter Bagehot’s “The English Constitution”. Another institution was also mentioned by Bagehot mentioned in his book, and it is about the British parliament. This efficient institution, where the executive and legislative powers of the government are merged through 10 Downing Street, confronts and tackles the predicaments of the nation. Such brand of British democracy has been copied and adopted not only by its European neighbors, but also by other countries with great success. This leads us to question what makes the UK parliament an attractive system of government.
A parliament is basically an assembly of representatives from various administrative jurisdictions and sectors of the society. It is chaired by a prime minister or a chancellor, and usually serves as the head of the dominant political party. As the chairperson, such politician is raised to this position through consensus, concessions, and consolidation. In a parliamentary system, the executive powers of the prime minister and his cabinet is merged with the legislative powers of the parliament, since they are also legislators hailing from their respective constituencies. Merging these governmental powers are helpful in creating efficient and effective laws. On the other hand, the parliament itself becomes its own device of checking and balancing the administration through the opposition. The formation of a shadow government by the opposition ensures accountability through debates held in the parliament, as they attempt to contest possible excesses of the current administration.
In the Philippines, the country has been following the American style of government through its presidential system. The president acts as the head of state and as the head of government. With the presidential system, executive powers are bestowed to the president, where the chief executive acts separately with the legislative branch of government. This works well when both the president and the majority of the legislators are politically aligned, but wreaks havoc when they act in completely opposite directions. In turn, this can lead to more political volatility and power abuse. These instances have been observed multiple times in the political histories of both the United States and the Philippines. It becomes worse when these politicians harbor political ambitions in vying for higher positions in the government.
These political gridlocks, which are more commonly observed in presidential-type of government systems, has been detrimental as threats of impeaching the president are being entertained in congress. Even though impeachment trials are afforded by the constitution as a check-and-balance mechanism, such issues can be greatly politicized and sensationalized. With such, politicians are incentivized to engage in leveraging themselves to pursue their personal interests, putting accountability in the backseat. Graft and corruption become the names of the game, as chief executives create and device nefarious machinations that purchase the loyalty of these legislators. In such a system, chances of politicians colluding instead of making themselves accountable greatly increase, as rule of law deteriorates to rule by law. This presidential system of government can also be attributed as one of the reasons why the most politically unstable, economically destitute, and societally chaotic countries are in Africa, South America, and Central America.
If the Philippines wishes to rectify the mistakes of the presidential system, it would entail changing the current charter. However, there are numerous pundits who continue to treat the current 1987 constitution as something that should be completely preserved, as if it was made by infallible human beings. In addition, there are individuals who are hesitant in changing the system of government to a parliamentary-type, due to reasons that are related with the current Philippine society. These would include the presence of an undereducated electorate, incompetent and corrupt lawmakers, and political dynasties. These social dilemmas become points of contention why Philippine politics remains dirty and that the parliamentary system should not be adopted, but these problems are mere by-products of an outdated system vis-à-vis the 1987 constitution.
When the eventual great powers of Britain, Germany, and Japan adopted a parliamentary government, did these nation-states have a significant educated or literate populations from the beginning? Initially, males of age from the landed gentry and mercantile groups were the ones afforded with the right to suffrage, and was later expanded to include laborers, women, and the marginalized. It was primarily due to their continued government investment in the fields of education and science that gradually made their cities highly productive. In addition, most of their lawmakers were initially from aristocratic families, who yielded power and influence in their respective localities. As a burgeoning middle class developed, they openly challenged these elites and eventually joined the political ranks in London, Berlin, and Tokyo. Even though various political families still hold a certain degree of influence in their parliaments, it is a far-cry from the semi-feudalistic political system that can be observed in the Philippines, where their political careers end up becoming their own businesses.
Adopting a parliamentary system in the Philippines will not change the whole archipelago overnight. However, it sets the tone in creating state institutions that responds to the needs of the society. A parliamentary system will compel politicians and their corresponding political parties to shape up. But with the country’s lengthy history with directly electing presidents, a paradigm shift would be greatly needed. With a Philippine parliament, there would be more inclusive political institutions that will eventually create an atmosphere of accountability, competence, and receptiveness to the plights of the Filipino people.",Politics
Humanity best give up its search for the Perfect World,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/search-for-perfect-world/,"I recall an address some years back by a Philippine military or police spokesperson to discourage youth from joining the New People’s Army where he advised them to stop dreaming of a perfect world. I find that sound advice that I hope many people will listen to. As I have written, many ideologies and philosophies were thought up since ancient times through the Industrial Age to try and create a “better world” or Utopia. In the end, they create more conflict and lead to more suffering and unnecessarily death, which is well-demonstrated with the case of Marxism.
Activist Charlie Kirk said that the most dangerous person ever is not the tyrant, but the ideologue. These kinds of people believe they know the perfect way by which all humanity must live by. But when the rest of humanity doesn’t agree, they get angry and decide, if you don’t want to join us, perish. To borrow from Hans Morgenthau, ideologues are likely the types who think, “let (my) justice be done, even if the world must perish.” I described their kind as those who want to “save the world” but they actually destroy it. If you think religions are bad, these are worse.
Some people will point out, there are really dumb people, like those who go out during Covid without masks, those who don’t get vaccinated, those who play stupid games to win stupid prizes. These are in the way of our comfort and peace of mind, so ideologies that are for the killing and controlling of these people are justified. Ideologues get mad at the world’s imperfection, they lash out and kill people. But the problems do not disappear. In fact, it only makes the problems of the world bigger.
Way I see it, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx and the Neo-Marxists, and even Jean Jacques Rousseau, thought their “great ideas” can solve the world’s problems. Everyone just needs to follow their awesome ideas to create the perfect world. If you let people run their own lives, they’re bound to mess things up! Nobody’s perfect, as the saying goes, so these “nobodies” need to be controlled by them! But “nobody’s perfect” is itself the reason no one should take complete control of other people, even for supposedly noble purposes.
Then they get so pissed with people not listening to then, in addition how difficult life is. So they thought, the only solution is to bitch about it. Ah heck with it, let’s destroy the world and maybe we’ll wake up one day and find it a Utopia. Things will respawn like in a video game. That’s not how the world works, but the Neo-Marxists and Wokes persist in thinking it does.
As I said in an earlier article, Marxism and similar Utopian ideas appeals to the inner savage, the sinful nature or the nature that makes us think “ah, screw it” and do wrong to others if they contradict. As it is a massive lashing out against reality, Marxism, not religion, is the real “sigh of the oppressed” and “opium of the people,” albeit a misguided and murderous sigh.
I also wrote that one of the reasons for destructive ideologies was misinterpretation of the Bible, namely that part about the Garden of Eden. Eden was thought of as a primitive Utopia where Adam and Eve were irrational savages, giving some ideologues like Rousseau the wrong idea about how a perfect world should be. Other faulty interpretations of this Bible passage include the idea that humanity was supposed to have immortality and be superbeings in the garden, or that Eden was supposed to have free food all the way and no death and pain would exist. And so Rousseau’s and Marx’s means to restore this version of Eden required the murder of millions.
What If
Let’s do a little thought experiment. What if some form of Perfect World actually happens? Let’s say, a world where humans are somewhat immortal and don’t die of disease or other “normal” circumstances. But let’s put in a caveat, such as, they can still be killed. For me, Michael Moorcock’s Dancers at the End of Time novel series provides a good insight into how that will go.
In that story, humans at the end of time have power rings that give them godlike powers. They can fly, resurrect others and travel in time. But they are also so decadent and morally base that they engage in games like depressing another through trickery and, when the victim commits suicide or dies some way, the victimizer will resurrect them to do it again. So they kill each other, resurrect their victim, then repeat. In other words, given Utopian conditions, humans can still abuse and torture each other. I think Moorcock is spot on with his representation of human behavior and it shows why it’s best that humans don’t have superpowers (a point likely also made in the comics The Boys and Marshal Law).
Some will retort, but humans when they gain powers won’t be like Moorcock’s characters. They will change their nature and become naturally selfless and all (what Marx and Engels predicted). I doubt. Reality has shown that while we almost have godly power through some scientific advances, i.e. the power to destroy the world with the atomic bomb or ability to split atoms through a Hadron Collider, human nature remains the same. Advancement in power and technology does not mean advancement in wisdom. This comes from something else, mostly values from religion (updated with post-Enlightenment ideas and recent scholarship) and common sense.
Keeping A Grip on Reality
The world is indeed limited by the laws of reality and it is basically untameable. Perhaps this is the greatest frustration of all. It is difficult to eradicate or even just alleviate world hunger because of the complexities of growing food and hunger being a recurring need. We are subject to disease; I doubt we can eradicate it. We wish we could enjoy sex or do things like plug a fork into an electric socket without consequence, but the consequences are the rule. People have been looking for the fountain of life, trying to be immortal on Earth, which some scientists are likely tinkering with in genetics; but I doubt they’ll crack the code because it may have self-protection against tampering. And so on.
Life isn’t fair, so people seek mystical escapes. Admittedly even in Christian circles, some believe hope for magic powers on this earth. I believe this comes from an aspect of humanity that gives rise to cognitive dissonance (as well as more misinterpretations of Scripture). Humans wish they could better cope with life’s difficulties in a magic way. We wish we could be in two places at once, we wish we could have many arms, we wish we could make things we need magically appear or those we hate magically disappear. Or, we wish we could change other people’s nature and make them serve our needs.
But, sad as it may seem, that will never come true. We can only work within the reality we are in. Life is full of compromises that we have to live with. But this should not make us mad that we lash out against others.
Anti-Entitlement
One of the great lessons in life is that we are entitled to nothing, including the pleasures of life, freedom from all pain, or even the perfect world. But we should not see this as unjust.
Dropping entitlement does not mean giving up hope on making things better. It is accepting that, since we can’t control reality, we should not be vehemently insistent and demanding of what we want, as these tendencies are among the very things that lead humans to hurt others. For example, when you don’t get what you want, like your ideas for a perfect world being implemented by others, you assume that other people are getting in your way and you want to put them away somehow. When it gets to the extreme, you would reach the point where you might want to kill these obstructions.
One of the greatest forms of gaslighting is saying that these “obstructions,” because they are obstructing perfect world ideas that could save people, are murderers. But really, is that connection provable? Isn’t that a slippery slope being applied as an excuse to murder people (and therefore the killers of “obstructions” become the actual murderers)? How can you prove that perfect world ideas will save lives? Is the perfect world really guaranteed by such ideas?
Dropping entitlement will make you not want to kill “obstructions.” It is one of the major milestones in maturity; in my own life, it led me to become less selfish, more understanding and more charitable towards people. One line of the Prayer for Serenity coins the attitude: “accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.”
I daresay that ideologies like Marxism are the product of an entitled attitude. James Lindsay of New Discourses said that Marx often depended on dole-outs by his Communist Manifesto partner Friedrich Engels. When Engels’ wife died, Marx’s consolation letter had only two sentences of actual consolation, while the rest was to the tune of “despite your sadness, keep the checks rolling, buddy.” This is also surmised to be Marx’s frustration with the world, wherein, “these rich guys won’t give me money, so let them all die.” This was expected to lead to the repossession of bourgeosie property, so Marx’s ideas can be seen a modus where he can take others’ property for himself.
Some may say, life can’t be worth living if we live in an imperfect world. This is wrong and is loser mentality. Humanity does have power over their own lives. A key element is understanding that doing good and “fixing things” are not a one time action that will lead to everything being perfect after. It is all continuous action that we must maintain throughout our lifetimes. While we may never have the perfect world, we can still work towards something like it.
Though life is difficult, it should be no reason for us to do wrong to our neighbor. We can help each other not just in the spirit of love of neighbor, but also by the Common Sense that Thomas Paine wrote about. We help each other not because of a social contract or state duties, but because we act upon the common sense to help each other uphold our inalienable rights.
Some people would retort, there are problems with capitalism and classical liberalism too! But the problems are not rooted in capitalism itself. They are rooted in human nature. Ideologies are created from imperfect understanding of humanity and nature. I daresay they are the products of human nature as well. We can’t change other people’s nature, we can only change our own.
Another of the great mistakes of Marxism is the assumption that individual will is the obstruction to a perfect world. Because individual wills often can’t get on the same program, they have to be suppressed or even destroyed. But individual will is a vital component of what makes us human. If individual will is erased and people made into drones, humanity is lost. Marxism and its derivatives are hypocritical; they claim to humanize man more, but they actually dehumanize.
Religion is also important because it helps us cope with our suffering without lashing out irrationally. That’s why Marx hated religion. But not lashing out is still the better decision to make.
The afterlife was probably thought of because Utopia cannot be achieved in the physical world; there is hope of finding it in the other world. Or, if it is to be realized in physical world, only the deity can bring it about. If humans try to bring it about, they will fail. That indeed has happened in history.
Keep “Great Ideas” Capped
When people have a great idea about the world that they feel that they should force everyone else to be on board with them, we should use true critical thinking on them. Are they sure their idea is really great? Will it not result in unintended consequences? Will it infringe on the inalienable rights of people? What will you do if no one likes your idea, will you curse them and think of them as stupid people? If a person thinks that he needs to force others to follow him to make his “great idea” work, you can be more certain that his idea is actually bad.
The belief that humanity can perfect the world is one of the greatest manifestations of its hubris. Humans are capable of thinking up grandiose ideas that involve the whole world, but when they try to put things into action, the law of unintended consequences tends to take over. And yet they don’t back down or reconsider their plan, but try the same thing over and over again hoping it will succeed the next time (Which Marxists and communists keep doing).
Something to think about: when people think of an idea on how to achieve the perfect world, they are actually saying that they themselves are perfect. Because, if you have an idea on creating a perfect world that is supposed to work, the logic is that you yourself are perfect, right? Perfection cannot come from imperfection. So humans who claim that they can create a perfect are equating themselves with God. And when they think of themselves as perfect or God, it often leads to thinking that they have the right over the lives of other people. No mystery as to where that will next lead.
As long as that desire for a perfect world remains, the tendency for violence and the urge to challenge reality will remain. That desire sets us up for failure. So perhaps we should heed that military officer’s advice on acceptance of the impossibility of Utopia. After all, the word Utopia means “no place,” its use by Thomas More signifying that it is impossible to achieve.
I say we should watch out for those people who believe they have the way to make the world perfect. Some praise ideologues as heroes, based on the definition that heroes try to save the world. I disagree. For me, true heroes are the ones who stop those who want to change the world.
My libertarian and “leave people alone” ideas are criticized by others who say, you can’t leave people alone because you have to take control of stupid people. On the contrary, what if stupid people were the ones in control?  Yes, they are capable of taking power. Also, if you really want to avoid stupid people, leaving them alone might itself be the best solution.
There’s this trope where one tells another “you sound like my mom” as a way of saying “don’t interfere in my life” (‘huwag kang makialam’ in Tagalog). This refers to moms, often old-school Filipino moms or parents in general, who I described before as authoritarian. They would try to dictate what you should eat, what music you should listen to, what clothes you should wear, what your opinion should be, etc. They do this of course because they think they know what’s best for their children. The problem with ideologues is that they want to be like this, they want to be your mom. But, as the saying above implies, only your mom can be your mom, and others can’t.
Some may say, I have trust issues if I refuse to listen to idealogues or let the “right leaders” control my life. I’ll turn that around: those who want to control others are the ones with trust issues, because they refuse to trust people to run their own lives, which is the normal.
Giving up the perfect world does not mean giving up on life or goodness. Not trying to reach perfection is not a surrender to evil. The imperfection of physical existence is not evil. It is simply what is. We should just accept our limits and know what we can do within them. Because if we try to defy those limits, we may do more harm than good.",Politics
What is wrong with the Philippine Opposition?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/what-is-wrong-with-the-philippine-opposition/,"Indeed, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. The old adage evidently describes what is likely to be behind the interesting behaviour of the Philippine Opposition nowadays. After a crushingly humiliating rout in this year’s national elections, the Opposition has never been quite the same. It is no longer the revered “force of good” — a brand it once commanded in a conjugal theocracy with the Roman Catholic Church. The once powerful narrative that was forged in a “popular uprising” in 1986 that served as its philosophical underpinning is now an inert relic that lives only in quaint museums erected in desperation within tony private universities and exclusive enclaves by “thought leaders” funded by sponsors with vested interests in the old status quo.
A feeling of entitlement to political power was given a stark reality check by the Filipino people this year and a spurned Opposition has yet to come to terms with that. Unfortunately they choose to deal with this rejection by coming up with a bevy of demons that, they insist, worked against their crusade — “trolls”, “disinformation”, “enablers”, etc. Their attempts to lead Filipinos to believe that behind all these demons is a single leader — current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr — is backed by such fury. To the Opposition, Marcos is the equivalent Great Satan that religious nuts invoke to incite inquisitions, jihads, and terrorist attacks. The fury of the scorned Opposition is indeed upon us. It is fuelled by a lack of personal accountability — personal accountability for the part their political ineptitude played in their own demise.
Unfortunately for the Philippine Opposition, neither fire nor brimstone is raining upon the “evils” of Opposition leaders’ fantasies. At best, their calls to action are heeded only by a minority albeit a noisy one — noisy because they have at their beck and call the Philippines’ mainstream media institutions. The Philippine Opposition need a new strategy that is more effective at reaching and converting Filipinos. More importantly, it needs to step up to the role of providing a good balance to the administration — not just in terms of being contrarian or dissenting for the sake of these, but more as a source of complementing ideas and points of view.
The key challenge for the Opposition camp today is to get over the monumental butthurt of losing an important election that they are evidently wallowing in. Sure, it stings to lose, it hurts to be rejected, and it is hard to get back into the meat market and compete for attention and relevance after suffering a crushing rebuke. Thing is, the latter is what it means to contribute productively to politics (which is a lot different to merely adding noise which is essentially what the Opposition is doing today). You learn from your mistakes instead of defining yourself by those mistakes ad infinitum.
First thing’s first, the Opposition need to get themselves a new and better leader. As long as they continue to latch on to their traditional ones — Leni Robredo who turned their lot into a laughingstock, Leila De Lima who is in prison and is not very telegenic nor tiktok-genic, Joma Sison who is hiding on the other side of the planet, and all the rest who are stained with LOSER forever — the Opposition will never regain their place as mature players in Philippine democracy. Second, they need a new narrative and a new set of friends. The Yellowtard narrative is dead (literally, in fact — as all their “heroes” either lie six feet under or are headed there). Communism is a mere sad relic of the Cold War and is irrevocably associated with terrorism no matter what the suits say. And the ol’ “helping the poor” rhetoric? Filipinos are over that as well or, more to the point, they never really did care about the poor (Filipinos walk by scenes of poverty everyday and hardly raise a fake eyebrow to express even token “concern”). “Concern” for the “poor” is a mere fashion statement that only students of chi chi private Catholic schools could afford to harbour. The assumption that poverty is a key election “issue” had long been debunked as well.
Filipinos deserve a better Opposition and not the one they had put up with over the last three decades and continue to put with today. Is there a group or camp up to the task of building a new proposition for the Filipino people? One that is more forward-looking and less of retrospective fear-mongering one that they are subject to today? Only time will tell and only a wherewithal to aspire to true greatness will see that happen.",Politics
Marcos Jr.’s foreign policy mirrors the Philippines’ realpolitik,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/marcos-jr-s-foreign-policy-mirrors-the-philippines-realpolitik/,"More than a hundred days had passed since Ferdinand Marcos Jr. became the country’s president after his unprecedented electoral victory. As the country’s chief architect of foreign policy, the Marcos Jr. administration has embarked on various foreign travel commitments last September. His first destination was Jakarta, where he met Indonesian President Joko Widodo and discussed various avenues of cooperation between Indonesia and the Philippines. Later, he went to Singapore and met with his Singaporean counterparts, as he attempted to draw in investment pledges for the country. Afterwards, the president spent roughly a week in New York, where aside from his speech in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), he also met up with various businesses, investors, and politicians. All these travel commitments of the current administration in just a month is reflection on how the president will steer the Philippines beyond the tumultuous waves of global politics.
Our neighboring archipelagic nation of Indonesia as President Marcos Jr.’s first destination for his state visit was definitely a pleasant surprise. It is worth noting that both Jakarta and Manila share numerous common interests, where cooperation is of utmost importance. These would include addressing existential threats like terrorism, extremism, and climate change, where both these countries have ended up becoming victims in various occasions. As the two largest Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states in terms of population, economic partnership between Jakarta and Manila holds tremendous potential, most specially when one considers that a market shared by nearly 400 million Indonesians and Filipinos is too difficult for international investors to resist. With Jakarta serving as the de facto leading nation-state in the ASEAN region, developing and maintaining close ties with this country is critical to respond accordingly in the ever changing tides of geopolitics.
Visiting the highly-urbanized city-state of Singapore was also a no-brainer for the Marcos Jr. administration. Aside from the fact that Singapore employs thousands of Filipinos who contribute to various sectors of the Singaporean economy, it also serves as the investment hub of Southeast Asia. This state visit served as a testament not only to the government’s commitment to protecting overseas Filipinos, but also to the government’s active attempts to attract investments to the country. Even though structural and institutional reforms are required in the Philippines to become a more attractive investment option in the region, economic growth and job creation has been the primary objective of the Marcos Jr. presidency, most specially in the manufacturing sector where the country currently lags the most. To facilitate generation of employment opportunities, finding the right balance in incentivizing foreign investors and protecting labor rights of Filipino workers is key.
Why then did President Marcos Jr. choose Indonesia and Singapore as his first two destinations for his state visits and not Washington nor Tokyo, who share deep bilateral relations with Manila? It definitely boils down to ASEAN becoming a more significant regional organization, as the Indo-Pacific region is sandwiched by Beijing and Washington’s strategic competition for resources and influence. With the Philippine head of state affirming his relationships with Jakarta and Singapore, it sends a positive message of commitment to the ASEAN community. Even though it doesn’t have the political clout similar to that of the European Union, the whole ASEAN community is poised to maintain strong economic growth, even though its member-states’ respective state institutions are far from being inclusive in comparison to its European counterpart.
The second half of September of the Marcos Jr. administration was spent in New York City, where he delivered his speech in the UNGA. He mentioned that the Philippines’ wishes to be “friends to all, enemies to none”, where aside from adopting an independent foreign policy, cordial bilateral and multilateral relations between different nations would be pursued through dialogue, cooperation, and mutual trust. He articulated the contribution of the Philippines to this international organization through the actions of the renowned Filipino statesman, Carlos P. Romulo. Aside from that, he has also mentioned three threats to human security, which are food insecurity, energy crisis, and climate change. These three issues that he has mentioned in UNGA are areas where various nation-states can cooperate, as they serve as significant threats that will confront even the sheer existence of these countries, governments, and peoples.
Beyond the United Nations, President Marcos Jr. had also engaged in various meetings inside New York, which would include multinational companies, venture capitalists, and other heads of state. Aside from meeting US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his interview in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was generally well-received. He wooed businessmen to invest in the Philippines, saying that current Philippine demographics paired with the government’s plans to digitize its services, will be greatly beneficial to both parties. Attracting foreign capital as means to utilize local labor is a perfect recipe for a more pluralistic kind of economic growth, which is something that the country direly needs.
As a part of the Philippine delegation, the president brought his economic team in his foreign travel. Despite the various threats that can hamper economic growth, the presence of the economic team is a way of demonstrating the country’s sound economic fundamentals, which include a predictable currency, solid foreign exchange reserves, and low unemployment rate. Engaging with other foreign dignitaries and non-state actors in the field of economics, reflects an evolution of Philippine national policy in the form of economic diplomacy, and this is something that the Philippines can take advantage of.
As a capital-hungry county, the government’s agenda is to prioritize the entry of foreign direct investments, and this becomes further emphasized with the president himself acting aggressively in attracting overseas businesses and corporations. As the Philippines is renowned in the global market for sending human resources abroad, international businesses and other nation-states have greatly realized the importance of Philippine labor. With a relatively low cost of living in comparison to other countries, and with a young workforce coupled with the government’s pledges to continuously invest in infrastructure, everything looks promising for the Philippine economy.
Despite these pledges of investment worth billions of dollars, they are mere promises that should be delivered, and the Philippines has a significant active role to play to see them to fruition. Creating a business-friendly climate entails various systemic and structural changes, if these corporations are to generate employment opportunities for local Filipinos. This begins with economic liberalization by removing these highly restrictive constitutional provisions that discourage the entry of these multinational companies. The 60-40 system when it comes to ownership has been counter-productive because local Filipino businesses were greatly protected from international competition. As a result, they have developed oligopolistic tendencies, and thus, these foreign direct investments instead of going to the Philippines, end up driving the economic growth of other Asian countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. It is no wonder that the manufacturing sector of the Philippines cannot compete with other countries.
Generally speaking, President Marcos Jr. has strategically capitalized on the gains earned from the previous Duterte presidency’s pragmatic approach in foreign policy. This bodes well as the Philippines treads its own independent policy in pursuing, promoting, and protecting its national interests. Hopefully, this tightrope act would deliver prosperity and lift our very own local Filipinos out of poverty.",Politics
Critical Race Theory and Other Critical “Theories:” Snakes in the Grass,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/critical-race-theory/,"Critical Race Theory is a hot topic these days because its purveyors claim that it is good, but we critics of it (pun not intended) say otherwise. CRT claims to address the problem of racial prejudice, which indeed is still a problem in the world. But it uses the wrong approach and in fact is itself racism.
Neo-Marxist Roots and Secret Racism
Pictured is “black rights” icon Angela Davis. She is shaking hands with Erich Honecker, an East German politician who was indicted for ordering the killing of 68 people who tried to escape from East to West Germany. She also provided guns to people who murdered some others during a courtroom incident in 1970. She was imprisoned for this and, after her release, she wanted to abolish prisons. She also voiced support for Jim Jones and the People’s Temple cult. She was a member of the US Communist Party from 1969-1991.
She is one of the progenitors of Critical Race Theory, along with WEB Dubois and Derrick Bell, and is a Neo-Marxist. Her mentor is Herbert Marcuse, one of the New Left or Radical Left I mentioned in the Hegel Dialectic article. She is quoted to have said, “in a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” Her ideas flowed down to Richard Delgado, Kimberle Crenshaw, Robin DiAngelo, Henry Giroux, Ibram X. Kendi and other CRT purveyors.
What connects CRT to Marx and Hegel is the use of the word dialectic. Crenshaw and many other CRT writers and leftists use that word in their writings. As long as someone pushes “dialectic” in their writings, you can bet your bottom dollar that they’re Marxist.
James Lindsay of New Discourses says Marxist ideas went through their own dialectic process. Marx first questioned Hegel then synthesized his own ideas from it. Neo-Marxists, because they saw that no proletariat revolution happened in the west, questioned Marx and synthesized their own ideas afterwards with a mix of Sigmund Freud. Davis and the other people mentioned above ran their own dialectic on Neo-Marxist ideas and synthesized them into CRT and other “theories.”
Back to Davis’ quote, non-racism is simply removing the wrong ideas that say other races are subhuman and applying equal opportunity. This is called incremental or step-by-step progress in the CRT textbook. Anti-racism is claiming that racism exists everywhere and is ‘hidden’ or ‘secret’ if there are no apparent signs of it, so you have to look for it. CRT claims that the foundation of modern society is white supremacy. Any attempt to point out that racism obviously does not exist in a certain case will be tagged as racist itself. Thereby CRT self-protects against any dissent.
For example, if a CRT purveyor sees a white person sitting on a bench and a black person standing beside him, they will say that the black person is being made to stand as a result of racist power dynamics. Even if the reason is that the black person simply paused during a walk to admire the birds, racism is still read into the situation. If you explain that this situation isn’t racist, you will be tagged as racist.
That’s yet another meaning of “Woke.” The “higher consciousness” called “Woke” also means having awakened “racism radar.” They can tell whether another person is secretly racist but other people could not. And you shouldn’t question them because they are always right, because they have the “higher consciousness.” However, sounds like a bunch of bullcrap, right? You bet it is.
Textbook Lack of Logic
Let us look at an excerpt from the CRT textbook, because this is proof that I’m not making things up.
The Critical Race Theory movement (CRT) is a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism and power.
The movement considers many of the same issues that conventional civil rights and ethnic discourses take up, but places them in a broader perspective that includes economics, history, context, group and self-interest, and even feelings and the unconscious.
Unlike traditional civil rights, which embraces incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law.
– Critical Race Theory: An Introduction by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic
In the first paragraph, the CRT textbook says that it is a “movement,” though some CRT teachers have gone on record denying that it is a movement. Next, a key word is “transforming,” which sounds like Marx’s line about changing the world. And “power” is something that Marxist thought obsesses over. As I said in my Hegelian religion article, this “transforming” doesn’t mean improving relations between people but rather changing where power resides. In democracies, which are based on the liberal system, power resides in the people, right? So guess what, CRT purveyors want to undo that.
In the second paragraph, CRT seeks to address the issue from a “broader perspective.” It means that it will overlap into many other subjects – perhaps too many subjects. Especially in the last part: feelings and the unconscious. Neo-Marxism applied Freudian principles about hidden thoughts or whatever hidden things are in people’s minds. This includes racist thoughts. This is why CRT purveyors claim that people can be racist without knowing it: the racist thoughts are purportedly in the unconscious.
The last paragraph is the good part. Quoting Lindsay again, if Critical Race Theory’s purveyors claim that their “movement” is unlike traditional civil rights, they can’t claim that they continue the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.
CRT questions the liberal order: remember that Marxism considers classical liberalism its enemy. The liberal order that recognizes people’s individual rights is also seen as part of the system that creates systemic racism, so CRT purveyors seek to overturn it.
Next, they don’t like incrementalism and step-by-step progress. So the civil rights movement is too slow for them. How do you speed it up? Revolution. Violently overthrow any institution that supports the liberal order.
It questions equality theory: so if CRT purveyors claim to be for racial equality or equality in general, they are not! They say since racism is everywhere, it means that it can’t be removed. So instead of pursuing equality, the goal is to control racism and be the ones to decide who is more equal than others.
CRT is against legal reasoning and neutral principles of constitutional law, meaning it is against the rule of law on the assumption that the law is inherently racist. Also, it is against ‘neutral principles;’ CRT is against neutrality and objectivity (You can link to this the quote “you side with the oppressor if you are neutral“). You can conclude that CRT is against everything because everything is racist, but once they take control of something, it stops being racist.
Then you have questioning of Enlightenment Rationalism. CRT continues not the civil rights movement but the Anti-Rationalism of Jean Jacques Rousseau, from whom Marx drew. Rousseau and his ilk are ruining our world.
In Simon Webb’s words, CRT entails the “dismissal of classical liberalism of the kind which arose with the Enlightenment, rejection of rational and objective enquiry, affirmation of subjective experience, whether in story-telling or personal testimony, sometimes known as standpoint epistemology, and a tendency towards cultural or racial separatism.”
Other “Theories”
CRT is not the only “theory” that makes use of the Marxist playbook, where you take a certain group, claim that it is “oppressed” despite evidence that the opposite is true and say the solution is for the “oppressed” group to take over.
I mentioned Drag Queen Story Hour before, which applies Queer Theory. The claimed purpose is to de-stigmatize drag queens and LGBT to kids. Drag queens are portrayed as an oppressed group. The claimed source of oppression is the institution of the family. Lindsay says the solution that is being pushed is not to incrementally stop “oppression” (if there is any), but to reverse the situation: make drag queens the authority. Drag Queen Story Hour eventually wants to take children away from the family and teach them the “values” of drag queens, teaching them to become drag queens or LGBTs. This system wants to destroy the family. It is similar to the communist system wherein children are taken from families and schooled (groomed) in another environment. The drag queens become a sort of commissar, the political officer or “reeducator” in Soviet terms.
If you don’t believe all this, there is an academic paper that actually says this. This drag queen thing is also sure to be a gateway for pedophiles to take children and sexually assault them.
Lindsay calls Queer Theory worse than CRT, but there is more. Before Queer Theory, there was the Marxist education theorist Paulo Freire, whose wrote that education is just a tool of bourgeosie domination. Freire said that teaching children to read, write and math is a method of keeping them in subjection to the bourgeosie. So instead of teaching actual subject matter, teach them that they are oppressed so that, later on, they could do “activism.” But this activism is not what we know, such as standing up for others’ rights. If you are guessing that it is overthrowing the liberal and capitalist order, you got it right.
Freire also advocated teaching about sex early to children, which Queer Theory seeks to do. Those who know about Freire likely also know that he was kicked out of Brazil and another country because he was messing up their education system. He worked with Marxist priest Dom Helder Camara, who is an inspiration for Pope Francis. But even before him was Gyorgy Lukacs, who became Hungarian minister of education and also wanted early sex education for children. He also ruined his country’s education system.
In the Philippines, does anyone remember that time a leftist lawmaker said, give us your children and we will take care of them? Was it Sarah Elago or Risa Hontiveros? This was the Marxist education premise being mentioned in the open. They don’t want families to raise children, they want their Marxist groups to do it. I do know at least one local leftist who likes Paulo Freire.
Also, remember What is a Woman as asked by Matt Walsh? Why did the people who were interviewed by Walsh have difficulty answering it? Because they do not believe the common sense answer of a woman being an adult female. They believe that even a woman has no right to call herself a woman. At least one interviewee even said that one should consult an expert. But is that expert a biologist? No, it should be a gender expert.
Basically, Wokes want to deprive people of the right to define themselves. First, people will be thinking up their own genders based on weird things going on in their head. But later on, they will have to defer to the gender expert who will act as a commissar, a Neo-Marxist one. You can’t tell people what gender you are, even if you follow nature; the “expert” will tell you what your gender is. Notice how they say, “gender is assigned.” They use that language to insist that people, not nature, determine genders. Based on that, they want to dictate people’s genders and sexes as part of control over society.
Even the anti-meat/die-hard vegan movement is going the Woke way. The CRT purveyors are likely trying to tell the vegans that they’re “oppressed” with all these meat-eaters around. Then they’ll say that the only way is for vegans to take power and ban the eating of meat. Also, I saw posts like “down with dairy companies” on one vegan’s post. But that’s not going to make sense when you realize that those same companies can provide vegan options too. Plus, the dictatorship of forcing others to be vegan is certainly a bad idea.
Another kind of commissar is the Diversity Officer or Diversity Expert in companies. On the surface they claim to make sure minorities are not blocked from employment. But what they are actually doing is stirring trouble up. They look for secret racism using their “woke consciousness;” so if they can’t find it, they’ll make it up. The result is competent people fired for purportedly being racist, frequent fights in offices, and toxic workplaces. People will also leave on their own because of them. Then these Diversity Officers will place in acquaintances who will likely not do tasks as they should, like a mechanic who doesn’t fix things or an accountant who does not count money. The organizations they take over will be turned into revolutionary groups.
Racist/Discriminatory unless they control it
So with all of these, what will they lead to? Remember the textbook quote above; wokes do not like incrementalism, so they want revolution. The Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 are one of the attempts, perhaps a trial run. They are doing anything to get into power, because that is the only thing that matters for Marxism. Again, to CRT purveyors, everything is racist or discriminatory until they control it.
A Youtube commenter said, “CRT is a big linguistic trick to get good people who oppose racism (in the traditional sense of the word) to, instead, support and/or engage in racism (in the traditional sense) whilst thinking they are still opposing racism.” Webb himself in another article called the idea of institutional racism a conspiracy theory.
Lindsay recounted the Morgan Freeman interview with Mike Wallace where Morgan was asked, how do we stop racism? Just don’t talk about it. Don’t notice my blackness, I won’t notice your whiteness. Because, why would you raise it, are you trying to discriminate? But CRT wants to go the opposite way and will come up with the rationalization that Freeman was only echoing a white ideal. They prefer that things lead to something like the Black Lives Matter riots.
Also, I have written before that “oppressed” people overthrowing and destroying systems will not lead to solutions. The French Revolution happened because of Rosseau’s stupid ideas and it led to a reign of terror. The Chinese Communist Party overthrew the ruling Kuomintang and ruined China. We overthrew Ferdinand Marcos but the problems that beset us then continue to beset us today. Tunisians overthrew President Ben Ali in the famed 2011 Arab Spring series of events, but the same problems remained.
Like the Philippines, neo-leftists had been infiltrating the academe and other areas of life in the US, and even in the UK and Europe. They’ve likely been doing this for a long time, so Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s was no lunatic, he was right. Neo-Marxists have been working their way into mainstream acceptance with silken-tongued claims while hiding who they really are. Also the same in both countries, and perhaps many others, is that this is being struck down as a conspiracy theory or “red-tagging.” We who are aware of this Marxist infiltration of society are struck-down as “right-wing” or “pro-Marcos.” Hopefully, people wise up, become aware of this issue and finally stop what needs to be stopped.
“Debunkers” claim that we Cultural Marxism “conspiracy theorists” believe that Herbert Marcuse, while in the CIA, brainwashed Davis through mind control methods. At least I claim no such thing. Davis was Marcuse’s student, it was just all teaching and Davis embraced the teaching mindfully. All you need is carry on the germ of a bad idea because, no matter who tries it out, it’s a bad idea that will cause a lot of harm (Oh, and speaking of germs, there’s such a paper as “Women’s Studies as a Virus.” See Lindsay’s examination of it).",Politics
Why Is There Less Concern About Vietnamese Illegal Fishing in the West Philippine Sea?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/why-is-there-less-concern-about-vietnamese-illegal-fishing-in-the-west-philippine-sea/,"Mauro Gia Samonte’s opinion article on The Manila Times titled “The Joker in the West Philippine Sea Battle” which demonstrates how Vietnam’s activities in the West Philippine Sea hasn’t received as much attention as those of China’s was an eye-opener for me.
To wit:
“Based on the actual condition in the region, the three major nations having occupancy in the West Philippine Sea are: Philippines, 9 islands; China, 8; and Vietnam, 27 islands, with 49 outposts. Clearly from this record, granting that the Philippines’ claim to the area is valid, all the more reason it must have to protest Vietnamese incursions than Chinese, and yet all throughout the past administration, not even a squeak has been heard against Vietnam; not a single diplomatic protest filed.”
(Note: A statement issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs on June 13, 2022 claims to have filed six protests. See here.”
Further on, he writes
“It should be a good thing that a group of Filipino fishermen has taken pains to sound the alarm over the sighting of Vietnamese fishing vessels poaching in the Katimugan South Reef of the Spratly Islands which is claimed by the Philippines as part of its exclusive economic zone. Pictures were taken of the Vietnamese fishing vessels and one boat “qng37097ts” was clearly identified. According to the fishermen, they have submitted their report and photos of the Vietnamese poachers to the Philippine Coast Guard, hoping that action can be taken. The fishermen aver that the Vietnamese poachers have been frequently observed to use illegal techniques such as dynamite, superlight, compressor and cyanide fishing, resulting in massive damage to the reefs that nurture the fishes. In none of the instances of similar reported Chinese poachers in the WPS has any of the cited illegal fishing techniques been involved. Quantified in terms of damage, the Vietnamese have scored 100 percent and the Chinese none, and yet in terms of propaganda, it has always been a 100 percent China destruction.”
During his visit to New York, President Bongbong Marcos was applauded when he stated our case with regard to our “territorial challenge” with China in the West Philippine Sea.
“As a consequence of this challenge that we have… this diplomatic, this territorial challenge that we have… I would like to point out that this is the first national elections in the Philippines where foreign policy was an issue with the people. Generally speaking, in our experience, foreign policy… the ordinary citizen… the ordinary voter would say ‘well foreign policy is not really our concern, let the experts in government decide that’. But when it happens that our fishermen are not allowed to continue with their livelihood to fish in areas where they have fished for the last thirty, forty generations… Then it becomes an issue right at the gut of our people.”
However, we have yet to see what his statement in New York means in terms of actual orders as Agriculture Secretary or even as the Commander in Chief of our military.
Will we see a significant increase in the number of surveillance and patrol missions by our police, Coast Guard, and Navy in areas where illegal fishing by China or Vietnam is frequently reported?
Perhaps it is still too early to give President any marks at this stage but the 31 million who voted along with those who didn’t vote for him are struggling to put food on the table and what would probably ease the burden for them would be affordably priced fish from our own seas.",Politics
The Mandate of Pinoy Entertainment Is To Protect Baduy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/the-mandate-of-pinoy-entertainment-is-to-protect-baduy/,"Here we go again, pinoy mediocrity is the problem and the powers that be think the solution is more of the same. Jinggoy Estrada made news suggesting he might pursue a ban of Korean shows. Not to be “outdone” Robin Padilla wants a tariff on imported shows.  Why can’t you two accept the fact that Filipino movies and TV year round cater to the baduy and only the baduy? When foreign entertainment get sponsors and ticket sales did it ever occur to you it is because their content is intellectually more appealing than what is churned out locally? Padilla claims people have lost their jobs in the industry. Job loss tends to happen when companies produce products of inferior quality.
I don’t care how many times I have to say it. Whatever you call entertainment be it TV shows, movies, athletics , food the world pretty much skips the Philippines. Whatever their pain threshold for baduy is easily satisfied by a niche in their local market unlike the Philippines where the whole entertainment pie is comprised by baduy and there is no niche for anything that requires braincells. Estrada believes local talent is world class because his family is considered by this country as talented. Somebody forgot to tell the rest of the world. KSP is the root of all evil and apparently the root of all delusion.
Some people see the glass as half empty , some see the glass as half full. Some people saw the first Olympic Gold Medal in 2021 as a cause of great celebration. I saw it as par for the course considering how many countries have more than single digit gold medals in every single Olympics. Hate to break it you but the Philippines cares less about sports than it even does about quality TV. Where else in this country do you see passion for any sport other than basketball? Basketball is the only sport that can draw some semblance of a crowd. I am not the least bit surprised that the one Olympic gold in the history of this nation happened in a woman’s sport since all the men still believe that basketball is the sole path to athletic pansin.
Just so you and I can be on the same page, let’s agree on a working definition of baduy. Baduy is anything or anybody severely lacking in the following traits: wit, reverence, originality, irony, self awareness, nuance, IQ and dignity. Our local TV industry operates on a 3 word mandate : appeal to baduys. The great Colin Cowherd often says ratings are the truth serum. Show me pinoy ratings gold and I doubt you will show me anything that even MENSA can comprehend.
I am not a Korean entertainment fanboy by any stretch of the imagination but there is merit there. I have seen Song Kang-ho in three movies (Memories of a Murder, Parasite and A Taxi Driver) none of them in English. Toss in Oldboy (2003) , Burning ( 2018) and the Netflix hit Squid Games and I guarantee you nothing there will remind you of pinoy TV.
Strength does not need protection. Quality does not need protection. Inferior goods require protection. The market place is reality. The reality is pinoy entertainment is not sought after anywhere in the world and some politicians are proposing that it needs elimination of superior competitors in order to survive. Too bad those politicians will rarely look at jumpstarting the cerebral prowess of the producers of our local content and / or the audience. Oh yeah, I forgot who the dad of one of those politicians is and his contribution to the intellect of the country.
Ironically I want to close this diatribe by citing a locally made forty year old movie. Peque Gallaga’s Oro, Plata, Mata was set in Negros Occidental during World War II. Throughout the whole movie, the threat was always made out to be the invading Japanese. The danger was out there. In reality the only danger was internal. A bitter, entitled  local who could care less about the collective and who was only in it for himself.",Politics
Does a weakening peso mirror weakening economic fundamentals?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/does-a-weakening-peso-mirror-weakening-economic-fundamentals/,"A number of weeks ago, Filipino netizens reacted explosively towards Ilocos Norte Representative Sandro Marcos’s comments regarding the weakening Philippine Peso (PHP) against the US Dollar (USD). Quoting the neophyte congressman, “The peso is weak, not because that it is weak, but because the dollar is strong.”. These words became meme fodder for Filipino netizens, denigrating what they’ve decided is the younger Marcos’s limited intellectual abilities. In hindsight, are these tirades true, or can they be thrown back to these pundits who seem to have no degree of comprehension as to how monetary policy works? Nevertheless, this graduate of London School of Economics definitely knows what he is saying about economic policies and foreign exchange rates.
Monetary policy is an economic policy that is in the hands of the Central Bank. Its key lever one that is used to control of interest rates. These interest rates directly affect the ease of borrowing money, where it would also affect how easy it would be to pay credit card bills and housing mortgages. From a macroeconomic perspective, low interest rates incentivize creation of businesses and generation of employment opportunities. Technically, this is called quantitative easing, where money is virtually created out of thin air through the central bank. On the other hand, high interest rates aid in curbing inflation and is a traditional tool in attempts to control an overheating economy. This would be called quantitative tightening, where money supply becomes more regulated by the central bank.
Central banks all over the world bear responsibility for monitoring and controlling inflation of their respective currencies. Generally, a 2% inflation rate is ideal, where money moves relatively well in an economy that grows under optimal conditions. When the inflation rate go below 0%, the situation is called deflation, where basic commodities become cheaper through time. It sounds tempting to have more affordable items in the market, but deflating currencies discourage consumers from purchasing goods and services, which can lead to unemployment and may hamper economic growth. This can be observed with the Japanese Yen (JPY), where its economy seems to have floundered since the 1990’s. The Bank of Japan continually attempts to intervene through quantitative easing measures, where they increase the supply of JPY in the market by issuing zero or near-zero interest rates, even until now. Despite this, consumer price indices all over the world, which serve to measure inflation, have consistently risen in numerous countries for the past months.
Rising global inflation rates can be attributed to three possible reasons. The first reason would be the massive programs instituted to stimulate the economy during the pandemic, which compelled finance ministries and central banks to engage in quantitative easing measures. This increased money supply were paired with economies that didn’t deliver the promises of productivity, thus spurring up inflation rates. Supply chain bottlenecks, specially for semiconductors and electronic gadgets can be the second reason. With Beijing still applying their Zero-Covid policy, the world’s factory has become more unpredictable, thus raising prices of those products. Finally, the geopolitical conflict in Eastern Europe is also causing inflation because Russia is a significant global energy player as a hydrocarbon exporting country. With Western Europe weaning itself from Russian hydrocarbons, they engage in bidding wars with other countries in the purchase of oil and gas from alternative sources in Qatar, Algeria, and the United States. This auction-like situation in the global hydrocarbon market contributes to these inflation rates.
National governments can generally act on inflation rates by recalibrating fiscal policies that influence the movements of the market. However, this entails tremendous amounts of political maneuvers, consensus-building, and concessions, which can be both time-consuming and politically unpopular. This can be observed when the British pound slumped when then-UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and her then-Chancellor of the Exchequer announced their mini-budget program, which attempted to cut taxes, in the hopes of spurring economic growth. Such counterproductive measures in their fiscal policy witnessed the careers of these two Members of the Parliament flounder, as UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ended up becoming the newest resident of 10 Downing Street.
Recalling how divisive fiscal policies can be in the realm of politics, the Central Banks’ action of raising interest rates seems to be the easiest path. However, they have another power under their sleeves to prop-up the value of their respective currencies, and it is by selling foreign exchange reserves. In the case of the Bank of Japan, which has been hesitant to raise interest rates, they ended up purchasing JPY from the international market by selling a portion of its foreign exchange reserves. This intervention temporarily increased the value of the JPY vis-à-vis the USD. However, a notable currency that had strengthened is the Russian ruble (RUB). Despite international economic sanctions slapped on Russia that greatly devalued its currency for a few weeks, massive interventions by the Bank of Russia were put in place, which generated demand for the Russian currency. These interventions include limiting capital flight from Moscow, and ensuring that purchasing Russian hydrocarbons would utilize the RUB. Notwithstanding its strong currency, Russia’s economic outlook still looks bleak.
America’s Federal Reserve (Fed) has been pretty aggressive in observing the consumer price index of the United States as Chairman Jerome Powell is seeking to hike interest rates, which will further increase demand for USD in the international market. Until US inflation hovers around 5%, the Fed will most likely continue to increase interest rates, and with the USD’s preponderance in global trade, its reverberations will be felt all across the world. With such, the PHP will continue to weaken against the USD, unless the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will incrementally raise interest rates by a few basis points that would not shock the local Philippine economy.
Beyond these turbulent times, the current standing of the Philippine economy seems to be relatively stable. Unemployment rates seem to be manageable, and inflation rates in the Philippines are lower in comparison to other major countries, albeit a little higher from its target of 2%. The country’s solid foreign exchange reserves also serve as a good cushion, which is currently valued at 8-10 months worth of imports, and is even expected to increase further as international remittances to the Philippines are expected to flood the country come December. Needless to say, the Marcos Jr. administration must adopt a conservative fiscal policy by reducing dependency on issuing government bonds, and by continuously investing in areas that will make the Philippine economy more productive in the near future.
Analyzing these observations from other countries, the young congressman from Ilocos Norte does understand his political economy way more than these professional Filipino charlatans, who are only good at sensationalizing content without the necessary contexts. Indeed, ignorance is bliss.",Politics
Will Ombudsman Samuel Martires Face Impeachment For Suspending NIA Administrator Benny Antiporda?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/will-ombudsman-samuel-martires-face-impeachment-for-suspending-nia-administrator-benny-antiporda/,"The question which I used as the title of this blog post arises from documents sent to me by friends from the Marcos administration who are deeply concerned by the six month preventive suspension order issued by Ombudsman Samuel Martires against National Irrigation Administration Chief Benny Antiporda in relation to complaints allegedly made by “officers and members” of the NIA.
Even as I attempt to articulate the questions that have sprung up over the suspension of NIA Chief Antiporda, I have no reason to doubt that Ombudsman Martires issued the order with integrity and full commitment to weeding out corruption in government.
I am especially impressed with Ombudsman Martires’ frank admission that he is battling corruption within his own office.
“I must admit to you, Your Honor — this is not to destroy the Office of the Ombudsman — we ourselves are fighting corruption within the office,” he added.
Source: https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1671139/martires-admits-corruption-exists-within-office-of-ombudsman#ixzz7lAdr2JoC
I can only imagine the kind of mettle one must possess to resist and stand up against the lures of money laden crooks in government who are facing cases at the Office of the Ombudsman.
More power to the likes of Ombudsman Martires!
From Dolomite Beach to Irrigating Philippine Farmlands
Friends and people who follow me on various social media platforms know how I made fun of the Duterte Administration’s dolomite beach which was closely identified with Antiporda.
But whatever I said about it doesn’t go against the fact that I admired the zeal and vigor that possessed Antiporda and others in the Duterte Administration when it came to making sure the people who voted for Tatang Duts would experience his leadership and governance.
Antiporda was then, and according to my sources, still is a firebrand for competent and efficient governance.
I was told by my sources that when President Bongbong Marcos appointed Antiporda to head up the NIA, it was with the knowledge that he would set figuratively set government people’s asses on fire with the objective of delivering on his agency’s mandate.
In the scheme of things, the agency that Antiporda heads is the lynchpin to substantially increasing the productivity of our country’s farmlands with adequate irrigation — which in turn will enable the Marcos administration in making good on the promise of lowering the cost of food.
Yes, the P20 per kilo of rice that might have been a campaign promise not so many months ago!
So there lies my interest in raising issues against the suspension of Antiporda and that is to ensure that the Marcos administration makes good with its promise of feeding its millions of hungry people — myself included.
Suspended Without Receiving A Copy of the Complaint
Usually, when a government official or employee becomes the subject of a complaint, the normal course of due process — as I understand it — dictates that the official or employee is furnished a copy of the complaint and given a period of time to respond to the complaint.
Or in certain cases, a copy of the complaint is furnished together with a suspension order. (Although, in my mind, this probably happens only in cases where the subject of the complaint has committed some manner of despicable crime.)
In Antiporda’s case, however, friends in and around Malacanang tell me that the NIA Chief didn’t even receive a copy of the complaint against him. If I heard it correctly, Antiporda claimed that the only thing he received was the Ombudsman’s preventive suspension order.
With my limited knowledge of the proper legal terminology for this, I would call it so unfair that it borders on persecution — but for what? That’s something I will tackle in the later portions of this article where I juxtapose the complaint against Antiporda and the complaint Antiporda filed against subordinate NIA officials.
The Identity of the Complainant
Before I go into the matter of complaints, one basic and very crucial detail of every complaint is the identity of the complainant. Lawyers are better equipped to explain why this is so, but my simple understanding of this should suffice: If there is anything doubtful or dubious about the complainant, it stands to reason that the rest of the complaint may be doubtful or dubious.
The order issued by Ombudsman Martires dated November 15, 2022 identified the complainants as Officers and Members of the National Irrigation Administration Employees Association of the Philippines (NIAEASP), Lloyd Allain A. Cudal, MIchelle Gonzales Raymundo, National Irrigation Administration Concerned Employee (NIA Concerned Employees).
However, in an official statement issued by the NIA Employees Association of the Philippines and signed by National President Eduardo G. Yu, it says “The National Council of the NIA Employees Association of the Philippines (NIAEASP) categorically disowns and denies any role or participation in the filing of the complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman against NIA Administrator Benny D. Antiporda.”
If the NIAEASP isn’t the one identified as the complainant, then does it stand to reason that the complainant is for a lack of a better word… FAKE?
Moreover, if as NIAEASP president Yu says that their “National Council did not issue any authorization to its chapters and district officers and members all over the country to initiate such action against Administrator Antiporda” then by whose authority was the complaint made?
Was Ombudsman Martires’ Suspension Order The Poisoned Fruit of a Poisoned Tree?
The question now arises, did Ombudsman Martires validate if the NIAEASP officers and members were the ones filing the complaint against NIA Chief Antiporda?
Was there an actual complaint document showing the names and signatures of the so called NIAEASP officers and members?
If Ombudsman Martires didn’t check the veracity of the complainants, how can we then believe the complaints cited as the basis of the suspension order against Antiporda?
Moreover, how then can we trust the justness of Ombudsman Martires’ decision to suspend Antiporda if it proceeds from a “fake” complainant?
Continuing on the same vein, the next question that might be asked… Is this suspension order based on a “fake complainant” against Antiporda a basis for saying that public trust was betrayed in this instance and if so, is Ombudsman Martires courting impeachment?
I will not speculate as to whether it is or isn’t and will wait for our legislators to tackle it in a debate, if ever an impeachment complaint is filed.",Politics
Leni Robredo and Isko Moreno are the same: both are cunning and diabolical political PROSTITUTES,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/leni-robredo-and-isko-moreno-are-the-same-both-are-cunning-and-diabolical-political-prostitutes/,"“Leni Robredo’s narrative is as compelling as that if Isko Moreno,” asserts Professor Randy David in his Inquirer piece today “Reclaiming the power to choose our leaders”. He goes further to elaborate…
The widow of a model public servant who died in a tragic plane crash, she took up her late husband’s crusade for a government dedicated to lifting the lives of the marginalized and ran and won a congressional seat. In 2016, she proved her mettle by accepting a draft to run as vice president even though she was not the first choice. Embodying the defiant Edsa spirit, she won against the Marcos son, and subsequently proved herself as a quiet, competent, and courageous public servant who is not afraid to take on the most challenging assignments. Her appeal is both populist and modern.
I agree with David’s comparing Robredo’s narrative to that of Isko Moreno, but for a different reason. Their narratives are similar because they’re both political prostitutes. Isko’s rise is due to his being both cunning and diabolical. The same can be said of Robredo who hides behind her squeaky clean image of being Ms. Goody Twoshoes. About the most pure is Pacquiao but with purity comes intellectual incapacity for the highest office of the land.
It may well be just a ploy to engineer the outcome of the election by having two Manchurian candidates in Isko Moreno and Leni Robredo. It may be an expensive proposition for the anti-Duterte oligarchs but the stakes are high. A Bongbong Marcos – Rodrigo Duterte ticket winning at the polls would be a wholesale repudiation of the Opposition narrative. The oligarchs would lose control of the government and their wholesale rape of the Filipino people would be stopped because the overwhelming mandate would give the government moral ascendancy. The Opposition has failed in its role as fiscalizer because it has resorted to its old strategy of black propaganda to oust a duly-elected government. They are too lazy to do the hard work that comes with real governance.
The pandemic might just end up as the sideshow to the ultimate showdown which will finally decide the winner in the long-running saga of Marcos versus Aquino. Should the opposition lose, it only has itself to blame.",Politics
Opposition MISTAKEN to think winnability of Duterte camp in 2022 goes down with Bong Go,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/opposition-mistaken-to-think-winnability-of-duterte-camp-in-2022-goes-down-with-bong-go/,"SBG. Senator Bong Go. The presidential aide who was basically chief of staff/executive assistant to the Mayor, Rodrigo Duterte, became the second most powerful man in the country after his principal won the Presidency in 2016. Aides have a long history of being equally or more powerful than their principals because they are the gatekeepers. They control not only the physical traffic flow but also the flow of information. It is a trust and confidence position specially for powerful men or women, such as the President of the Republic. Aides can be the most popular or also the most hated people among the President’s cordon sanitaire. It depends on who is the de facto primus inter pares among the cordon.
In the case of Go, he is with the President and is at his beck and call not only 24/7 but probably 25/8. It’s actually an achievement that Go managed to remain relatively unscathed as the President’s term is about to end. Men like Go are usually the main targets of competitors vying for the sought-after position they hold. The Executive Secretary is the de facto chief of staff of the President but Go is even more powerful than Salvador Medialdea. It isn’t surprising that the two forged an alliance against Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco, who is also close to the President. Evasco was the de facto Davao City Mayor. Duterte isn’t known for spending time in the office attending to the details. He had Evasco for that. As Cabinet Secretary, he was supposed to be the conduit between the President and the Cabinet. Medialdea was to run the Office of the President.
Ironically, it was also the Senators who brought Go upon themselves to become part of the chamber. The investigation into the frigate deal with Hyundai for the Philippine Navy over Go’s marginal note on the document sent to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana caused Go’s appearance before the Blue Ribbon Committee. That fishing expedition led the President to tap Go for a Senatorial run. It could be said that Duterte now had a conduit who would keep him well-informed about what the Senators were up to. Up until last week, there was no sign that Go’s relationship with his colleagues had become untenable.
The Commission on Audit (COA) flagging triggered the latest brouhaha between the Office of the President and the Senate. It can’t be said that there was no malice on the part of the COA considering audit findings aren’t final until a Notice of Disallowance has been issued. Also, the bureaucracy is notorious for non-compliance which triggers the findings to begin with. The anomalies are only confirmed when the agency or department cannot produce the documents justifying the transaction or defending themselves from non-compliance. The instances of corruption in the bureaucracy cannot be denied. It exists despite every President making the promise that it will be minimized if not completely eliminated. The problem is the bureaucracy itself which has gone from bad to worse since the post-Marcos period began. It can be said that everything was controlled when President Ferdinand Marcos was in power — including corruption. The democracy following his ouster also democratized everything — including corruption. This is why it now exists from top to bottom. Not all, of course, but mostly.
When it is the political season, anything goes in Philippine politics. There are Senators who are up for reelection. There are the political orphans who no longer have the backing of the parties they ran under six years ago because it lost the top race. There are the Presidential aspirants who still believe that negative campaigning will work against the incumbent. The recent US Presidential election proved an incumbent can be defeated if the pandemic response is used as an issue against him. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s actually guilty of what he is accused of. It just needs to look that way before the public. Duterte hasn’t been one to adhere to stereotypes. He continues to be popular and isn’t even a lame duck going into his last months in office. The Opposition had to do something. This is that something. It is an old strategy which is typical for them. But they continue to believe it will work in their favor.
It cannot be denied that there is a rift between the father and the daughter, Inday Sara. It does not appear to be contrived as those in the Opposition have openly speculated. Go is caught between a rock and a hard place but he knows where his loyalty lies. It is with the President. The Davao Originals are also reluctant to relinquish power which is why the Go-Duterte tandem came about. As voters, we should all be pragmatic about our politics. We should bear in mind that our politicians are products of a flawed system of government. If this wasn’t the case then we should be up there with Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. But we are not. Our power is only exercised every six years. We should use it wisely and judiciously. All this political theater is just that and nothing more. We should be used to it by now and not be swayed by the usual claims that one side is good while the other is evil. We are at a crucial juncture because of the pandemic. We should be more cunning and devious than our so-called leaders and make it known on May 2022.",Politics
"Filipinos need to put politics aside, work TOGETHER, and ignore Opposition demolition campaigns",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/filipinos-need-to-put-politics-aside-work-together-and-ignore-opposition-demolition-campaigns/,"The administration has again come under fire from the Opposition for its pandemic response. Just when you think they had it down pat, they didn’t. Again. The country was the last in the region to experience a Delta-induced surge and so we’re also leading in the number of daily cases again. The past three days have seen record numbers being tallied. Good that they’re mostly mild or asymptomatic. Bad because the Opposition uses it against the administration. It’s election season obviously.
It doesn’t help that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) can’t seem to make up its mind about how to respond to Delta. They did have enough time to prepare for it. Unfortunately, contingency planning is one of the weaker points of the IATF-EID. To the layman, it sounds simple enough. But try sitting in a meeting where there are at least twenty officials in attendance. You will hear some innovative and some outright stupid ideas being proposed. It’s not a surprise then that the leak about granular lockdowns from Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez was reported by media even if it didn’t have any details.
Then you have the IATF-EID announce a change to general community quarantine (GCQ) for the National Capital Region (NCR) which was met with the usual backlash from the Opposition — they who complain either way when it comes to GCQ or enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), with or without ayuda, preferably with, to make it appear they are “fighting” for those most affected. This is what has the government reeling. The Opposition is forcing it to fight a battle on several fronts at the same time. The passive-aggressive stance of the Opposition is symptomatic of narcissistic personality disorder. I’m not kidding. Read about it and you will see that the symptoms are classic.
There are a lot of factors to consider in granular lockdowns. Truth be told even the subsequent ECQs weren’t as strict as the first one. It’s no surprise then why we are recording an increasing number of new cases. The economy is shot. Inflation is running high. Interest rates are about to go up because the US is also experiencing inflation due to the Democrats’ policies. The US not only has a record budget deficit. It also has record numbers for debt levels and trade deficit. It does not help that after October 8, the political temperature will be going up several notches higher as the cast for the 2022 election is completed.
Government and the private sector should sit down and talk about digitization. Covid is endemic. There’s no use in thinking herd immunity is attainable given the prevalence of the Delta variant. The private sector should spend for the testing of its employees. A vaccine mandate should be issued. Vaccination should be ramped up nationwide. The administration has been focusing on public health and the economy. Education can’t afford to take the backseat anymore. Public educational institutions are seeing record enrolment numbers again and private schools are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. There should be a dialogue between government and private educational institutions. Maybe the government can issue vouchers for private schools to pick up the overflow from state universities and colleges. This will give private schools some breathing room until limited face-to-face classes can be piloted.
The Department of Transportation (DOTr) should also address the issue of mobility. There is no physical distancing enforced in public utility vehicles (PUVs). Jeepneys should not be allowed to ply their routes anymore. The drivers can be retrained to become delivery riders for which demand is still high. There should be route rationalization so that feeder routes to the light rail system can be organized on an intermodal point-to-point basis. Once MRT-7 is operational, the Edsa bus carousel should be scrapped. Definitely the NCR transport system should be designed in a manner that conforms with the observance of minimum health protocols.
There are a million and one details which government needs to address. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats aren’t capable of outside-the-box thinking. It doesn’t help also that other sectoral representatives go out and leak videos of the IATF-EID meetings when discussions become heated. All this is in aid of politicking for the Opposition. This kind of behavior shouldn’t be tolerated. We can’t call on media to be responsible because they are on the side of the Opposition and will do whatever it takes to get the public to turn against the administration. The success of granular lockdowns is on the local government units (LGUs). Unfortunately, the LGUs have shown that they aren’t good for much either. The NCR mayors couldn’t even adopt a uniform contact-tracing system. There is no digital vaccination card. What they give you is a piece of printed cardboard. This also holds true for national government departments which are part of the pandemic response under the IATF-EID.
The Opposition would like to blame this all on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte but they conveniently forget it was they who were in power before. So this is on them. Covid will not go away should Vice President Leni Robredo become the President through whatever means. The pandemic response will not get any better because you can’t build hospitals in thirty days. The same is true with the government bureaucracy. The Opposition can’t even come up with stop-gap measures. They’re only good for PR stunts to make it appear they’re doing something that works. If that were the case, then why isn’t it being adopted by the LGUs?
It’s time to put our critical thinking caps on because the Opposition is preying on the public with its victim mentality approach. We should show them that this and their other traditional demolition methods, don’t work anymore.",Politics
"On shaky ground: Traditional Opposition led by inexperienced Isko Moreno, Leni Robredo bumped off but still hungry for power",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/on-shaky-ground-traditional-opposition-led-by-inexperienced-isko-moreno-leni-robredo-bumped-off-but-still-hungry-for-power/,"Harry Roque’s former law partner Joel Ruiz Butuyan posts a want ad for the opposition in his Inquirer piece “Wanted: An opposition coalition”. A “coalition” he says.
For the opposition to get us out of the black hole the current administration has brought the country into, it needs all hands on deck. That means all personalities, with unblemished and blemished pasts, must exert every effort to come together under the common objective.
Today is August 16. Barely a month and a half left before the filing of certificates of candidacy for May 2022 election. Butuyan describes the Duterte administration as a political black hole which thrives on intimidation and fear. He would like his readers to believe we are in a tyrannical authoritarian dictatorship. What is ironic is he doesn’t seem to see the writing on the proverbial political party wall. There is an opposition coalition but it’s not focused on Leni Robredo. For all intents and purposes, Isko Moreno is the opposition’s standard-bearer. This had been tipped off to us at GRP but we couldn’t come out with it because we don’t burn our sources and he would’ve been easily identified as the source.
It remains to be seen if Isko will get his wish that Grace Poe will be his running mate. But for all intents and purposes, taking into account the recent statements of the 1Samabayan convenors, Yelorme is it. Isko also has the support of the Reds by way of his stint at the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) where he was influenced by Judy Taguiwalo and Noel Leyco. But what are his chances given his glass ceiling is low? Isko is in the top five in the Presidential surveys but, at this point, high numbers are actually a disadvantage in his case. His weaknesses will only start showing in the debates and there is also the issue if being identified with the Yellows and Reds. Aksyon Demokratiko isn’t exactly the ideal vehicle but there isn’t much of a choice anymore since all the others have decided to align with the administration and the Liberal Party is all but dead.
Isko also faces the challenge posed by the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) – Reporma coalition which actually presents the strongest challenge to the administration in terms of experience and machinery. Aksyon Demokratiko also met with NPC-Reporma but obviously the groundwork had been laid for Isko’s transfer which rendered the discussions moot. Lito Banayo is their campaign manager. For sure he will come up with the packaging needed by their slate but Isko’s number one weakness is experience. He hasn’t been in public service that long and hasn’t won a national post. The voters will see through this when the campaign goes into high gear. The debates will have the most impact on the public because that’s when the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates will be on full display. Imagine how Isko will fare when up against Ping Lacson, Sara Duterte and Bongbong Marcos (BBM), should there be a split in the administration coalition. Can he hold his own against these more experienced public officials? Harvard and Oxford leadership courses look good on paper but what counts the most is actual experience which is a working knowledge of government bureaucracy.
There is also the added risk of the opposition being split as well if Robredo forces the issue and runs for President. She will take votes away from Isko specifically. But who knows? Anything is still possible with the fluid political environment. At present, Lacson and running mate Tito Sotto present the voters with the better alternative to the opposition. Aksyon Demokratiko was only formed in 2004. The NPC has been in existence since 1992. Reporma was also organized in 2004 but it counts on the support of retired Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officers and enlisted men among its ranks. That is a solid voting base considering Lacson has done much to advance the cause of AFP soldiers and that of other government uniformed personnel such as those serving in the Coast Guard, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). Isko has much ground to cover after he finally declares his candidacy if he wants to become a serious contender. But he may still fall short despite his efforts because he is simply too green for the job.",Politics
Parallels with 1986? Traditional Opposition cling to Leni Robredo as their hope for “unification”!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/parallels-with-1986-traditional-opposition-cling-to-leni-robredo-as-their-hope-for-unification/,"Evidently caught up in the past, John Nery waxes nostalgic in his Inquirer piece “The united opposition of … 1986”. Nery points out that the fragmented Opposition of that time managed to rally together at the eleventh hour to beat their bogeyman, then President Ferdinand Marcos. He writes wistfully, suggesting that his comrades must see parallels between the challenge the Opposition face today and their magical climactic unification of yore…
But on Feb. 7, 1986, the Marcosian date Marcos himself chose as the day of decision, many of the opposition forces learned to focus on the do-or-die election, and rallied around one standard. By stepping forward, Cory [Aquino] not only made the difference; she made the difference possible.
Indeed it is true that the Opposition then was more fragmented compared to today. Any anti-Marcos rally would be composed of ten or more groups. Monching Mitra was close to both Danding Cojuangco and Ninoy Aquino. That was because they were more than political or friendly acquaintances. They shared a passion for politics, wine and women. Mitra was different because he didn’t have the same warlord tendencies that Ninoy and Danding had. The latter two didn’t disdain violence. It was a necessary tool during those times as evidenced by the regional political warlords.
The United Opposition only came to fruition after Doy Laurel was persuaded to step aside in favor of Cory but not before a deal was made. Cory promptly reneged on the deal after she was installed as President by declaring a revolutionary government. Mitra remained loyal to Cory on paper but this was for the sake of political expediency. Mitra led the welcoming committee when Danding suddenly returned from his US exile in November 1989.
Nery is clearly hoping that history will repeat itself for Leni Robredo. But the circumstances are different now. The Opposition is deluding themselves with their construct that President Rodrigo Duterte is another Marcos and Leni is Cory redux. This is why we are now seeing the various groups which are “clamoring” for Robredo to run. If they take the time to read the writing on the wall, they’ll find that Robredo is not even in the running, much less the central personality of the Opposition that Cory eventually became.
Duterte just put a padlock on the Vice-Presidential race today with the PDP-Laban press release that he has accepted the nomination to run for Vice-President. It remains to be seen if he is serious or not given his record with dilly-dallying until the last minute. But if he’s serious, this may mean Inday Sara “Daughterte” is not running and opens up the possibility of a Bongbong Marcos – Rodrigo Duterte ticket which would be formidable. Already we have the asinine political analysts of the Opposition such as Richard Javad Heydarian weighing in with their half-a-centavo brain being forced to produce a one-centavo output that is actually illogical even to the average Filipino.
Simply put, Duterte is playing a game of Go which has his opponents baffled. The Opposition see the election as an opportunity but Duterte sees it as continuity given the present crisis wrought by the pandemic. In 2016, one of the reasons he cited for running was he couldn’t bear seeing the Philippines being subject to an American President which is an obvious reference to Grace Poe’s citizenship issue. There was also the Yellowidiots’ 18-year plan; six years of Aquino, six years of Mar Roxas and more than likely, six years of Franklin Drilon. They were confident of pulling this off until Duterte entered the picture and ruined everything.
Now it appears the President is bent on doing the same thing again. He is defining the field of battle by his rules. The only thing sure at this point is it will be an exciting last four months of 2021. For all we know, the election may be decided before or by the end of this year.",Politics
"Lacson-Sotto tandem bares pro-Filipino platform of continuity and reform, promises a no-pork-barrel admin",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/lacson-sotto-tandem-bares-pro-filipino-platform-of-continuity-and-reform-promises-a-no-pork-barrel-admin/,"“Nabasa na kami hanggang tuhod. Wala ng atrasan to.” With this statement, Sen. Ping Lacson declared that there would be no turning back in his candidacy, and that of Senate President Tito Sotto, for President and Vice-President in the May 2022 election. Interviewed on HeadStart on ANC, the Lacson-Sotto tandem revealed that unification talks with Vice-President Leni Robredo failed because she wasn’t amenable to the formula Lacson proposed. Lacson was not at liberty to disclose the details of the proposal as there was a prior agreement on confidentiality. He did say though that Robredo was still open to the possibility of her running when they met. The two aren’t conscious of their standing in the various surveys which have come out because they are the only one who have formally declared their candidacies for the two highest posts in the land. They are confident that their numbers will change once the other candidates have made their intentions known, which is when public sentiment would be on more solid ground. The two downplayed the age factor, saying that while they may be septuagenarians, there is no substitute for their wisdom, experience and track record with a combined eighty years total of service to the Filipino people. Lacson downplayed the comments made by his and Sotto’s detractors, saying he will not stoop to their level. It is up to the public to decide, Lacson said. Reacting to the claim that they are “enablers” of the President as made out by former Sen. Antonio Trillanes, Lacson said that he gives praise when and where it is due and criticizes when it is needed. Sotto added further that they are not pro-opposition or administration but simply, pro-Filipino. The focus on KKK, Kakahayan, Karanasan at Katapangan, is their campaign slogan and this best typifies the kind of leadership and service they will render to the Filipino people if elected in 2022. Lacson bared that their complete platform is still in the process of being finalized but he gave an idea about their stand on hot-button issues such as the economy, the drug war and the South China Sea dispute with China. Lacson isn’t in favor of new taxes as he believes the Filipino is taxed out. He is pushing for budget reform and the minimization of corruption in the government bureaucracy as the lynchpin of his economic recovery strategy, in addition to the other measures which have already been passed at the initiative of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Lacson believes these are good laws which the government should implement properly. Sen. Lacson maintained his no-concession stand on the issue of the pork barrel, particularly lump-sum budget insertions parked in different government agencies and departments. Lacson said he will push for the efficient and productive use of the national budget to accelerate regional development. He hopes to pass his landmark Budget Reform for Village Empowerment (BRAVE) Bill before the end of regular session of Congress next year. He also declared a hands-off policy on business, saying that government regulators enforce the law strictly because corruption was behind it. Violators will be prosecuted, he stressed but he will ensure that there will be no coercion or persecution on the part of bureaucrats who are looking for a payoff. On the drug war, Lacson and Sotto were in agreement that it would continue under their watch but with the adoption of a more holistic approach which includes prevention and rehabilitation of drug dependents. Sotto is still for the imposition of the death penalty for convicted high-level drug lords. On the South China Sea dispute, Lacson is not comfortable with the present level of closeness the country has with China. He is in favor of warm ties between the two countries but on the same level of reciprocity. Sotto, for his part, said he would push for the enactment of the long-delayed baselines law, which defines the territory of the Republic as per the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. He is also for the joint-exploration of oil and gas resources, not only with China, but with other countries which also has the technology because of the looming decline in production from the Malampaya platform, which supplies majority of the energy requirements of the Luzon grid. By far the most interesting revelation was the fact that the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) and Reporma, to which the two belong, have not finalized a deal with Aksyon Demokratiko, which they met with last week. Aksyon was represented by its Executive Vice-President Vico Sotto. The meeting was brokered by Malabon City Mayor Lenlen Oreta. This comes on the heels of the reports today that Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso is set to join Aksyon Demokratiko. It would appear now that the Manila City Mayor is running for President. His rumored campaign manager is former Manila Economic and Cultural Affairs chief, Angelito Banayo. The latter bade regular readers of his column in the Manila Standard goodbye yesterday. Lacson also met with the camp of Domagoso but the talks fizzled out because the Manila Mayor insisted that he be the Presidential candidate of the ticket. At this point, it appears that we will have a three-way race for President and Vice-President in 2022. A fourth may be in the offing if Vice-President Robredo throws her hat in the race. What is evident now is, it is the Lacson-Sotto tandem which has the most experience in government and the capability to start functioning in their respective roles if fate smiles upon them on May 2022.",Politics
Isko Moreno and Manny Pacquiao still have lots to learn about what it takes to be President,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/isko-moreno-and-manny-pacquiao-still-have-lots-to-learn-about-what-it-takes-to-be-president/,"Sources confirm that Senator Manny “Pac-man” Pacquiao and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno met as early as last year but couldn’t agree on who would run as President. Isko wouldn’t give in to Senator Ping Lacson, so it is safe to say that it was the same for Pac-Man. One has to be pragmatic when making any kind of assessment. In any case, the venerable national artist for literature F. Sionil Jose, for his part, endorses a Pacquiao-Moreno tandem for 2022 and beyond. In his PhilSTAR piece “Manny Pacquiao, Isko Moreno for 2022”, Jose writes his third column addressed to the Pac-Man. Despite admitting to not being a fan, Jose nonetheless shares his “instict” that tells him Pacquiao is “sincere” and wants to “do good via politics” and issues a call to action to the champ…
Manny, you are comparatively very young and at the height of your creative years. You can create that Workers’ Party now; convert the Party you’ll join, or already have, into a Workers’ Party that will work the whole year and not just election time. The INC and the Soka Gakkai of Japan are your organizational models, but the Party should be non-communist and non-religious.
Jose is a nonagenarian who has lived through all of the Presidents since Quezon. He managed to interview Aguinaldo which gave him insights into what the latter’s mindset was. Aguinaldo was the least-educated among Philippine Presidents. Both Pac-Man and Isko would also fall into this category. What Jose is advocating is the formation of a legitimate political party which the two can use as their vehicle to form a true party of the masang Pilipino. The problem, though, is still the sincerity and the ability to turn ideas into reality. Isko has done well in terms of social amelioration and instilling a sense of order in Manila but he is nowhere near half of his goals as he finishes his first term. Pacquiao hasn’t introduced landmark legislation either as a Congressman or Senator. This is attributable directly to him because he hires his own staff. Ronald Munsayac is incapable of functioning as his Chief of Staff. Between the two, Isko has a better decision-making process and is more independent.
Both have fallen from their initial ranking in pre-election surveys. Isko is now number 5 while Pac-Man is number 8 in Presidential preference. Both drops have been precipitous because of the shaky foundations of their political careers as they don’t have a base to begin with except their career origins; Isko in showbiz and Pac-Man as a boxer up to the present. This isn’t enough to build on for a Presidential run. Both should heed the advice of Jose and build their political stock now. Pinoys love to gravitate towards fads. The strategy for Isko was to gain exposure through social media. This was largely successful. The packaging was as a young, decisive and compassionate leader. Successful as well. But he fell short in the gravitas criteria. Duterte was a Mayor for 23 years. He had established relationships with national politicians and has the intellect even if he packages himself as the dumb promdi. This should be on the top of the list of both if they are to heed Jose’s advice.
Pac-Man should take a page from the careers of the Lacson-Sotto tandem. Lacson is a product of the public school system. He didn’t have access to private education. Even his post-graduate education was obtained at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Yet Lacson has shown his ability to grow into any government post given him; he excelled in his career with the Philippine Constabulary and then as Senator, where he judiciously scrutinizes the national budget for pork barrel insertions. Sotto does not even have a post-graduate degree. Nor is he a lawyer. But he has been an assiduous student of parliamentary procedure and consensus-building. This is the path he charted for himself to become Senate President. Isko should have taken the opportunity to be mentored by Lacson if he agreed to be his running mate. But maybe it wasn’t meant to be as Sotto is definitely more qualified and brings more to the table as Vice-President should they be victorious. This is the path that Pac-Man should be looking at so it would be best for him to run for reelection instead of wasting money on a Presidential campaign with no clear path to victory.
Becoming President is determined not only by fate and destiny but also by preparation. Pac-Man and Isko should heed the advice of Jose. Their time will come in the future when they are better prepared for the challenges of leadership. For now, it’s best to leave it in the hands of those who have put in the effort to get to where they are now.",Politics
"Platforms, a focus on issues, and continuity with reform initiatives are critical input into the 2022 election conversation",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/platforms-a-focus-on-issues-and-continuity-with-reform-initiatives-are-critical-input-into-the-2022-election-conversation/,"Manila Standard columnist Lito Banayo thinks that an amendment of the Constitution solves the problem of political turncoats. In his piece “The short shelf life of Philippine political parties”, Banayo expresses his hope that “the next president will see it fit to initiate revision of the 1987 Constitution and end this insanity of a multi-party system in presidential form.”
I don’t agree.
We’ve seen what happened with the Nacionalista and Liberal parties in the past and those which were organized for the 1992 election. Only the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) survives with a relative measure of clout because founder Danding Cojuangco deemed it necessary to provide financing every election cycle. But Boss Danding is gone. It does not look like San Miguel CEO Ramon S. Ang (RSA) is interested in the NPC because his financial resources aren’t as deep as the original patron. Other parties represent business interests such as the National Unity Party (NUP) which is identified with Ricky Razon. The same is true with the Manila Standard which Razon bought from Andres Soriano III’s Anscor group. The other parties are only hollow shells like corporate holding entities. Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) has only one member, Sonny Angara. It was different from the time of Edong because there was money coming in from his firm Angara Abello Concepcion Regala & Cruz (ACCRALAW). Lakas–CMD, a.k.a. Lakas, is no longer former President Fidel Ramos’s (FVR’s). It is now under former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) and Martin Romualdez.
The long-term solution is a federal parliamentary system which will have regional parties to which the constituents can identify with and actively participate in its affairs. Political parties are expensive to maintain. I recall back in the 90s as a volunteer from NPC how much monies we moved physically from Manila to the regions. Regional political kingpins got the largest share. After that came the Governors and the Mayors. This does not ensure their loyalty either. Those who remain identify more with the patron rather than the party. There was a mass migration to Lakas after FVR won in 1992. In Laguna, only one Mayor was left in the NPC fold. Danding’s strategy was to establish bases in vote-rich provinces where he also had business interests. Negros Occidental, Rizal, Pangasinan and Tarlac were the bailiwicks of the NPC. It remains to be seen what will happen under Tito Sotto’s watch as he is now the most senior member of NPC.
Federalism has been on the table since the time of former President Cory Aquino. Its original proponents were Reuben Canoy and Nene Pimentel. It’s time that it be seriously-considered given how the pandemic exposed the wide development gap between the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+) and the other regions. The Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) put the economy into a recession because 40% of economic activities were in NCR+ including the logistics hubs. Aside from Manila, the only ports through which flow direct shipments of goods for export are the private wharves of Del Monte and Dole in Mindanao. For imports it is only the Ports of Cebu and Davao that can be considered to be significant other hubs.
The pandemic will not end anytime soon. This is why the 2022 election is crucial to the country. We need a President who has the political will to institutionalize reforms for the future of the country. We cannot survive under the old system. Platforms are very crucial. Not only at the national level but at the local government unit (LGU) levels as well. Recovery requires a whole-of-nation approach. Singapore is now working on the basis that the pandemic is endemic. We should too. A federal parliamentary system will provide consistency and continuity. Most importantly, it will allow public participation in governance. Our food security issues can be addressed by the development of Mindanao. This is now possible with peace in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BAR). Energy security is another compelling issue what with the looming power shortage again because the Malampaya gas reserves are about to run out and the life of coal power plants nearing their EUL period. Instead of renewables, nuclear is the best option.
There is a lot at stake on May 2022. We need candidates who have clear plans of action not the usual motherhood statements and campaign promises. Our survival depends on them and for once, it should finally be about issues, not personalities who are merely popular.",Politics
Those idiots who compare Isko Moreno to Inday Sara Duterte just because both are mayors,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/those-idiots-who-compare-isko-moreno-to-inday-sara-duterte-just-because-both-are-mayors/,"It was inevitable that Javad comes up with this comparison given the most recent surveys having the Manila Mayor in the number two slot after the Davao City Mayor. In his Inquirer piece “Isko vs Sara: The battle of mayors”, Richard Javad Heydarian can only write this much about the subject of what is evidently a fluff piece…
What makes Isko a compelling candidate is not only his truly humble beginnings in the slums of Manila, making him a natural champion of the “masa,” but also his sheer will to constantly improve his vocabulary of politics and learn from best practices across the world.
Javad’s comparison fails because Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is just about to complete his first term while Davao City Mayor Inday Sara “Daughterte” has been in office as Vice-Mayor or Mayor since 2007. Isko was a Councilor or Vice-Mayor then. It is but natural to compare the two. Daughterte is a lawyer. Isko managed to complete his education when he transitioned to politics from showbiz. As Javad notes, Isko tends to be performative while Sara, for her part, is mostly stoic. The latter has charm and charisma but is not in the news cycle 24/7 or 25/8, as Isko is on social media. If you believe the Chief Political Analyst that is Antonio Contreras, Isko’s voter base trumps Daughterte. But that is as per their survey. Javad mentions the midde-of-the-road chasm that is developing among partisan diehards. This has been noted in the Pahayag surveys of Publicus Asia. This growing base of persuadable voters, as they are referred to, could influence the outcome of the election but only if there is a candidate who makes a compelling argument for his case. This would be equivalent to the same or even greater disruption caused by Duterte when he ran in 2016.
The recent actions of Isko exposes his weaknesses. He takes a potshot at Daughterte by way of a blind item which is how it’s done in showbiz. The next thing you know, he is at Clark International Airport in Pampanga for its inauguration where his presence was acknowledged by no less than the President himself. It’s no secret that President Rodrigo Duterte has an elephant’s memory when it comes to those who have slighted him, one way or another. Witness how the Estrada-Ejercitos were shut out in 2019. The President praised JV. Daughterte was present at the launch of Erap’s campaign in Manila. But Isko had the Palace’s backing in the Manila Mayoralty race which he won.
If Isko throws his hat in the ring, he’ll be encountering difficulties. First is a political party which will serve as his flag of convenience. Next is a running mate. Then it is campaign financing. While he can count on the support of anti-Duterte oligarchs, his indecision has left these oligarchs looking at the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem, which admittedly, has better chances going up against the administration with the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) machinery and the alliances it has forged with regional political kingpins such as Chavit Singson.
Isko is largely incapable of duplicating Duterte’s feat in 2016. While he is popular, he is dispossessed of gravitas, which the Lacson-Sotto tandem has in terms of track record and experience. Daughterte also has gravitas with her ouster of then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez from his post after a rift developed between them due to certain statements which were perceived as a threat to the President. Daughterte also has communication lines open with both the Marcos camp and former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA). Arroyo has done the rounds of the country during the 2019 campaign and has a picture of what she needs to do in order to win.
Then there is the X factor that is current Vice President Leni Robredo. If Robredo runs, the opposition vote will be split three-ways; Robredo, Lacson and Isko, not necessarily in that order because among the three, Lacson is senior not only in age but experience. Robredo’s quiere, quiere para jele attitude when it comes to making a decision about running or not is also working against her. The same is true with Isko. If and when Lacson-Sotto makes their announcement on August 5, they’re sure to pick up a numbers bump because the public will now look at them as serious contenders. There were reports of exploratory talks between Isko and Lacson but this fizzled out because of Isko’s standing pat on being the Presidential candidate.
While Isko has a compelling narrative to sell, he doesn’t have a voter base he can call his own except Manila. Lacson is a native son of Cavite. Cavite is the most vote-rich province in the country. Region 4-A or Calabarzon is third among voter population on a regional basis. Isko’s being identified as the Opposition’s, read Yellow, candidate is the kiss of death. Lacson-Sotto being in the center has the better path to victory with a compelling and disruptive platform. Sorry Javad but all the smart quotes in your piece don’t amount to anything when up against the political realities on the ground.",Politics
The Opposition’s futile milking of Noynoy Aquino’s death will destroy rather than build coalitions,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-oppositions-futile-milking-of-noynoy-aquinos-death-will-destroy-rather-than-build-coalitions/,"I keep wondering about which planet Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) is on. It’s definitely not earth given the analysis he lays out in his piece “‘Obosen’”. First, what administration coalition is he talking about during the Aquino administration? According to MLQ3, “it was the breakup of the former president’s coalition that allowed a minority take over of the country”. That coalition he is referring to actually broke up when former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) broke with former President Cory Aquino and the late Jaime Cardinal Sin in the mid-2000s. The deal was she was only to serve the unexpired portion of the ousted former President Jospeph “Erap” Estrada’s term. She welshed on that. This was when the destabilization plots against her fluorished at the instigation of her former coalition partners. It didn’t help that her First Gentleman provided fuel for that fire. By the time 2010 was rolling around, Manny Villar was ready with his new acquisition; the Nacionalista Party including the Laurel ancestral mansion on the street which bears Doy’s father’s name. Villar was Lakas before he became Nacionalista. Jojo Binay was opposed to GMA but he wasn’t with the Liberals. He was with the late Fernando Poe Jr FPJ in 2004. Binay ran as Erap’s VP and won. It wasn’t until Aquino won that the Liberals became the ruling party.
The Opposition was supposed to be united under Binay but that fell through because of the demolition job on Binay done by Senators Koko Pimentel, Alan Peter Cayetano and Antonio Trillanes. Binay formed the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) as his political party after his expulsion from PDP-Laban. Going into 2016, it was common knowledge that it would be Mar Roxas’s turn to run seeing as how he revived his father’s old party with his mother’s money. Grace Poe ran under the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) and found additional support from the leftist-militant groups. There was no administration coalition candidate in 2016 as Quezon claims. The truth was, Poe played hardball and Roxas was not to be denied a second time even if his numbers were low. It is precisely for this reason that he didn’t run for Senator in 2013. It was better for him to organize his campaign network as Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary instead of the Senate where he could find a safe haven again if he lost in 2016. We are familiar with what happened next.
As for PDP-Laban and PNoy’s untimely or timely passing, depending on how you look at it, Koko Pimentel wants control back which is why he rammed through Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao’s designation as Acting President. This led Bebot Alvarez to resign as Secretary-General and go back to Reporma. President Rodrigo Duterte, as PDP-Laban Chairman and titular head, wasn’t consulted but, still, he did not object. It’s only now with Koko putting words in Pacquiao’s mouth that the President finally made his mind known. Put up or shut-up. A break in PDP-Laban is what Koko wants to split the administration coalition. But the problem now is, will the Liberals be willing to take in Pac-Man and Koko? There’s a total of three of them if you include Ronald Munsayac. Before Duterte ran, PDP-Laban was a two-man party of Pimentel peré et fil. It does not really matter which party the President employs as the vehicle for 2022. It can be Lakas. It can be Nacionalista.
Nonetheless, here is MLQ3 trapped in his own fantasy…
For the ruling coalition, they were girding for battle thinking there would remain, in lonely internal exile in Times Street, a convenient straw man to rhetorically prop up and then knock down, in order to score easy political points with their followers. The administration coalition was in the middle of the more urgent process of candidate control through cannibalism (rigging a fight in the PDP-Laban where he could be TKO’d and carried away in a stretcher, with lawsuits to ensure political euthanasia), when the former president inconveniently died. The parable of the prodigal son played out over three days, a nation that had viewed him with disdain taking its dead son into its arms one last time; and all the ruling coalition could do was insinuate that the former president died of neglect: as if diabetes, and kidney problems, aren’t such familiar curses many instinctively understood what the man went through.
What MLQ3 doesn’t say is Koko has been their agent all along. Pimentel is more Yellow than Duterte Red. Splitting the Visayas-Mindanao vote works to their favor. Eminent political strategist Malou Tiquia has written about the growing middle, or that divide between the pro-Admin and pro-Opposition partisan communities whose numbers have been dropping. These are what she terms as “persuadable” voters. They can play a role in the election since, if the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem pushes through, there would be an alternative to the law-and-order platform of the President. The macho tandem could package themselves as a better version of Tapang at Malasakit. Think of it this way, would the Liberals seriously consider a Leni Robredo- Manny Pacquiao ticket? Or a Pacman-Robredo ticket? Trillanes was fulminating the the other day about this. As far as he’s concerned, it’s a Robredo-Trillanes tandem or bust.
The Yellowidiots can milk PNoy’s death dry until May 2022 if they want. They will gain some votes but not enough to put them back in the game. As far as the administration is concerned, would Duterte and GMA actually be stupid not to realize that a split does not work in their favor? The Liberals aren’t exactly awash with cash. Judy Araneta-Roxas’s checkbook is closed. She will contribute a token amount but she also has a line to former Senator Bongbong Marcos (BBM). This has been there even when Gerry Roxas was still alive. MLQ3 should get all of his ducks in a row before his next analytical piece. There are two traditional periods of political realignment. One before the deadline for the filing of certificates of candidacy and one two weeks before election day. At this point, the die has not been cast.",Politics
The @1Sambayan June 12 fiasco was a validation of Duterte and a vindication of Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-1sambayan-june-12-fiasco-was-a-validation-of-duterte-and-a-vindication-of-marcos/,"I was thinking of an epitaph piece for 1Sampayan yesterday after that fiasco of a launch.

Our problem as a nation runs deeper because on one side we have the “good” who claim they mean well even if they don’t. The other side of the equation are the “bad” who are supposedly the ills of society but are actually able to do some good. As a sociologist, David should know better what ails the country. It’s not really that hard to find the root cause. The political system is closely tied in to the socio-economic structure. This was the system of government the Spaniards put in place. A plantation-style theocracy which is why there is a parish in every town. The Americans didn’t bother to improve on these constructs because their immediate priority was subjugation.
The elite had bigger dreams — “Independence”. It was good working for the colonial masters but it was better if power was in their hands. We all know how the story goes. US priorities changed after World War II. Independence was granted but not totally. In effect, the elite became our new masters. The two-party system was nothing more than a political convenience. There was no practical ideology. Politics wasn’t issues-based. It was centered on politicians who were the feudal lords who controlled regional fiefdoms that could deliver the vote, legally and illegally if the need arose.
The infrastructure which was in place pre-war was never rebuilt post-war. The Americans shepherded the Japanese so they would be in their corner and we never got paid for the reparations due. The elites focused on rebuilding what they lost during the war. It was only after Ferdinand Marcos won the Presidency that major infrastructure projects were launched. Marcos had a vision for the country. Unfortunately it was clouded by Imeldific. The Rose of Tacloban, then First Lady Imelda Marcos, wasn’t prepared for her role and suffered a nervous breakdown. But after treatment, she got her head screwed on straight and was prepared for the role of her life.
The opposition during martial law were the elites displaced by Ang Bagong Lipunan. Marcos understood the need for a national identity to unite Filipinos. Thus the myth of Maharlika was born. The problem was the country wasn’t actually independent because the Americans were still lurking in the background. The Philippines still served as their first line of defense in the Pacific. It was also a staging area for any conflict in the region. The US bases played a crucial role in the Vietnam War and the coup in Indonesia which toppled Sukarno.
After Marcos was ousted, “democracy” was restored. Since then, the political dysfunction only got worse. The Yellows (partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) embarked on a cult-building indoctrination campaign and the Yellow Ribbon replaced the flag. Instead of the standard of excellence in government with the best and brightest, the culture of mediocrity was ushered in. The wholesale dismissal of officials who were identified with Marcos was part of the cult-building. None of the long-term development plans were retained. It became build-as-you-go. This is why the national capital region is the mess that it is now. Worst was the brain drain that took place. Most of the talented Filipinos left to work abroad. Government became the haven of the idiot and the indolent.
The Opposition finally reaped what they sowed yesterday, the 12th of June 2021. The 1Sambayan coalition didn’t have any viable candidates to present to the public nor did they have a platform. It was still the same old narrative from the Marcos era about “freedom and democracy”. No sooner after they named their bets that the same began issuing polite statements basically saying we don’t want anything to do with you. Democracy died yesterday because the Opposition committed political suicide. Instead of insults and destablization the Opposition should have focused on taking a fiscalizer role and working with the administration. They don’t have the patience and diligence to put in the hard work which only served to expose their lust for power and the absence of a genuine concern for the welfare of the Filipino people.
This is the vindication of Marcos. I have often wondered why his lineage could only be traced back to his parents. There is nothing to find after them. Marcos was obviously of Chinese descent. Up to today, Marcos remains an enigma. It will be thirty-six years in 2022 since the 1986 “revolution” toppled Marcos. That’s how long the reign of the Yellows lasted. It’s all but a formality now. It is imperative that a new opposition rise. Our more progressive regional neighbors are ahead in their nation-building process. We need to catch up. A genuine opposition would still uphold the best interests of the country first and work with the administration after the election. EDSA and “people power” should be thrown in the trash. It’s about time that we give the Constitution the respect it deserves. For that matter, we should amend or do away with the 1987 Constitution en toto.
The Chinese have said that in crisis, there is opportunity. In the midst of the pandemic where the only certainty is uncertainty exists the opportunity to rebuild and build back better. The Opposition will never admit that there have been gains in the last five years. Duterte didn’t make good on all of his campaign promises but he made good on those which have an immediate impact. The 2022 election is not a referendum on Duterte. It is validation for him and vindication for Marcos. Singapore has a democratic dictatorship. Perhaps what worked for them would also work for us.",Politics
Dumaguete City Government To Sign Joint Venture for 174 Hectare Reclamation Amidst Raging Protests,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/dumaguete-city-government-to-sign-joint-venture-for-174-hectare-reclamation-amidst-raging-protests/,"Dumaguete City Mayor Felipe Antonio B. Remollo is grossly understating the devastation that his pet 174 hectare reclamation project will bring to the people of provinces surrounding the Bohol Sea — also called the Mindanao sea.
This even as today Mayor Remollo and other city officials pushes through with the the contract signing of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for the so-called “Smart City” in the face of citizen-led protests.
Unlike reclamation projects within a bays such as Manila bay where the resulting damage can be naturally contained, the proposed reclamation project juts out into the Bohol Sea where debris as well as all manner of pollution will be carried out and circulated for years.
The project entails years of dumping 17,400,000 cubic meters of soil, sand, and rocks over an area more two and a half the size of the Mall of Asia or four times the size of NAIA.
The resulting disturbance of the seabed in the area is certain to spread debris and pollution over throughout the Bohol Sea which feeds the provinces of Negros, Cebu, Leyte and Bohol as well as provinces in Northern Mindanao Region and Caraga Region.
The impending environmental devastation is further described in detail in a joint statement signed by Silliman University President Dr. Betty McCann together with former SU presidents Dr. Ben S. Malayang III and Dr. Angel Alcala — former DENR Secretary.
The statement reads:
We’re scratching our heads trying vainly to figure out the kind of thinking that led DENR Secretary Roy Cimatu to approve the area clearance for the Dumaguete reclamation project in December 2019.
This is an absolute turnaround from former DENR Secretary Gina Lopez’s widely popular shutdown of all mining operations in the country which saved millions of hectares of forested land.
We’re not sure if this has any bearing on Cimatu’s support for what appears to us an environmentally unsound project that could destroy the Mindanao Sea, but we have come across information that a certain Lem Faustino was seen inspecting the future reclamation site.
We asked around and it seems Ms. Faustino here, apart from going on site inspections in Dumaguete City, will be running for Mayor in Calumpit, Bulacan. For certain, campaign expenses in this season of COVID-19 may be quite steep and one must have the means.
Lem is said to be the sister of Mayumi Faustino who is said to be very, very close to Cimatu. Perhaps coincidentally, the Faustinos own a construction business and it was said that they’re getting a lot of government contracts — though I am not sure if a substantial number came from Dumaguete City.
However, the money that
Somebody will become billionaires out of this. MY ESTIMATES: Project cost: 23 Billion Pesos. Area: 174 hectares or 1,740,000 square meters.
Backfilling Depth: estimated at not less than 10 meters. Estimated required volume of backfilling materials: not less than 17,400,000 cubic meters.
Truckloads needed (carrying cpacity 16 cubic): not less than 1,087,500.
Price per cubic: not less than 500 pesos.
Projected income: 8.7 Billion pesos.
Projected destruction: 174 hectares of seabed and marine sanctuary + 174 hectares of earth materials from our mountains.
THE PROMISE OF PROGRESS AND WORK IS THE BAIT. BUT WHAT IS THE CATCH?
Earnings of those behind the project:
ON TOP OF THE INCOME OF LAND DEVELOPMENT,
Projected Buildable land area: 60% of 174 hectares or 1,740,000 square meters = 1,044,000 square meters; Present market value – 60,000 per square meter.
Total income to be generated – 62,640,000,000 or 62.64 Billion Pesos vs investment of 23 Billion Pesos.
What does our government get in the transactions, only public spaces. No buildable areas.
In the JV agreement, the City is the applicant of the reclamation, but the contractor and those behind it are the owners of the project.
Another curious detail about the Dumaguete reclamation project is the city government’s joint venture partner which is said to be E. M. Cuerpo. It seems the company recently figured in allegations of a rigged bidding in Negros Occidental.
The article reads:
“Provincial Budget Officer Jose Percival Salado has denied allegations of an anomalous public bidding for the construction of the P450-million NEGROS FIRST cyber center amid speculations that the Provincial Capitol is favoring a contractor.
“In December, the Pre-qualification, Bids, and Awards Committee, chaired by Salado, declared the joint venture of the Quezon City-based E. M. Cuerpo Inc and Yanson Dynamic Builders and Construction Company Inc. the winning bidder for its P449,873,520.20 tender.”
Moreover, it was also Cuerpo that faced an investigation by the Clark International Airport after a ceiling it allegedly installed collapsed.
In an article from CNN Philippines, it said:
Clark International Airport Corporation President Jaime Melo on Wednesday said its legal team has started reviewing the contract of E.M. Cuerpo Incorporated, the contractor of the old passenger terminal building, following allegations the airport was constructed using substandard materials.
“We can get back to the contractor if we find that its substandard… We’re checking if its substandard. We’re checking the contracts done six years ago,” he said.
A deeper look into some comments on a number of posts on Facebook allege that E. M. Cuerpo is a front for another Chinese corporation.
They are not making a reclamation that is adjacent to the Dumaguete shoreline.
They are making an island. Meaning you can’t just access it from any of our territorial boundaries . They’ll put bridges. So this owners will have control of the entryways. It is private property after all.
And this EM Cuerpo Development only just recently qualified as a quadruple A contractor.
He is just fronting for Chinese Nationals.
Hay, the insik will be everywhere here. They’ll bring their gambling, drugs, prostitution with them.
We’re up in arms about the West Philippine Sea, Scarborough shoal etc and yet now , there will be an island 30 meters away from our coastline.
Hello New China Territory! What they are not mentioning are the casinos they’ll have there.
The city officials (with exception to Perdices and Arbas) are enticing the Dumaguetenos with promises of jobs yet we all know, basing from what is happening in Metro Manila, these Chinese bring their workforce in from China because labor is cheap and there are no labor laws to speak of from where they came from.
Furthermore, it was said:
POLY CHANGDA is the investor. EM CUERPO is just the developer. Both the mayor and the developer want to get this contract signed. This is the requirement for POLY CHANGDA to release the funds. Poly Changda, also known as the Guangdong Provincial Changda Highway Engineering Co,- a Chinese company.
What the… It’s bad enough that the Chinese have gotten a couple of rocks in the West Philippine Sea, swathes of Pasay City and Paranaque City… NOW THEY’RE GOING TO GET DUMAGUETE CITY TOO?
Is reclamation the only way towards progress?
Nearly ten years ago, I campaigned hard for a reclamation project in Manila bay after seeing how it could alleviate the terrible congestion that we Manilenyos experienced from sun up to sun down.
Manila was choking in overdevelopment and squalor. Sky high residential condominiums and sprawling malls suffocated the open spaces that once used to be playgrounds and promenades even as informal settlement areas were bursting onto the streets.
Getting to and from places within a four kilometer radius took hours on streets filled with smoke, garbage, people, interminably open excavations,  potholes and untreated sewage. That is, if it wasn’t raining because even a ten minute downpour would render all major streets impassable because of chest deep floods.
To most of us  who lived in Manila who welcomed it, reclaiming hundreds of hectares seemed to be the only logical solution to urban congestion.
We figured that Manila Bay was long dead anyway and creating new land from the dead bay would allow us in the city room to breath, that would in turn enable us to rethink the development of the inner city without the duress created by the problems of congestion.
Opposition against the new reclamation project on Manila won and the project was shelved indefinitely.
Today, other solutions to inner city congestion in Manila has come online and this has forced those of us who were for initially for it to rethink our positions — if not, to completely abandon the idea.
The opening of the Skyway Stage 3, the expansion of the MRT lines, and others have vastly shortened commuting times to and from areas farther north and south of Manila. The Balik Probinsiya program that was launched last year as part of the the government COVID-19 response also somewhat had an impact on urban congestion.
All of the above and others that I may have neglected to mention show that there are ways to preserve the environment and cultural heritage even as we rush headlong towards development and progress.",Politics
Answering Bobby Tiglao On Why Pnoy Died Alone,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/answering-bobby-tiglao-on-why-pnoy-died-alone/,"Pnoy died alone.
One of the richest and most powerful men in this country presumably closed his eyes for the last time, breathed his last breath, and slipped into the long silent sleep.
His driver says he did so peacefully.
But perhaps he was only being respectful as servants are expected to be respectful.
How much of it was out of love? How much of it was out of fear? How much of it was simply following some the admonishment we get as kids to be on our best behavior when in public? How much of it was intentionally worded so as not to hurt those closest to him?
It would have been appalling if the driver had said that Pnoy died with his teeth clenched and his eyes wide open, bulging from its sockets just a few steps away from his security detail.
Of the cause of her brother’s death, his sister told the public that Pnoy died from “renal disease secondary to diabetes” which glosses over the details of how one dies when they “skip” dialysis.
Part of me wants to go along with the charade of Pnoy’s peaceful death, but another part of me just can’t abide by polite untruths — though I understand why such are said in public.
You’ll still read common folk’s social media posts about how one or another relative suffered from diabetes, heart disease, and renal failure.
But Pnoy and his family are not the kadiri, vulgar common folk. Never were, never will be. (Though they make a spectacle of showing that they can sometimes do as common folk do in order to be relatable.)
So, you probably won’t hear about how Pnoy suffered from his siblings and relatives.
I personally have witnessed the years of suffering of one who had to undergo years of regular and frequent dialysis. I really can’t say it was peaceful for the most part.
People who lived with that person and took turns caring for him would have good, bad, and awful days depending on what state that person was.
A telling clue to how Pnoy was during his last few days saw its way to publication. It was his caregiver who said that she had asked Pnoy’s guards, “Namuyat ba?”
I wouldn’t be surprised if his caregiver also had a difficult time making sure Pnoy drank just the right amount of water or made sure to measure the volume of his urine. I imagine she would have had to bear bouts of hearing Pnoy complain about being thirsty all the time or insist on eating certain kinds of food he was prohibited from eating.
There would have been all sorts of aches and itches.
Another telling clue was that Pnoy’s caregiver said that she found him in his reclining chair and not in his bed.
Those with serious heart ailments and renal diseases, are said to complain of being unable to sleep lying down their back or on their side.  They were only able to get some sleep while in lying in a reclined position in bed, with their upper torso propped up or elevated above their legs.
It’s pretty much an all you can eat buffet of aches and pains for the one who has to live with regular dialysis. So much so, it can sometimes make them wish out loud for death.
Yesterday, I read Bobby Tiglao’s post asking why none of those nearest and dearest to Pnoy were by his side during his final hours.
It isn’t a mystery and nothing is suspicious about Pnoy being alone in his final hours.
Thing is, his many discomforts might have made him too difficult for those close to him to bear or knowing he might be a burden, he might have chosen to seclude himself to spare others.
Some people choose to suffer alone and it is understandable because seeing your loved ones suffer with you might be too painful.
Not everyone can endure taking care of the critically ill, especially when they argue bitterly with you or get into a terrifying mean fits.
At the end of the day, as Pnoy would presage some kind of profundity, we can only wish to die peacefully holding our loved ones in hour hands…
Farewell Pnoy.",Politics
Manny Pacquiao’s promise to house every homeless Filipino is dishonest and irresponsible,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/manny-pacquiaos-promise-to-house-every-homeless-filipino-is-dishonest-and-irresponsible/,"When you have a Senator who wants to be President on the basis of his popularity, it’s safe to say he will be mouthing populist policies in aid of election. Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao was quoted last week saying that if he is elected President, he will give each and every homeless Filipino a home. That’s a very tall order of a promise given that it is a safe estimate that 50% of Filipinos are without a decent house of the low-cost housing variety.
Housing was one of the priority programs of then First Lady Imelda Marcos in her combined posts as Minister of Human Settlements and Metro Manila Governor. Imelda focused on both in-city housing projects and off-city relocation. She ensured that relocation sites would have access to transportation, water and power. In-city relocation was accomplished by way of the mid-rise condominium developments which are still standing. These were known then as BLISS Housing or Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services. Financing was obtained either through the SSS or the Pag-Ibig fund. The Bliss units were well-designed and constructed as it is evident up to now because they have passed the test of time. Land was still plentiful in Metro Manila during that time. In fact, you could still see carabaos grazing in the vacant lots in Quezon City, near its boundary with Novaliches. It was Imelda who had the Lagro area developed along with Cogeo in eastern Metro Manila for government employees.
Unfortunately, the housing problem is another that was exacerbated by the Yellows. The master development plan for Metro Manila was thrown in the trash can after the Marcoses were ousted. What happened was uncontrolled development which continues up to now. Metro Manila is in the top five most densely-populated metropolitan areas in the world. Every available square meter is being bought up by real estate developers for condominiums development. The housing backlog is such that the nearby provinces of Bulacan, Laguna, and Cavite are also overflowing with residents who work in the National Capital Region (NCR). This is why the province of Rizal is experiencing a construction boom as low-cost housing developers are now building on the eastern border of Metro Manila.
The term low-cost is misleading because the units are not within easy reach of the average Filipino. Pacquiao’s pronouncement shows his lack of policy experience. It is easy to say but hard to do, more so with the government bureaucracy. It’s not only the bureaucracy but the corruption in government housing agencies. Former President Cory Aquino abolished the Ministry of Human Settlements. It has been revived as the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development. Politicos like Pac-Man should stop making irresponsible statements in aid of their planned Presidential bids. Pacquiao means well no doubt but he should also be realistic in his promises. We are now seeing the effects of the politics of revenge which began in 1986.
Current President Rodrigo Duterte extended his offer of unity to the opposition after he won in 2016. The Opposition, rather than work with him, promptly proceeded to begin their efforts to oust him through whatever means. Now the Opposition claims they can do better even if Duterte has proven what he can accomplish in five years. The next President has a huge challenge before him or her. But as voters, we should also be responsible for the choices we make so it is high-time that we separate the chaff from the grain and demand a platform from candidates who are running, with a clear and concise plan of action and not the motherhood statements all of them resort to come election time. If we are to demand maturity from politicians, we should also become mature voters.",Politics
Lito Banayo fluff piece on Robredo reveals possible Isko-Leni tandem for 2022,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/lito-banayo-fluff-piece-on-robredo-reveals-possible-isko-leni-tandem-for-2022/,"Lito Banayo has been a political affairs adviser since before 1986. He began his political career with the later former Vice President (to former President Cory Aquino) Doy Laurel. To my best recollection, the only time he wasn’t given a government post was during the administration of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). Banayo had this uncanny ability to insert himself in the campaign of the candidate who eventually wins the Presidential race. During the Aquino administration he was the National Food Authority (NFA) head. Now he is the de facto Philippine ambassador to Taiwan at the Manila Economic & Cultural Office.
The obvious question is, who will Banayo pick for 2022? Banayo makes for good reading every election cycle because he tips off readers of his column about the inner workings of the powers that be the most crucial of all political races. Why this sudden praise piece, “The lady has grace”, for Vice President Leni Robredo published on the Manila Standard? Banayo writes how Robredo had “showed grace” through the years of tumultuous relationship with her boss, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. He writes further…
What I find quite perplexing is why the President’s spokespersons, de jure as in officially appointed, or de facto, as in self-appointed, find it so easy to disparage every action or statement of the lady, even if first, she is a lady, and second, the words she uses are not at all acerbic compared to theirs.
Banayo hasn’t written much about the VP even in 2015 when she was picked as then Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas’s running mate. He writes about the “disparate middle forces” who support Robredo which is another euphemism for the Yellows. Interestingly, Banayo suggests that this support  base is “not necessarily the so-called ‘dilawans’ to which she has been fairly or unfairly classified by the rabid Duterte die-hards.”
Consider though that the “EDSA Revolution” was largely successful in Metro Manila because of the middle class. The myth of a landslide victory in the Senatorial race of 1987 was proven to be a sham come the Presidential race of 1992. Cory’s anointed only won by a plurality of 23%. That was the race which had the most number of candidates running for President. It was the last attempt for the prominent politicos of the 1960s to take a shot at the highest office in the land.
A source has indicated that Banayo has been picked to run Manila Mayor Isko Moreno’s campaign. This is a surprising development since one would think that he is the logical choice for Senator Ping Lacson should he commit to run for President. It was Banayo who ran Lacson’s 2004 campaign for President. The obvious question now is, is an alliance brewing between Isko and the VP? Or is this just a trial balloon being floated to determine the viability of the tandem? Maybe Grace Poe is reluctant to subject the FPJ brand to another beating if she runs for VP?
At this point, the guessing game is heating up with July just around the corner. Even the President is floating red herrings in the air. He threw in Martin Romualdez in the VP mix yesterday but made it confusing because of his statement that he still has unfinished business. I think the picture will be a bit clearer after the President delivers his last State of the Nation Address (SONA) when Congress reopens in July. We will see politicos who are thinking about running taking advantage of the recess to go around the country to speak to the regional kingpins to get a sense of what kind of support they can expect if they make a commitment to run.

Manny Pacquiao’s possible next move following PDP-Laban brouhaha,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/manny-pacquiaos-possible-next-move-following-pdp-laban-brouhaha/,"The Opposition continues its fixation with the internal wranglings of ruling party PDP-Laban. In case you were asleep the past six months, Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao has been going around the country testing the waters for a Presidential run. Polls have him within the top 10 but not close to the front-runners Inday Sara “Daughterte” Duterte and Bongbong Marcos. Pacquiao was egged on by Senator Koko Pimentel to run after he was made Acting President of PDP-Laban. His early campaign was nipped in the bud after Retired Supreme Court Justice Carpio of 1Sambayan questioned his attendance record in the House before and the Senate at present.
The cracks in the party started showing last year when the name of Bong Go was floated by no less than President Rodrigo Duterte himself. Go reacted by saying he would only run if Duterte ran with him as Vice President. Even this didn’t fly with the “Die-hard Duterte Supporters” (DDS). However, the idea of a Daughterte-Duterte tandem has caught on. The Opposition pounced like a choir chanting “the Philippines is not Davao”; an allusion to the father and daughter switching posts in order to maintain their control of the largest city in the country. The Opposition wants nothing more than another candidate to emerge from the ruling coalition which they believe will split the vote in their favor. This is assuming, however, that they can agree on a candidate. The truth is the Liberal Party is silent because it does not have funding. Mar Roxas and Judy Roxas aren’t opening their chequebook for Leni Robredo. Roxas’ loss in 2019 was the end of his political career. Three consecutive losses as VP in 2010, President in 2016 and Senator in 2019 is similar to the three knockdown rule in boxing.
1Sambayan is probably being bankrolled by Manny Pangilinan. The goal is not to unite the Opposition so a new opposition can emerge from its ashes. Pangilinan is supposedly considering either Manila Mayor Isko Moreno or Senator Grace Poe for President or both to run as a tandem. A disgruntled Pacquiao would be a welcome addition to their fold. The Yellows with their wokeness won’t touch the bible-thumping boxer but Pangilinan can surely use him as a pawn in the Senate but Pac-Man would be committing political suicide if he breaks from Duterte. His political future is still bright as he’s only 43. He can aspire for the highest post in the future since he is the one and only Pambansang Kamao.
Of the more recent situation Pacquiao faces, Boo Chanco writes in his PhilSTAR piece “Duterte KOs Pacquiao?”…
What are his chances of winning? Manny didn’t do too well in recent polls. I expected more from him, given his name recognition. Maybe that will improve when people know he is really running.
Duterte must have seen those numbers too, and was emboldened to knock Manny out very early in the game before he got traction. The Dutertes are determined to hang on to Malacañang.
But Pinoys love underdogs. Manny can paint the Dutertes as big bullies and pick up sympathy votes. However, Manny must have a really good social media team to, at the very least, neutralize the DDS.
It’s interesting though how Chanco is buying into the logic of Inquirer columnist and former Malacanang Communications Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III that the majority still doesn’t support Duterte. The Opposition has been trying to sell this to the public immediately after their loss in 2016. The test was in the 2019 midterm where they lost miserably. What is there to prove? A landslide in 2022? The Yellowidiots still relive the glorious days when they ousted President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2001 despite his winning the Presidency by a landslide. The bad news is those days won’t be repeated any time soon. Pac-Man should toe the party line and follow the party leader. He has reached the apex of his boxing career but still has much to learn about politics. Bear in mind that he lost his first bid for Congress when he went up against the Antoninos of General Santos City. This is why he had to change his residence from South Cotabato to Sarangani. It was there that the finally managed to win. Instead of Koko Pimentel, Pac-Man should listen more to Chavit Singson who can teach him more about the vagaries of Philippine politics.",Politics
Desperate Philippine Opposition weaponises Fatou Bensouda’s International Criminal Court “ruling”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/desperate-philippine-opposition-weaponises-fatou-bensoudas-international-criminal-court-ruling/,"International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s ruling has been weaponized by the Yellowidiots and their allies again. The rub here is they claim they’re patriotic in resisting Chinese agression in the South China Sea on the issue of sovereignty. But when it comes to a cause where they’re desperate, they’re willing to sacrifice sovereignty.
This dishonest sentiment is seen in how Inquirer columnist uses the ICC as primary reference in his piece “Some LGU leaders bloodier than others” where he writes…
From Fatou Bensouda’s request for a deeper probe into the possibility of crimes against humanity in the Philippines, we know the President’s potential co-accused include the top brass of the PNP from July 1, 2016 to March 16, 2019. A document exists that can tell us who, among civilian LGU officials, deserve inclusion as well.
This sort of deference coming from a supposedly respected “thought leader” is no different to the conduct of his ilk during the years following the Aquino assassination when then Rep. Stephen Solarz became the go-to-guy of the opposition in the US Congress. The other issue is the hypocrisy of the Yellowidiots in the way they highlight as an issue only those who they claim were killed on direct orders of the President and are conspicuously silent with regard to the plight of the families of the victims of drug-crazed criminals.
This has always been the Yellowidiot trait. They selectively interpret or even twist the law whenever convenient for them. Witness how the 1973 Constitution was thrown out the window along with Marcos in 1986. They didn’t even bother to respect their own 1987 Constitution when they toppled then President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2001. People Power was again cited back then. For good measure, then Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. came up with the constructive resignation doctrine in a huff in order to ensure the legitimacy of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) as his successor. Of course all of this was justified because they are the forces of good against the forces of evil which was Erap and his midnight cabinet.
Since 1983, the Yellowidiots have relied only on one playbook. It’s now 2021 but former President Ferdinand Marcos still figures prominently in their “cause”. The short of it is the ICC investigation will not prosper. The Yellowidiots are claiming it as a victory for human rights. One thing they never learned is for an issue to be publicly palatable, it should redound to the benefit of the majority and not a few — which is why, up to today and after their electoral defeat in 2016 and 2019, they still have no clue as to why they lost.",Politics
How to win against Duterte?

Strange bedfellows but always intertwined because of the 300 years under Madre España. Most people think Rodrigo Duterte is an atheist but a closer look at his character reveals that he has both mommy and daddy issues, which is why he also has a convoluted relationship with the supreme being. The opposition has always painted him to be a sinner which is hypocritical because all of us are. Truth is Duterte is a narcissist’s narcissist. He is actually an empath who had to suffer the dynamics of being the eldest child of two straight-laced parents whom much was expected but didn’t deliver because of the bad boy image he cultivated in order to survive the challenges he faced while hiding his true persona.
Witness how he always makes references to his mother but not his father. Rodrigo Duterte is a Mama’s boy. That is evident. It was Nanay Soling who put the fear of God in him. Lito Banayo’s column today is reminscent of the writing style of the late great Louie Beltran. His immenseness as another great, Larry Henares, referred to him. In “The beheading” published on the Manila Standard, Banayo writes about how “the transcendental question in everyone’s mind is whether Rodrigo Roa Duterte, by the grace of God and the will of the sovereign people, President of the Republic since noon of June 30, 2016, will agree to run as vice-president come May 2022 to his daughter or his favorite’s presidential quest.” Being transcendental question, Banayo defers to the words of the presidential spokesman Harry Roque for an answer, thus; “If the President thinks it is God’s will, he will make the proper announcement in due course”.
Banayo has been in government since the time of Cory. He’s like a Drilon who hides in the shadows but always manages to insert himself in the inner circle of the winning candidate except for the election of 2004 when he quarterbacked the candidacy of Ping Lacson. From his tone today, it is clear Banayo is making a mockery of the national council meeting of PDP-Laban held in Cebu where Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao got his legs cut off at the knees, ostensibly upon the instructions of the President who sanctioned the party event. This is a sign that a Ping Lacson – Vico Sotto tandem is in the making. Whether or not it comes to a fruition is another story altogether. But why not? Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is green under his gills and has a lot of skeletons in his closet which can be used to torpedo his candidacy the moment he declares. The same was done to Duterte but he nipped it in the bud by owning his skeletons particularly, the dissolution of his marriage to Elizabeth Zimmerman. In Isko’s case, there’s a huge difference between his image before and that which he has adopted since 2019. God first, he intones in each of his speeches.
I’ve said before that a new and credible opposition needs to rise from the ashes of the Yellowidiots who have been burned to a crisp. But Ping-ky is not exactly the ideal Presidential candidate as evidenced by his lackluster performance in 2004. Not even his capitalizing on former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) being the least popular post-Marcos President gave him more votes. Lacson can be backed by the same oligarchs as those who are funding Isko now because he will not bite their hands if he wins. But therein lies the problem. How to win against Duterte? An Inday Sara Duterte – Bongbong Marcos tandem is like Joseph “Erap” Estrada’s run in 1998. No contest. At this point, the only viable strategy for the opposition is a split in the administration power blocs. The problem is Pac-Man is bereft of political gravitas. The masses aren’t convinced that he’s ready for the Presidency. And so we have to wait until probably at the earliest September, or the latest until December 15, which is the deadline for substitution of candidacies. In the meantime, there is the 1Sambayan event on June 12 to look forward to.",Politics
Presidentiables are a no-contest but the race for the vice presidency in 2022 is where it’s at!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/presidentiables-are-a-no-contest-but-the-race-for-the-vice-presidency-in-2022-is-where-its-at/,"The circus is back in town. The political circus that is. Virus or no virus. The situation is different from the last Presidential election cycle. There is not much jockeying for the anointment because there are only few candidates and the outgoing President is not from the “silent majority.” In short, it is not like 2010 when part of the administration became the opposition by virtue of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo GMA breaking with Cory Aquino. That mold was broken in 2016 also because Rodrigo Duterte wasn’t exactly in the opposition. The fact is, he was always neutral, choosing to side with who won the election. Every candidate who came to Davao to campaign was welcome.
Today we are left with not much choices. Those who have ranked in the top five of the latest survey are Davao City Mayor Inday Sara “Daughterte” Duterte, former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, Senator Grace Poe, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, and boxing-champ-turned-Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao. The most senior in terms of experience is Ferdinand Jr. Next is Grace Poe. Then Inday, Isko with Pac-Man bringing up the rear. The son of The Greatest Ilokano should be President but from the looks of it, that is still not within reach even if he is the sentimental favorite. There are quite a number of oligarchs who are wary of a Marcos Presidency. For one, the Marcos matriarch Imeldific is still around and she has a long memory. There are legal issues pending concerning the ownership of top companies which were owned by Marcos cronies as dummies but spirited away in the tumult of the EDSA “Revolution.” No doubt about it, Marcos won the Vice-Presidency in 2016. He was cheated and the facade had to be maintained lest sleeping dogs be awakened. The only way Bongbong becomes President is if fate smiles or even laughs out loud on him.
The others on the list are still deficient in experience. Grace Poe has kept under the radar following her 2016 defeat though she managed to win re-election in 2019. That’s the legacy of her father Fernando Poe Jr’s FPJ brand. Pac-Man is too raw for the Presidency. Senator Koko Pimentel and Ronald Munsayac should give up on their dream of becoming political Svengalis. Pacquiao has masa appeal but only up to the Vice-Presidency. Filipinos aren’t that desperate for him to become President. The Pambansang Kamao was TKOed in the first round of his political boxing match with no less than the President as his indirect opponent. The privilege speech he delivered at the Senate against his perceived tormentor, the Energy Secretary and PDP-Laban Vice-Chair Al Cusi, was more like a boxer blindly punching at his opponent in an effort to score points. Pacquiao should just run for re-election to the Senate.
This brings us to the newest wonder boy of Philippine politics Isko Moreno. Isko has been a survivor all his life. He was able to lift himself out of poverty because of his looks. A lackadaisical acting career made him transition to politics. He learned at the feet of veteran Manila politicians Danny Lacuna and Fred Lim. In 2019, he allied himself with veteran councilors Bernie Ang and Felixberto Espiritu to beat former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada to become mayor of Manila. It helped that he had the financial backing of International Container Terminal Services Inc (ICTSI) chair Enrique Razon. Erap’s tactical mistake was the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) islands in Manila Bay which was going to fund his retirement. That was where Razon drew the line. ICTSI is headquartered in Manila and is one of its top taxpayers. Isko has a genuine heart for the poor but he hasn’t been able to gain much headway in City Hall against the entrenched old-timers who continue to lord it over the rackets. He has cleared Manila’s streets but that’s only in the commercial district. But there is definitely more order now and Manila is cleaner.
The other problem Isko has is his glass ceiling is too low. Even if the desire to learn is there his absorptive capacity is limited. He also has this tendency to be a bit overconfident and go off saying more than he should like his interview with Karen Davila last week which he made of a fool of himself in. He should know better than to engage Davila in such a manner. If he runs, Isko counts on the support of MVP, the Ayala’s and the Lopez’s. Razon is a GMA boy and it remains to be seen if he will break with GMA to support Isko in case the latter decides to go with Sara, which is likely.
Daughterte is very much like her father. No bragging. Keeping her cards close to her chest. Her advantage is her political instincts, education as a lawyer and the Duterte brand. She has gone around the country as campaign manager of Hugpong in the 2019 midterm. Ethnic groups in Luzon are generally wary of the bisaya which resulted in a mixed reception for her. Her strongest point is her genuineness. She will not be caught obviously pandering to the crowd. The fact is, she’s leading in all the commissioned surveys I have seen. Isko is a far second. Vice President Leni Robredo is running between 4% – 7%. The President is being an imp again when he included Poe and Moreno is his list of potential anointed. This is sarcasm on his part.
The campaign this election cycle will be digital not traditional. Candidates will need to adjust to the disruption brought about by the pandemic. Digital’s advantage is the campaign can be data-driven. We have an excellent national statistician at the PSA who has demographic breakdowns per barangay. It will not be a walk in the park, not even for Daughterte. But given the field of competitors she’s facing, most Filipinos will probably think, if it ain’t broke, why fix it? Abangan.",Politics
Candidates need to meet the GENUINE SINCERITY standard to stand a chance in 2022. Very few of them do.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/candidates-need-to-meet-the-genuine-sincerity-standard-to-stand-a-chance-in-2022-very-few-of-them-do/,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was known to common Filipinos when he made the announcement about a possible Presidential run back in 2016. His “speaking tour” about federalism was actually a listening tour. He wanted to get  first-hand information on the people’s gripes. More important back then, the public had had it with then President Noynoy Aquino and then Interior Secretary Mar Roxas. It was one fiasco after the other beginning with the Luneta hostage incident. I’m not one into the paranormal but it seemed to me that while Aquino becoming President was ominous what with the death of his mother, former President Cory Aquino, paving the way for him, fate was playing a cruel trick by making him look incredibly stupid with each fiasco. It was like karma finally caught up with their family.
Duterte crafted his message simply. He didn’t make it convoluted. He spoke to the people in a manner they understood and he did so making it appear that he was one of them. He had the Presidency in the bag after the first debate. While messaging is important, the candidate’s natural charisma is key. For example, former Defense Secretary and 2010 presidential candidate Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro is well-qualified and experienced for any national elective post but his biggest problem is he doesn’t connect with voters. Most perceive him to be stiff. Sosyal. It doesn’t help that his wife is more stiff and more sosyal than him. A political operator’s problem is how to repackage Gibo so he is saleable. Same with Senator Ping Lacson. Lacson always has that stern demeanor. That turns off voters who want to see someone as both a father figure and the neighborhood kanto boy who’s friend to everyone in the community. Duterte checks those boxes as well.
Lacson comes off as effeminate with his metrosexual image. I’ve seen him up close in the 90s when I frequented Cebu and he was regional commander. Even his jeans are pressed. Manicured hands. Lacoste shirt. No hair out of place. Smells very good. Fair complexion. Sartorial dresser. Expensive watch. Messaging is nothing if you don’t connect with your audience. The masa can smell a fake a mile away. Look at how after five years Vice President Leni Robredo is nowhere near as popular as Duterte. Yellowidiots consistently paint Duterte as a dumbass but his vocabulary reveals he is well-read never mind his thick Bisaya accent. Can the same be said of Leni who can’t even get her thoughts in order? Genuine sincerity is hard to fake. Danding Cojuangco hated public speaking. But in a campaign rally, Danding knew how to work the crowds. This came from his experience in Tarlac. But during the debate for the 1992 election, he didn’t do well because he always froze in front of the camera. It didn’t help that perception of him was very bad to begin with.
Unfortunately for the Opposition, their “thought leaders” like PhilSTAR columnist Andrew J Masigan in his piece “Political messaging and creating a tribe” habitually oversimplify the factors in play that contribute to winnability…
My good friend and colleague in this paper, Boo Chanco, was correct when he said that the strength of a candidate’s social media trolls will determine who will become president in 2022. Trolls are today’s version of mass media, albeit without credibility. They are the preachers of a candidate’s “gospel.”
But just as important as the trolls are the messages they relay. As one who has studied the science of political messaging, let me share with you the inner workings of messaging in the context of a presidential campaign. I speak from experience, having been privy to a number of messaging programs of political leaders.
Political messaging is all about the 4P’s – Positioning, Philosophy, Proposition and Promise. The main objective of the 4P’s is to create a “tribe” of followers who display allegiance to their candidate and what he/she stands for.
The Opposition has bigger problems than what Chanco and Masigan have expounded on. Not all Filipinos who are on social media are trolls. Those who possess an excellent political gut feel swear by the sentiments expressed as genuine. There is no better proof than Mocha Uson. Her five million followers couldn’t get her elected as party-list representative. That’s because the following wasn’t 100% real and she didn’t know how to play that game. The Presidential endorsement she got couldn’t get her the win.
In 1987, we were made to believe that Cory was so popular that only Juan Ponce Enrile and Joseph “Erap” Estrada made it as the opposition candidates in the Senate. Truth is, they were the only two who couldn’t be cheated out of office. There’s more to campaigns than just simple messaging or social media presence. On election day you need to have a capable ground operation in place to bring out the vote and ensure you aren’t cheated. You have to make sure that the barangay captains who have taken monies deliver. We will have a better idea of what the state of the opposition is on June 12. That would be a good barometer as to the direction they’re headed in.",Politics
Would a Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem for 2022 win if Inday Sara Duterte does not run for president?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/would-a-ping-lacson-tito-sotto-tandem-for-2022-win-if-inday-sara-duterte-does-not-run-for-president/,"It was then Col. Gringo Honasan who first shot to fame post-Marcos in 1986 because Lacson found himself on the wrong side of the political divide in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) during the coup d’etat against then President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos. Lacson joined the Philippine Constabulary (PC) after graduation from the Philippine Military Academy (PMA). He was assigned to the Metropolitan Command, Metrocom for short. Metrocom was a buzzword during those days after the declaration of martial law. It was formed during the riots of the First Quarter Storm because the police were largely ineffective in containing the students. Fidel Ramos was the head of the Philippine Constabulary. Col. Rolando Abadilla was chief of the Metrocom Intelligence & Security Group (MISG). Lacson was an operative of the MISG which functioned both as an intelligence unit and one whose personnel were entrusted with sensitive missions like arresting an inebriated Mayor of San Juan who pissed on an erring cop in a fit of anger.
Lacson made his bones in the MISG along with Bobby Ortega, the illegitimate eldest son of Apo Lakay with Carmen Ortega, Bobby Calinisan and future coup plotter Rodolfo Aguinaldo, who would be promoted to head his own Constabulary Security Unit in Region 2 fighting the New People’s Army (NPA). Lacson wasn’t mustered out of the service after the 1986 EDSA Revolution because his Matatag 71 class at the PMA ruled over the AFP. Lacson became Laguna PC Provincial Commander and later, Regional Commander of PRO-7 based in Cebu. Lacson’s rescue of Robina Gokongwei from her kidnappers earned him his spurs. It wasn’t until 1992 that he began his rise to the top as the operations chief of Task Force Habagat under Erap’s PACC. We all know what happened after that.
Lacson is not your typical PMA graduate. For one, he doesn’t dress like a soldier. He looks more like he stepped out of a page of GQ Magazine, always well-dressed and well-groomed. Subtle elegance is his look and never a hair out of place. His first Presidential run in 2004 was perceived as a fluke to split the vote for actor Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ). He only obtained 3.5 million votes which was equivalent to 10% of the total votes cast. This was against a then-President who continues to be the most unpopular up to the present. It thus begs the question, how can Lacson muster a more credible showing in this election cycle against an incumbent who continues to be popular as his term ends?
Manila Times columnist Yen Makabenta in his piece “Lacson candidacy could shake, rattle and roll the 2022 presidential race” today writes, “Senators Lacson and [Senate President Tito] Sotto could quickly become serious and viable candidates for the two highest offices of the republic if they do two things when they announce their candidacy in the 2022 elections”…
First, they should run on a platform of conviction politics – of their fundamental values as politicians, and what they believe will best serve the nation and its purposes.
Second, they should go against the grain of the entrenched political culture of dynastic politics, pork barreling, money politics, parasitism on the public payroll, cronyism and patronage.
However, Lacson will surely be dogged by black propaganda because of controversies he has been involved in throughout his career in the service and politics. There is the murder of his close aide John Campos and the revelations of Rosebud Ong against him. The Kuratong Baleleng rubout at Commonwealth Avenue. The Dacer-Corbito murder case where he turned fugitive rather than subject himself to arrest and trial. His rift with Col. Reynaldo Berroya. The accusation that his son, Pampi, is engaged in the technical smuggling of cement made by then Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon. It doesn’t help that, this early in the game, Lacson has accused the administration of putting up troll farms on social media to use against its rivals in the election.
Lacson is an independent while Sotto is the Vice-Chairman of the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC). There is the question of which political party will serve as their official vehicle and that of their Senate slate and ground machinery. At this point, it’s looking to be a three-way race for the Presidency but nothing is cast in stone until the certificate of candidacy has been filed. Would you vote for Lacson-Sotto if Inday Sara Duterte does not run?",Politics
The Opposition wasted time looking for a “silver bullet” vs Duterte instead of crafting an intelligent campaign,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-opposition-wasted-time-looking-for-a-silver-bullet-vs-duterte-instead-of-crafting-an-intelligent-campaign/,"We are under a fascist, authoritarian dictatorship. This is the impression you get after reading Boo Chanco’s PhilSTAR column “Hearts and minds” today. This is the second in a row about what the opposition must do in order to win in 2022. Chanco quotes from an article published by a millennial PhD candidate Cleve Arguelles:
As the pandemic worsens and democracy erodes, Duterte remains popular. His blessing will still give any aspiring president a clear advantage. Duterte’s populist politics (Dutertismo) mobilizes public support through a mix of coercion and charisma.
Over the past five years, his government has undermined democracy, human rights and civil liberties while consolidating local and national political control. With the election just a year away, Dutertismo appears to be ready for a second term.
Arguelles is part of the group of millennials composed mostly of JC Punongbayan and other like-minded academics who are in the  early to mid-thirties — all liberals or neoliberals against the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. They would like nothing more than see the government provide dole-outs not only to the poor but to everyone affected by the pandemic; a tall order given the precarious economic situation the country finds itself in. To them, the government has not done thing right in the last five years. Chanco, as a veteran PR operator and newsman seems to omit one very important fact. If what he claims is true, why is it that Duterte remains popular.  His explanation is Duterte has tapped into the basic fear of Pinoys which is law and order. But wait. The same case was made by Duterte during his Presidential campaign. This was exactly one of the issues which propelled him to victory. If this is his only achievement in five years, why doesn’t he follow in the same path as Aquino who was detested as he was about to step down?
Think about it. The truth is, Duterte remains popular because of his achievements. Corruption and red tape still exist. Drugs are still on the streets but not as commonplace as before when you could buy shabu from your neighborhood sari-sari store. Rapes and robberies are down. Infrastructure projects have been completed. Virtually every government department and agency have new equipment. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) have been modernized, though there are still scalawags in the PNP. Disaster response has greatly improved. In terms of pandemic response, we still don’t have a unified contact-tracing system. We are behind in testing, tracing and treatment compare to other countries. The number of new cases daily hasn’t gone down to below 3,000 per day since January. There are more cases in the regions than the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). The vaccines have arrived but are still in short supply because rich countries cornered production. China and Russia have donated and sold vaccines to the country. Virtually every country that the opposition has cited as having better pandemic response have suffered surges. Malaysia is in lockdown. Singapore is battling the Indian variant. Taiwan has experienced a surge and is behind in vaccination rate. Our economy is still in a recession and it looks like it will be for the rest of the year. Inflation is running at 5%.
Why is Duterte still popular? The Opposition has thrown everything it can at him but nothing has stuck. What gives? Simply put, Duterte broke the mold of the typical President. He is not your typical President in any aspect. He has given his economic managers free rein to run the economy. He is hands on when it comes to foreign policy and peace and order. He has fired Cabinet members for their involvement in corruption. He hasn’t been linked directly to any scandal. His language is still the same. His messaging is still the same. The truth is, the Opposition don’t have anything on him that resembles a silver bullet that could take him down. They don’t even has a viable Presidential candidate for 2022. Chanco stops short of saying that Filipinos have been put under a spell cast by a group of barangs from Siquijor to ensure Duterte remains popular.
The singular truth is that the Opposition has failed at being the fiscalizer because they have focused more on destablization and demolition jobs. Filipinos believe the Opposition is being elitist and rightly so because they only give lip service to the masses. On June 12, the opposition will gather to select the members of their supposedly unified slate for the 2022 election. There will be no new faces. No contenders. No personalities who have the gravitas to take Duterte head-on. Karma has caught up with the opposition for their past sins to the Filipino people. There is no fight left in them. The battle is lost even before it began. It was lost on May 9, 2016.",Politics
"Dilawan Party’s DNA of Divisive Politics, Dynastic Politics at Kilatis Sa Politika ng Quezon City",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/dilwan-partys-dna-of-divisive-politics-dynastic-politics-at-kilatis-sa-politika-ng-quezon-city/,"Dilawan Party is Doomed by its Genetic Predisposition for Divisive Politics
Maraming nag-react at comment dun sa huling post ko tungkol sa inaasahang pagtakbo ni Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte bilang Pangulo sa 2022 at sa pag-angat ng mga local government executives bilang hanay na pinagkukunan ng posibleng kandidato sa mga pambansang elective positions.
To be sure, hindi lang si Mayor Inday Sara ang lumutang na local executive na kinukonsidera bilang kandidato sa pagka-pangulo. Andyan rin si Mayor Vico Sotto ng Pasig, ang Yorme naming mga Manilenyo na si Francisco Domagoso alyas Isko Moreno, at si Gapan Mayor Emeng Pascual sa Nueva Ecija.
Sa akin, magandang senyales ito na sa wakas, gets na rin ng karamihan sa ating mga kababayan ang idea na ang Pangulo ay executive or tagapagpatupad, at ang dapat bigyan ng mas mabigat na konsiderasyon sa posisyong ito eh yung may  matitinding pruweba bilang executive.
Either that, or, sa wakas nagkalakas ng loob na rin magpakatutoo sa pagboto at ang tutoo eh ang gusto ng mas nakakarami na lider eh iyong tipong BOSS o AMO.
Ito yung tipong lider na kapag may inutos, maraming sumusunod at walang choice ang iba kungdi ang sumunod. Parang sa trabaho lang, or sa loobang tinitirahan kung saan may iisang sinusundan at kinakatakutan na banggain.
Ito rin yung tipong lider na nalalapitan tuwing may tulong na kailangan o aberyang nangyari.
Iyong tipong pinaka-barako sa mga barako.
In fact, itong imaheng ganito ang tingin kong nagdala kay dating Vice President Jejomar Binay sa taluktok ng kanyang political career bilang kandidato sa pagka Pangulo nuong 2016.
Mula sa mala-sacristan na pamumuno ni Pnoy, naghanap ang mga tao ng Pangulong brusko na mukhang kakatakutan kahit ng mga demonyo.
Si Binay na sana iyon. Kung patigasan na rin lang ang lalabanan, si Binay siguro eh parang gulong ng trak sa tigas. Kaso natapatan siya ng mala asero naman ang tigas, isang Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte na tila lahat ng aspeto ng pagkatao balot ng katigasan — pati dila matigas.
Bukod diyan, nabakbakan si Binay ng husto bilang pangunahing kandidato nuon.
Dagdag pa diyan ang pagka watak-watak ng kampo ni Pnoy na waring patunay na walang pagkakaisa sa prinsipyo at kanya-kanyang interes ang nangingibabaw. Patunay rin na puppet lang si Pnoy ng mga interes na nagluklok sa kanya, hindi siya boss or amo na may kakayanang timunin at balansehin ang mga magkakasalungat na interes.
Nahati ang sanay solid force ng mga Coryista — isang sinaunang political cult na lumitaw nung napatalsik sa pwesto si dating Pangulong Ferdinand Marcos ng isang military junta. Ito yung kulto kung saan lahat ng basbasan ni Cory eh mabuti at dapat suportahan — kahit mali, gaya na lamang nung halos pikit matang ratification ng 1987 Philippine Constitution.
Bukod kay Binay, tumakbo rin si Mar Roxas at si Grace Poe na pawang dilawan. Bale ang nangyari, pinagtulungan ni Mar at ni Grace si Binay… Ayun, kahit puti ng mata nagkalatay.
Kahit ba sa usaping partido partido, itong Liberal Party na sinasabing dilawan party eh mahaba ang kasaysayan bilang partidong bitak-bitak at hindi solid. Mayroon dati itong Drilon Faction, Roxas Faction, Defensor Faction, at kung ano anong grupo na naglalaban-laban para kilalanin na tunay na Liberal Party.
At paano naman magkakaruon ng solid supporters ang mga ito? Eh sa kalakaran nilang pinakita sa mahabang panahon, sariling interes lang nila talaga ang pinaglalaban. Tsaka ko na ungkatin sa ibang blog post kung ano ano ang mga asta ng bawat isang paksyon kung kaya’t di nila makuha ang amor ng ordinaryong tao.
Non-enactment of an Anti-Political Dynasty Law Says Dynastic Politics is the NORM
Na-inspire ako ng bahagya sa sinulat ni Benedict Exconde tungkol sa dynastic politics.
Sangayon ako sa sinabi niya na ang malaking dahilan kung bakit namayapa ang dynastic politics sa bansa eh dahil rin sa term limits na nakabaon sa 1987 Constitution at sa Local Government Code.
Ang madadagdag ko sa sinabi niya, at ito ang pinakadahilan kung bakit may naghahari ang mga political dynasties sa bansa: lampas tatlumpung dekada nang hindi naipapasa ng Senate at House of Representatives ang enabling law na kailangan para maisakatuparan ang probisyon ng Cory Constitution na nagbabawal sa political dynasty.
Ayon sa Article II Section 26: “The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.“
Isa lang ang ibig sabihin ng hindi pagpasa ng anti-Political Dynasty Law: Gusto ng mga mambabatas na kinatawan nating lahat ang  pagkakaruon ng Political Dynasty. (Mismo ngang mga nagsalang ng anti-Political Dynasty bill eh mga miyembro ng political dynasty. Asa pa tayong papasa yan sa third reading. Walang ganun! Haha!)
Di lang siguro makapagsalita ng deretsahan ang ating mga mababatas dahil pinagbabawal ito ng Constitution at baka maakusahan pa na lumalabag sila sa Saligang Batas.
Pinapatunayan rin nito na mananaig ang cultural norm sa kung ano mang sistema ang nais ipatupad. Malaking katangahan ang maniwalang system change will lead to culture change — it has never happened and will never happen.
Ang mas tutoo eh ang mga batas ng bansa eh nagmumula sa kultura ng mga taong bumubuo dito. HIndi mababago ng buo ang kultura ng bansa ng isang bigayan. Unti-unti yang binabago, tulad ng lahat ng bagay sa mundo.
Right now, mukhang okay lang  o gustong gusto ng karamihan sa mga bumoboto sa atin ang pagkakaruon ng mga magkakamaganak na politiko na nakaupo sa iba’t ibang posisyon ng pamahalaan.
Bilang issue laban kay Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, walang kwenta ang isyung political dynasty laban sa kanya. FACTS lang yang dynasty dynasty, ikanga.
Labanan ng mga Dynasty sa QC
Sa pinakamalaking lungsod in terms of population, hindi issue ang dynastic politics.
In fact, masasabi na ang nagluluklok sa alkalde ng Quezon City eh ang koalisyon ng mga political dynasties na sinasabing pinamumunuan ng pamilyang Belmonte.
Sinasabing nagsimula ang koalisyong ito nuong 2001 sa pagkapanalo ni Sonny Belmonte bilang mayor, nagpatuloy sa ilalim ng pamumuno ni dating mayor Herbert Bautista, at hanggang sa ngayon, si Joy Belmonte — anak ni dating Mayor Sonny — ang nakaupo.
Bukod kay Mayora Joy Belmonte, nakaupo rin ang ilang kamaganakan nila tulad nila:
Kung tatakbo naman si Anakalusugan Congressman Mike Defensor bilang mayor ng QC, malamang tumiba ito sa balwarte nito sa 3rd District ng Quezon City. Nagsalitan sila Mike ng kanyang ama na si Matias Jr. at kapatid na si Maite bilang congressman ng 3rd District. Ang lolo ni Mike na si Matias Sr. eh naging mayor ng Quezon City mula 1946 hanggang 1948.
Pero mukhang hindi lang sa 3rd District makakakuha ng suporta si Mike kasi kasangga naman niya si Congressman Onyx Crisologo, na anak ni dating Congressman Bingbong Crisologo ng 1st District ng Quezon City.
Di ko lang alam kung magiging factor ang relasyon ng mga Crisologo kay Luis “Chavit” Crisologo Chavit Singson na halos kadikit ng pangalan ni Senator Manny Pacquiao.
Pero kung may ibabansag man ako sa alyansa ni Mike at ng mga Crisologo, siguro maganda ang Team Revival o Team Negosyo. (Sorry na lang sa nakaisip sa pausong Malayang Quezon City. Malaya saan? Malaya, papaano? Baka naman hango lang yan sa pagiging Liberal Party ni boss Mike dati, eh masyadong literal naman at the same time pag-iisipin mo pa tao kung ano ibig sabihin niyan. Peyups na peyups ang datingan.)
Bakit kanyo Team Revival? Eh kasi nabuhay uli si Mike sa mundo ng politika matapos nitong maging minero ng ilang taon. Tapos si tatay Bingbong naman eh matagal nang kilala sa Catholic revival ministry niya.
Bakit kanyo Team Negosyo? Eh dun lang sa kampanya ni dating Congressman Bingbong, lahat ng may kinalaman sa business tax at property tax ang naging issue niya. Pati nga Quezon Memorial Circle gusto niyang negosyohin para sa mga taga Quezon City sa pamamagitan ng pagtatayo ng isang sports coliseum.
Si Mike naman, matagal nang kinakampyon ang pagtatayo ng Quezon City Business District na tulad ng BGC o Makati. Sa naalala ko, ito’y dapat sa bandang Trinoma ilalagay, duon sa area kung saan marami pang mga mahihirap ang nakatira. Napakagandang proyekto, kung ako ang tatanungin. Kung meron mang kakayang mag clear ng mga pamilya sa lugar na iyon at iba pang lugar sa Quezon City na may informal settler, si Mike na yan. Nakita ko kung gaano siya ka effective sa pag-clear ng PNR kung saan daang libong informal settler ang natanggal.
Bukod kay Mike, isa pang sinasabing maaaring mag challenge kay Mayora Joy eh si Councilor Winnie Castelo. Tulad ng mga Belmonte, malawak-lawak rin ang sakop ng pamilya ni Councilor Winnie at maraming mga Castelo na councilor rin sa ibang distrito ng Quezon City. Bukod pa diyan ang asawa niya na si Congresswoman Precious.
Kaso lang, ayon sa aking source, baka too early pa na tumakbo si Councilor Winnie. Baka daw sa 2025 pa niya i-consider ang pagtakbo bilang Quezon City Mayor at hindi pa daw siya hinog.
Maniniwala na sana ako pero, mukhang naka set-up na ng husto ang makinarya niya para maging matinding mayoralty candidate. Ang lalim na nang naibaon na pakikisama at tulong niyan sa napakaraming distrito.
Between Mike and Winnie, tingin ko mas serious na challenger itong si Councilor Winnie kay Mike.",Politics
Kiko Pangilinan ABANDONING Opposition to focus on his own re-election!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/kiko-pangilinan-abandoning-opposition-to-focus-on-his-own-re-election/,"You know the Opposition is in trouble when the President of the Liberal Party claims he is busy with his reelection campaign. Ana Marie Pamintuan in her PhilSTAR piece today “First, get out the vote” writes how “Sen. Francis Pangilinan has his mind on Sept. 30, 2021, the deadline for the registration of new voters.”
This time, it doesn’t look like Pangilinan intends to take a similarly active role in the opposition campaign in 2022. He’s up for reelection and he wants to focus on his own campaign…
It certainly didn’t leave a mark in my mind after 2016 that party chair Vice President Leni Robredo and Kiko are the top honchos of the Yellow Party. Amidst all the political noise caused by the Opposition, the question which has never been asked is, why is it that Kiko isn’t a convenor of 1Sambayan? Who died and made Antonio Carpio the sovereign of 1Sambayan? How many opposition parties are in actual existence?
For example, is the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) of the Binays part of the Opposition? The truth is, the opposition under former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was, during her time, more united than the opposition to current President Rodrigo Duterte will ever be going into the May 2022 polls. At least they weren’t shut out during midterm elections as in the case of Otso-Diretso in 2019. Even with the 60-30-10 formula in place for the 2013 midterm, the opposition then still managed to eke out Senate wins.
1Sambayan holds its landmark event today, which is Araw ng Kalayaan(“freedom day”). The symbolism is we are under an “authoritarian fascist dictatorship” under Duterte which compels us to break free from its shackles. I don’t know about you, but do you actually believe we are in such a socio-political environment?
We will know more about the direction the Opposition intends to take by the end of this day. For the past five years, the Opposition has provided us with entertainment. I don’t expect that to change any time soon.",Politics
GRAVITAS is what makes Philippine presidents. Not popularity. And certainly NOT PA-CUTE.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/gravitas-is-what-makes-philippine-presidents-not-popularity-and-certainly-not-pa-cute/,"And we come down to this? Does De La Salle University (DLSU) professor and Manila Times columnist Antonio Contreras even have a realistic point of view of how politicians come into power? Doesn’t look like it when one considers this post of his on Facebook where he practically endorses boxer-turned-senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao’s bid for the Philippine presidency…
For one, there has to be an element of gravitas in a politician who aspires for the country’s top job. Not too many male politicians possess this trait. Among the female of the species, only former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) measures up to the standard. Does President Rodrigo Duterte have gravitas? He wouldn’t have run for the Presidency if he didn’t. Most people thought he was dilly-dallying back in the lead up to 2016. Behind the dumbass exterior he projects to the public he isn’t as stupid as most of the opposition think.
Please allow me to go further. Does former Senator Bongbong Marcos have gravitas? Sorry to say but, in my opinion, he doesn’t even come close to his father former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos. Marcos Jr. is the sentimental favorite, but if you saw that picture of him sobbing uncontrollably during his father’s funeral at Makiki Heights, you will get the impression that that was the moment the boy became a man. I hated GMA with a compunction until the 2008 financial crisis. After that, I appreciated her because she had the balls to ram down our collective throats the, at the time, hugely-unpopular Value-Added Tax (VAT). It was only after that when I learned a valuable lesson in practical economics.
Let’s go into the mindset now. Are we naive enough to believe that GMA was really more corrupt than her predecessors? What exactly is our benchmark? Is it the Yellow benchmark as defined by Mon Jimenez for former President Noynoy Aquino? According to Aquino, kung walang kurap, walang mahirap (“where there is no corruption, there is no poverty”). Has any concrete proof of this idea emerged after six years of Aquino Part 2?
I was a devoted Yellowtard from 1983-1986. Because of the nature of my employment in 1990, I started doing business with with the Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. (ECJ) Group. It was then that my eyes were opened to the realities.  It was also at this time that Larry Henares was writing about the Cojuangco family history in his Inquirer column. “Le Tableaux de Doña Ysidra”, if my memory serves me right, was the title of the series. Boss Danding was never a rent-seeking oligarch. He had the benefit of money but not in the same manner as the Cojuangco branch of Cory Aquino.
Pre-1986, the rich were mostly the working rich. In the same mold as Boss Danding was Enrique Zobel. His cousin Jaime Zobel De Ayala (JAZA) never went through what he did in World War II. But look at Ayala now under the sons of JAZA. Why do you think Enzo sold his San Miguel shares when there was a family dispute? San Miguel was a good company until Ramon S. Ang (RSA) came into the picture. San Miguel is now a house of cards. Does RSA have the gravitas to follow in ECJs footsteps? No. Back in the day, it wasn’t media hype and popularity which drove men with gravitas to seek the Presidency. It was about the vision. Danding was never the consummate politician Apo Lakay was. But he shared Marcos’ vision along with a few other Marcos cronies who weren’t in it just for the money and the power.
So does Pac-Man have the gravitas? Sus ginoo!!! Daghang pa gyud ang kan-on na gi-kaon ni Pac-Man bag-o man siya naa nay gravitas. Leni Robredo has gravitas? Trillanes? Please not even as a joke. Men who have gravitas do not seek the Presidency just because of popularity or the perception of it. Men who have gravitas are innately endowed to wield power without looking at the money that comes with it as their goal.",Politics
June 12 “Freedom Day” marks the ironic end of @1Sambayan,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/june-12-freedom-day-marks-the-ironic-end-of-1sambayan/,"Hare-brained 1Sampayan. Supposed democracy advocates actually killed democracy today. Why? The holier-than-thou attitude was disastrous. It wasn’t even long before the named candidates were declining their “nominations.” It was supposed to be a “democratic” process but as it turned out the convenors made the decision without even bothering to consult the personalities on their list. It might as well have been a coronation of Leni Robredo and Antonio Trillanes.
From the opening video, it is clearly evident that they have not leaned a single thing about the 2019 Otso Diretso loss and are already making the SAME mistake again.
The recurring theme of the messaging is “‘change”. Trite emo slogans and songs highlighting the victimhood of Filipinos asking “when will Filipinos rise up” are juxtaposed against grim imagery. That says something about the sort of campaign we can expect from these people — the usual negative sort.
The next question is, will Robredo run now that she got what she wanted? Judging by the tepid public response to the event, she will surely lose. Surveys may be snapshots of the present but she’s had five years to build up her national base. At this point she can only count on the votes in Region 5, her bailiwick, and probably the National Capital Region (NCR). But if Manila Mayor Isko Moreno runs, and from all indicators he probably will, he will take votes away from Robredo. Isko’s glass ceiling is low. He will hit it easily and the public will see through it. This is the perfect opportunity for the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem. Sources have confirmed that the two senior Senators will team up. This means it will likely be a three-way race for the Presidency.
There will be political realignments in the offing. It depends now on who President Rodrigo Duterte will anoint. If Inday Sara “Daughterte” Duterte is not running then Bongbong Marcos will. Who will be his running mate? Daughterte would be the ideal. She would beat Poe and Sotto. Another option would be a Marcos-Pacman (Manny Pacquiao) tandem but the glass ceiling of Pac-Man is lower than Isko. Sotto could beat him given his experience and the following of Dabarkads. This might turn out to be a repeat of 1992 where Danding Cojuangco lost but Joseph “Erap” Estrada won. A Marcos-Sotto tandem out of the ballot box isn’t bad. The X factor is former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). She’s been too silent for comfort and whenever she is, that means something is up.
The reports of the Opposition’s death hadn’t been greatly exaggerated. They’ve been dead since 2016. But like former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos, their interment had been delayed. Isn’t it ironic that they picked June 12 to hammer in the final nail on their coffin? Good riddance.",Politics
"“Birthday visit” raises possible Duterte-Gibo tandem, throws Opposition into further panic",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/birthday-visit-raises-possible-duterte-gibo-tandem-throws-opposition-into-further-panic/,"Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro who served as Defense Secretary under former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was President Rodrigo Duterte’s (PRRD’s) initial choice for Defense Secretary. However, Gibo declined for undisclosed reasons. Recently, he signified his intent to run in 2022 but would not disclose the office again. What does Gibo bring to the table as a potential running mate of Davao City Mayor presidential daughter Inday Sara Duterte? Teodoro is a Master’s of Law graduate from Harvard and a bar top-notcher to boot. His uncle, Danding Cojuangco was grooming him for a Presidential run but they had a misunderstanding in the run-up to the 2010 election. The rising star of the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) then was Chiz Escudero. Teodoro felt marginalized and accepted the offer of GMA to be her Defense Secretary. He had the background for it as an Air Force reservist since he is a qualified pilot for jet and propeller aircraft.
Teodoro ran and lost in the 2010 election for President. Gibo had a problem with his messaging connecting with the masa even if he was well-honed by Danding in Tarlac politics. This was his initial foray into national office and he was up against former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada, then Senator Manny Villar, religious leader Eddie Villanueva, then Senator Richard Gordon, and, his second cousin, Noynoy Aquino. Gibo placed a distant fourth in the race. The ruling Lakas-CMD was wracked by internal wranglings and defections. This was primarily due to the groundswell of support for Noynoy Aquino brought about by former President Cory Aquino’s death in August 2009. The Liberal Party was set to crown then Senator Mar Roxas as its standard-bearer. As events unfurled, Roxas had to give way to Aquino.
Filipinos seemed to have been bitten by the nostalgia bug as they came out for Cory’s funeral. The optics was excellent. Still, there were a few pundits who thought the election was rigged. Sentiments ran high against the GMA because of the perceived fraud during the 2004 election where she beat the late actor Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ). For Erap, he was out for vindication. Convicted and pardoned for plunder, Erap knew he would need to take it to his beloved masa for their judgment. Despite not having an extensive political machinery unlike in 1998 and a shortage in funding, he still came in second. The skeptics couldn’t believe that Aquino beat him by 5M votes. Teodoro laid low until the Arroyo administration stepped down from office. He never reoconciled with his uncle. It didn’t help that this was also about the same time the Cojuangco family was in the midst of personal issues since Danding moved out of the conjugal home he shared with his wife and came out in the open about his relationship with former beauty queen Leng Damiles, with whom he had two daughters.
The effort that Danding put into grooming Gibo didn’t bear fruit. Escudero didn’t become a Presidential candidate owing to his obscene demand that he receive P1 billion aside from the campaign funds he wanted to be guaranteed by the NPC. A tandem consisting of Inday Sara Duterte and Teodoro, if indeed in the works, would probably be saleable to the Filipinos. Gibo brings with him policy-making and legislative experience. He is also well-versed in economic issues as he has spent time on the boards of several corporations since 2010. He would be a wise counsel to a neophyte President in Inday who has excellent political instincts but not enough experience in the legislative, economic and policy-making aspects of governance where Gibo’s strength lies. In short, it is a practical and complementary tandem, if it does materialize.
While former Senator Bongbong Marcos is the sentimental favorite as Inday’s running mate, Marcos would be too divisive as the main issues pertinent to the election would be lost as the Opposition is sure to spin it back to what his father former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos did during his time. This was particularly evident during the 2016 election. The race was close but the exit polls had Marcos winning by a comfortable margin. But in a race where there were more Vice-Presidential than Presidential candidates, it was easy to rob Marcos of victory. The votes were there for the taking and the PR spin would work against him. Then Liberal Party vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo was immediately cast as the giant-slayer which was perfect for her narrative; the reluctant widow pushed into the Vice-Presidency for the greater good.
The past five years have proven, based on her persistently low approval and trust ratings, that Robredo did not win the 2016 race. The cloud of electoral fraud continues to hang over her head despite the unanimous dismissal of the electoral protest filed by Marcos. This move could also be part of the short-term plan of the administration power blocs to finally get the country to take-off economically. Bongbong can easily win a Senate seat. Given that he has the gravitas with his landmark work on the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Law, he could easily become the Majority Leader or even Senate President. Charter change would definitely be on the agenda and an administration landslide could pave the way for Constitutional amendments. This would allow Duterte to make good on his promise of a federal parliamentary government. A unicameral legislature could see Marcos become Prime Minister in the future.
It’s very evident that the Opposition doesn’t even have a narrow window of opportunity in 2022 despite their claim that they are the silent majority. Trillanes has been hobbled by his libel conviction. This leaves the field open to Robredo. It is doubtful if Poe or Isko would submit to 1Sambayan’s selection process. Any mark of Yellow in the coming polls is political suicide on any outsider selected as the standard-bearer. More than likely a new opposition will rise as the old one is already starving for campaign funds this early in the game.",Politics
NOBODY wants to lead the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/nobody-wants-to-lead-the-philippine-opposition/,"June 12 may be just eight days Way but it may as well be six months from now. In just the last ten days since dominant Opposition coalition 1Sambayan announced its plan to announce its candidates on what some people believe to be the Philippines’ “Independence Day”, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte has pretty much been crowned the administration presidential candidate for the 2022 national elections. And over those ten days, no less than three vice presidential candidates have emerged from the woodwork; former Senator Bongbong Marcos, former Defense Secretary Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro, and Inday Sara’s father and current President Rodrigo Duterte.
What can happen over the next eight days? Very likely a lot more than what happened in that last ten. One thing’s for sure, however, 1Sambayan will continue to keep Filipinos waiting. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. Whether they back one candidate or another, they will not win against the administration camp. This is particularly considering that they have not changed a key pillar of their messaging, their anti-Duterte rhetoric — a drum they’ve been beating since 2016, through their catastrophic loss in the 2019 midterm elections, and now as they approach the runway to 2022. The mediocrity of the Philippine Opposition is captured in a tweet recently fielded by Opposition personality and convenor of the partisan group Kaya Natin, Harvey Keh…
Evidently, the notion of an Opposition that should have had its act together and been working hard on strategic intent long ago to begin with routinely escapes Opposition “thought leaders” like Keh. Really, their lot should stop being merely reactive (specially to admin camp movements) and be a bit more proactive around a compelling and competing vision for the Philippines — if they can come up with one. If not, all they are really defining themselves and any candidate who runs under their banner as is an anti-[insert admin candidate here] force and not much else.
Thing is, even the lazy option to be merely reactive is not something 1Sambayan is in a position to enjoy given that it seems committed to remain tight-lipped until our so-called “Independence Day”. Meanwhile, the community of Opposition social media “influencers” and institutional “thought leaders”, lacking any guidance or unifying leadership, will continue to be the loose cannons that fire words and messages that do nothing to erase the yellow political shade that stains pretty much the entire Opposition camp and, worse, only further degrades the already failed brand of 1Sambayan.",Politics
Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte and The Rise to National Prominence of Local Government Executives,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/davao-city-mayor-inday-sara-duterte-and-the-rise-to-national-prominence-of-local-government-executives/,"To be sure, former Davao City Mayor and now President Rodrigo Roa Duterte wasn’t the first local government executive to have risen to national prominence through a presidential bid.
But I guess his win in 2016 may be written down by some as a turning point in our history of elections when people began looking at local executives (governors and mayors) as serious contenders for the country’s presidency.
He broke the mold of previous winning presidential candidates who usually had national prominence first before seeking the Presidency in the Post EDSA 86 era.
Now, with the incipient candidacy of his daughter Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, we may yet see another historic and game changing presidential election win in 2022.
Not only will this be the first time that another local government executive will start a succession of local government executives elected as president, it might also be the first time that the daughter of a sitting president will take over the reins of power.
Even better, we may even see Duterte the daughter rise as President with her father as Vice President.
Unprecedented, indeed!
Some may describe this as a consolidation of a national political dynasty and say that such dynasties are a bad thing.
But I would point out that the country’s largest and longest running enterprises in business as well as in politics happen to be run mostly by dynasties.
Dynasties, as Senator Richard Gordon once told me personally, are not a bad thing per se.
He said that there are dynasties that advance the society that engenders them  and are considered good in many respects; these ones continue for as long as they can. Then, there are also bad dynasties which commit acts that lead to the disintegration of society, its very foundations, and these ones are eventually destroyed.
Moreover, I guess it is time to admit that political dynasties are actually the norm in Philippine politics. Just Google: “Philippine political families” and you will see that there is practically no area in the country not held by one or another political dynasty. These dynasties appear either as a succession of the same last names in the same positions or the same last names in different positions within the same time period and locality.
It’s really a no brainer as to why no anti-dynasty bill will ever pass into law.
Thing is, if political dynasties come to being and continue to exist, there ought to be other reasons for it to happen other than just the flippant condemnation that Filipinos are just corrupt or backward.
I’ve heard it said that if the Singsons or Marcoses were completely taken out of power, our Ilokos provinces would be put in disarray and its people locked in violent political feuds for domination. Moreover, the Ilokos region continues to post healthy economic growth and is the 8th largest contributor to the country’s GDP as of 2018.
Political dynasties, it would seem, stabilize the country’s politics and economy better than the fleshless creatures which we call principles and laws.
Perhaps these term limits as well as the notion of banning political dynasties were artificially and irrationally conceived as a palliative reaction to the twenty year Marcos rule that preceded it.
Instead of working with and enhancing the beneficial aspects of our cultural norms for political succession and expansion, an automatic limit was imposed on all without regard for whether the incumbent political leader and his clan could continue to deliver good governance; or if there were aspirants whose capabilities equal or even surpass that of the incumbent.
Instead of freeing the people to decide on the length of a leader’s reign, it locked us up in perpetual  cycles of very costly electoral contests.
Given the fact that we have a large number of families doing round robins in elective positions or occupying the whole roster of elective positions at the same time and given that this appears to be the norm of current political practices, it behooves our legislators to remove the backward looking constitutional provision on automatic term limits as well as the ban on political dynasties.
Perhaps, in its place, legislature can devise a performance based system for determining whether a political leader should continue or be booted out.
On the political front closer to my home, Quezon City’s political elite is in a struggle to determine whether to continue the reign of the Belmonte coalition or break it up in favor of a new political coalition.
My acquaintances, who are somewhat involved in Quezon City politics, have an impression that Mayor Joy Belmonte’s hold on power may be weak and her performance sorely lacking.
This is quite contrary to a recent independent survey conducted by RP-Mission and Development Foundation Inc. (RPMD) which says that QC Mayor Joy is the top performing local chief executive in the National Capital Region (NCR), The survey results were based on face-to-face interviews with 3,500 respondents, who were asked to rate their respective mayors regarding their overall job performance for 2020.
Take the survey for what you will, but there are names that keep cropping up as challengers to current QC Mayor.
These are:
Anakalusugan Party-list Representative Michael “Mike” Tan Defensor. He was my former big boss when he was the HUDCC Chairman and was largely credited for clearing informal settlers from the PNR embankments. After his stint as former President Gloria Arroyo’s number 1 guy and DENR Secretary, he ran for Quezon City Mayor in 2010 and ended up topping the other also-rans with 130,000 votes against Herbert Bautista who garnered over 500,000 votes.
For some time, he stepped away from politics and focused on steering one or several mining firms. Then after his hiatus from politics and government, he ran as the second nominee of Anakalusugan party-list in 2019 and when the party-list won a seat, he emerged as its representative.
Mike has somewhat of a colorful political career with a couple of misadventures that I will tell you about in a future post.
Quezon City Councilor Winston “Winnie” Castelo. He is possibly the best known Quezon City councilor with a career spanning 26 years.
He was QC Councilor from 1995–2004 and then again from 2019 to this present day.
I assume he took a break from 2004 to 2009 before running and winning as Congressman 2nd District of Quezon City in 2010. He made consecutive runs for the same position and held it up to 2019. Thereafter, running for QC Councilor and winning.
He doesn’t have a Wikipedia entry that summarizes his rather lengthy career and accomplishments, but he does have a building with his name on it that serves as a landmark in his district. From various accounts, Winnie is big on giving away ayuda long before the COVID19 pandemic hit us and is well loved by the people in his district.
The Castelos are one of the families that dominate Quezon City politics.
His wife, Precious Hipolito-Castelo is the current Congresswoman of Quezon City’s 2nd district and was 2nd District councilor from 2010–2019.
His sister, Nanette Castelo-Daza, was congresswoman of Quezon City’s 4th district from 2001 to 2010. His niece, Jessica Castelo-Daza, was 4th district councilor from 2010 to 2016. Other relatives occupying legislative positions in the city are Karl Edgar Castelo in the 5th district (a position he has occupied since 2013) and Bobby Castelo in the 6th district (a position he has been in since 2013).
Former congressman Bingbong Crisologo. Of the would-be contenders for Quezon City Mayor, perhaps Bingbong is the only one whose family isn’t so deeply rooted  the city’s history or dominates the landscape.  The only other Crisologos holding an elective position is his son Onyx, who was elected congressman of the 1st District — a position that Bingbong formerly held until his run for QC Mayor in 2019 which he lost by a hundred thousand votes.
When I was in my early teens in the early 1980s, I used to see Bingbong a lot in the Galas area. I didn’t know him as a politician but as a leader of a Catholic movement geared towards catechism for the youth.
His religiosity is one of the things he is best known for after being pardoned by former President Ferdinand Marcos for arson which he committed in 1970 in Ilocos Sur.
The other crime appended to his name is malversation thru falsification of public documents for anomalous pork barrel projects in 2009. He was indicted by the Ombudsman but dismisses the charge as being politically motivated.
Senator Tito Sotto. His son Gian is currently Vice Mayor of Quezon City and if Senator Sotto does run for Mayor, would he run with his son?
Perhaps it would be a catchy a headline as the father-daughter teaming of Inday Sarah Duterte for President and outgoing president Duterte as Vice President.
To the national team up of Duterte-Duterte, maybe we will see Quezon City coming up with a Sotto-Sotto.
But, anyway, Sotto’s political roots are deep and the landscape his last name occupies is quite broad.
Sotto’s paternal grandfather and namesake was former senator Vicente Sotto (1877–1950). Vicente’s brother, Filemon (1872–1966) also served as a senator and was one of those who drafted the 1935 Constitution.
He was vice mayor of Quezon City from 1988 to 1992. Then served two terms as senator from 1992 to 2004. After a brief absence from politics, he won as senator again in 2010 and ran for re-election in 2016.
Apart from Senator Tito and Vice Mayor Gian, the other Sottos in public office are:
`Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, Lala Sotto who has been serving as councilor of the 6th District of Quezon City since 2013 and Wahoo Sotto who has been serving as councilor of the 2nd district of Parañaque City also since 2013.
To be fair to these gentlemen, I haven’t come across any news of them saying that they were even considering a run for the Quezon City Mayoralty. The only way to know for sure is if they file their certificate of candidacy for QC Mayor in October.
But, supposing they are running against Mayor Joy’s possible re-election bid, so everything is still up in the air.",Politics
Political dynasties are not necessarily bad,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/political-dynasties-are-not-necessarily-bad/,"Election fever in the Philippines is slowly heating up. Early opinion polls suggest that Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte, is the leading possible candidate for President in 2022. “Inday Sara,” as the lady mayor is widely known, is, so far, enjoying a comfortable lead over her potential opponents, including Vice President Leni Robredo and other personalities from the opposition. The possibility of Inday Sara succeeding her father Rodrigo Duterte as President and another six years of a Duterte presidency has somewhat resurrected the issue of political dynasties. The Opposition, which seems to be operating solely on being an anti-Duterte entity, are sorely lacking on a political platform, and still indecisive about credible and capable candidates for both President and Vice President, suddenly revived talk about the “evil side” of political dynasties. It seems to be an act of desperation on the part of the opposition, hoping that badmouthing the Duterte father-and-daughter tandem will chip away support from Inday Sara and win the elections.
To make the pre-election drama more interesting, Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso also rode on the issue of political dynasties, seemingly doing an indirect swipe on Inday Sara during a recent television interview, where he said, “Di ako boboto ng magmamana lang ng puwesto. Di ako naniniwala na ang pwesto sa gobyerno, lalo na ang pinakamataas na pwesto, ang qualification ay dapat anak ka ni ganito, anak ka ni ganyan. I will not vote for that person whoever they are.”
Frankly speaking, there is really nothing bad with political dynasties, in general. In fact, they have been around for a long time and present in many countries. Contemporary political dynasties include the Bushes, Kennedys and Clintons of the United States; the Abes of Japan; the Lees of Singapore; the Parks of South Korea; and the Kirchners of Argentina. Philippine politics have been dominated by political dynasties as well. Most political dynasties are concentrated on local politics, holding key positions in the provincial and city or municipal levels. There are also political dynasties that both have national and local political presence.
Patronage politics and a political system that imposes term limits on all elective positions are the two primary reasons for the existence of political dynasties in the Philippines. Political families thrive on patronage politics in order to gain support and votes from their constituents, and maintain their hegemony over the locality where they have been in power for years. The politician and members of his family attend to every need of their constituents, including being present during “KBL” (Kasal, Binyag at Libing; i.e., weddings, baptisms and funerals), paying for medical expenses and utility bills, and giving gifts and relief goods during the holidays. With “utang na loob” being strong among Filipinos, the constituents continuously vote for members of the same political family every election, effectively cementing the political family’s control over the locality and their constituents, and shutting down all possible challengers and threats to their dominance.
The prevailing political system in the Philippines, more specifically term limits, encourages the existence of political families. The term limits are a single six-year term for the President; two consecutive six-year terms for the Vice President and the senators; and three consecutive three-year terms for local politicians, such as congressmen, governors, vice governors, members of the provincial board, mayors, vice mayors, and members of the city or municipal council. In order to ensure continuity, whether intentionally by the political family or unintentionally as a result of the choice of voters during elections, the incumbent politicians, especially those at the local level, field family members such as their spouses, siblings and children to replace them upon reaching their term limit, with them either seeking other elective positions or taking a break of up to three years before returning to their old post.
Instead of generalizing all of them as bad, political dynasties should be divided into good political dynasties and bad political dynasties. Good political dynasties are those that get things done and deliver good results to their constituents, resulting in an improvement of the quality of life for the constituents, and an improvement in the economy and peace and order situation of the locality, ultimately leading to members of the same political family being elected into office by their constituents during the elections. On the other hand, bad political dynasties are those that have members of the same political family occupying the same elective seats for years but have not delivered good results to their constituents and caused significant changes in the quality of life of their constituents or the economic standing and peace and order situation of their locality.
Whether we admit it or not, the Dutertes are a political dynasty. After all, they have been in control of Davao City Hall since the now-President Rodrigo Duterte became Mayor in the mid-1980’s. However, why is it that the messaging of the political opposition about the perils of electing members of the Duterte family at the local elective positions in Davao City, and even the possibility Inday Sara and even her father being elected into the two highest positions of the land due to “bad side” of the political dynasty? Could it be because the Dutertes form a good political dynasty, one that delivered good results, and improved the lives of their constituents and quality of life in their locality, both in Davao City, and, when Rodrigo Duterte was elected President, the Philippines?
Before the political opposition paints a picture of the Dutertes as a bad political dynasty, they should first look into the mirror. The Cojuangco-Aquino clan, Araneta-Roxas clan, Robredos, Lagmans, etc. are all political dynasties that are now, more or less, identified with the opposition. If all political dynasties are, according to the opposition, bad, then the opposition itself is bad because it is primarily buoyed by political dynasties that want to regain control of the Philippines from their rivals, unless, of course, it puts a blind eye on the topic of political dynasties when the table has been turned on them.
Political patronage in Philippine politics is cultural in nature, making it hard to change due to it being a product of hundreds of years of practice and eventual acceptance as the norm by the majority of Filipinos from all socio-economic classes. However, the removal of term limits in all national and local elective offices is the more feasible solution to “ending” political dynasties, as good politicians will be given the opportunity to serve their constituents for a longer period of time while their family members and political allies can focus on something else to do instead of eyeing the same political positions or thinking of ousting their incumbent relative or ally to establish their own dynasty. Remember that political dynasties are products of the choices of voters, and it is up to them if they are going to keep on voting for the members of the same political family or they are opting for new blood to lead them and their locality towards a different direction.",Politics
Members of @1Sambayan and the broader Opposition need to reflect on why Filipinos hate them,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/members-of-1sambayan-and-the-broader-opposition-need-to-reflect-on-why-filipinos-hate-them/,"It is clear that the most influential “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition still fail to truly understand why they are in the predicament they are today. With just a week to go until the much-hyped June 12 announcement of the candidates 1Sambayan will be endorsing and just 11 months to go before the election itself, neither a semblance of a campaign platform nor any indication of strong leadership has emerged from their camp.
The problem with members of the Opposition is that they continue to refuse to take personal accountability for the pathetic state of their “movement”. Perhaps they are too comfy in their self-appointed role as the “good guys” in an obsolete “fight” narrative of their own making. That’s all thanks to years of locking themselves up in their echo chambers where they exchange high fives amongst themselves whenever one of their lame hashtags “trend” on social media. The years of assuring one another that they are the “victims” — of “trolls”, of “fake news”, of “well-oiled propaganda machines”, etcetera etcetera — and that the “decency” they represent is under attack by “sinister forces” had devalued their narrative because they had all but trivialised the notions of “decent” and “civil” society and turned these into fodder for their dishonest ideologies.
Worse, they use Filipino voters as scapegoats for their failing bid to seize power legally in 2022, denigrating them as bobo (“idiots”), suggesting that the Opposition camp offers a choice that only “smart” people can grasp.
It is clear to most — perhaps with the exception of “thought leaders” of the Opposition — that many Filipinos are now put off by the schoolyard elitism exhibited by many personalities within the Opposition, particularly members of the Yellowtard bloc (the group of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan). It does not seem to occur to them that a review and re-think of this ineffective approach of insulting people in order to convert them is long overdue.
That brings us to the challenge of converting voters that the Yellowtards have so far proven to be so inept at. The whole point of an election campaign, after all, is to reach out to the unconverted and not to preach to the choir. 1Sambayan is foolishly using that proverbial choir as a source of insight to aid their process of deciding who to field as their endorsed candidates for the 2022 elections. Same approach will likely yield the same results — for them.
It is easy to see that the personalities they cast into their roadshow narrative makes them come across like an egg — white on the outside, yellow on the inside. Thus Filipinos will continue to see 1Sambayan for what it is: Yellowtard rebranded.
It’s high time someone from the Opposition come up with something original that could recapture the imagination of Filipinos considering alternatives. They will certainly not go for the moronism of communism and are plain and simple tired of Yellowtardism and the lame attempts to disguise that affliction using other colours. Those two ideologies are, at their core, ideologies of butthurt. Communism is all butthurt about capitalist “oppression” and the Yellowtards are butthurt about, wait for it, “The Martial Law Years”. It’s time to move on. Communism and Yellowtardism need to be ditched in favour of something that looks to the future. 1Sambayan is clearly not up to that job of providing Filipinos an intelligent option.",Politics
1Sambayan fails to measure up to opposition camps of previous elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/1sambayan-fails-to-measure-up-to-opposition-camps-of-previous-elections/,"Political scientists should be objective and pragmatic. If you dump both and pick a side, then you’re not a scientist anymore because your analysis is not based on evidence. A breath of fresh air is Cleve V Arguelles’s East Asia Forum piece “Can a new Philippine ‘popular front’ defeat Dutertismo?” where he ponders the question of whether or not Opposition bloc 1Sambayan is up to the challenge of building a “popular front” that could take on the formidable popularity of the incumbent camp.
Arquelles, Assistant Professorial Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at De La Salle University, provides an assesment of the prospects of the Opposition in light of that question citing the impact to ordinary Filipinos the crisis caused by the pandemic has had as an opportunity the Opposition could exploit. Arguelles, however, notes that 1Sambayan is problematic on many fronts…
The movement is primarily made up of the old guard in the respective groups — well-regarded but possibly out of touch with the Duterte public. To some the coalition’s messaging is overly moralistic and elitist. Its slogan ‘Tapat Na Pamumuno’ (Honest Leadership) resembles the lacklustre Liberal Party’s ‘Disenteng Pilipino’ (Decent Filipino) in 2016 and the previous administration’s slogan of ‘Daang Matuwid’ (Straight Path).
In the end, Arguelles reserves his prognosis writing that “the opposition can only hope that Filipinos see Dutertismo as a more costly choice in 2022.”
Why is it that the Opposition today can’t even come close to the opposition in the time of Presidents Fidel Ramos through to Noynoy Aquino? The simple answer is they do not have the narrative to attract the public to their cause. It was Ramos who ended the battle between leftists and rightists which was an offshoot of how Cory Aquino came to power in 1986. It wasn’t a “revolution” as they would like to believe. It was a coup d’etat. After 1992, both brought their causes before the voters. Both won elective offices in local government units and Congress.
The sorry state of the Opposition now is firstly due to the fact that its leaders abandoned them. Aquino and 2016 presidential candidate Mar Roxas are both under the radar. Why? They couldn’t handle the ignominious public repudiation they suffered in 2016. To describe President Rodrigo Duterte as a populist is incorrect because, in the Philippine context, what politician is not a populist? This is why there is the term popular vote.
The second reason is in how the Opposition comports themselves. It is not a fiscalizer role they’re playing but more of destablization one. This was the formula they employed against former Presidents Ferdinand Marcos, Joseph “Erap” Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). They failed with GMA though. Arroyo made sure the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) wouldn’t abandon her. EDSA 3, a small uprising that shortly followed the EDSA 2 coup that ousted Erap and catapulted GMA to power in 2001, didn’t take off but after this the then opposition settled down and took their case to the people again.
When Noynoy won in 2010 there were no claims of electoral fraud. There was no impeachment. No coup attempt even if the public was discontent with Aquino’s incompetence. The opposition defeat in the 2019 midterm was a wake-up call which they didn’t heed again. They have core adherents but no real voter base to count on. Imagine how the Vice-President, Leni Robredo, managed an inanity of an opinion that the reason for their 2019 loss was due to the youth either not registering to vote or did not vote. This is stupidity of the highest order.
It’s only a week before 1Sambayan’s candidates’ coming out event on June 12. At this point, even a glimmer of hope is not on the horizon for the Opposition. Robredo should be taking the lead as titular head but she is bereft of leadership. Senator Franklin Drilon is the only top official of the Liberal Party with the experience but he is also on the sidelines. The convenors of 1Sambayan have never run for elective office. What can the public expect on June 12? Nothing.",Politics
Meeting between Marcos and Arroyo camps has chilling effect on Yellowtards and Reds!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/meeting-between-marcos-and-arroyo-camps-has-chilling-effect-on-yellowtards-and-reds/,"Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) will always be a kingmaker in Philippine politics. Why? Because she has gravitas. It took balls to oust President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2001. It took even more balls to run again in 2004 despite the agreement with Cory that she would only serve the unexpired term of Estrada. She is the least popular President of all time.
We are all familiar with her story. Arroyo took the dose of political vengeance given to her better than a man because she kept silent the whole time she was in detention at Veterans. She is unlike Leila De Lima who has been made out to be a martyr and is not being held incommunicado. She only criticized former President Noynoy Aquino once. She played a large role in the campaign of President Rodrigo Duterte. When she was assumed to be quietly retiring during her last term as Congresswoman, she pulled a coup against the incumbent Speaker and went off being a part of a small circle of elected officials who have headed two branches of government.
A meeting between the Marcos and GMA camps is significant because of the President’s statement the other day that Martin Romualdez wants to run for Vice-President. It is not entirely up to the President who his anointed will be because the power blocs that supported him since 2016 all have a say. Arroyo will definitely be abhorred at the prospect of a Ping Lacson Presidency. She would definitely have a personal opinion about who will continue the reforms which have been started. As an economist she surely has ideas about how the country can be set on the path to economic recovery in the midst of the pandemic.
If Inday Sara “Daughterte” is not running, then former Senator Bongbong Marcos would be the logical candidate. But there is also the possibility of a Duterte-Romualdez tandem because of the dearth of administration candidates for the Senate. Can you imagine a Senate where the two most senior members would be Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid? Senators Ralph Recto, Tito Sotto and Franklin Drilon are termed out. Lacson is eligible for re-election but indicated it is retirement or the Presidency for him.
Bongbong could follow in the footsteps of his father Apo Lakay and become Senate President. A majority is needed in both chambers if charter change is to become a reality. GMA can run for Congress again and become Speaker. If the political structure is changed to a unicameral parliamentary with a Prime Minister as head of state then GMA, Bongbong, and Sara can all run for parliament and we would finally have the continuity and consistency in policy foreign investors have long been pining for.
It is high-time that political vendetta take a back seat. It is only the Yellows and the Reds who refuse to be mature enough to work with the different political blocs. I have reiterated in previous articles the need for a mature and responsible opposition that will focus on being a fiscalizer and function as a partner also in nation-building.
Aquino and Marcos are long dead and buried. We should finally do away with their political ghosts. We should also bury the old opposition with finality on May 2022. Only then can we truly move forward at this crucial point when we are facing a global crisis of epic proportions.",Politics
Manny Pacquiao at loggerheads with PDP-Laban leadership over 2022 bid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/manny-pacquiao-at-loggerheads-with-pdp-laban-leadership-over-2022-bid/,"Someone please remind boxer-turned-senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao that politics is addition. PDP-Laban executive director Ron Munsayac’s claim that there are 100,000 card-carrying members of the PDP-Laban may be true for now. But these hundred thousand will not side in their favor for the simple reason the power and the money are still with the administration. Pacquiao’s move to boycott a party meeting called by party chairman Alfonso Cusi was foolish at best.
Pacquiao’s call for a boycott of the meeting is seen as his way of throwing down the gauntlet at Cusi, who represents a faction in PDP-Laban made up of Duterte loyalists.
Pacquiao, the party’s president, had long felt alienated by the Cusi group, who is trying to convince Duterte to run for vice president in the 2022 elections.
President Rodrigo Duterte is still the Chair of the party. He is the titular head and isn’t a lame duck despite the imagination of Koko Pimentel and Munsayac. Even Pac-Man with his billions can’t afford a Presidential run on his own. He can win reelection to the Senate but not as President.
On second thought, this might just be a ploy by Koko to obtain concessions from Duterte. Koko has been marginalized since his ouster as Senate President. He was removed because he was hewing more to the Opposition, rather than the administration line. PDP-Laban has been, since its inception, Yellow to the core. Pac-Man won a Senate seat under former Vice President Jejomar Binay’s United Nationalist Alliance (UNA). He was endorsed by then candidate Duterte who couldn’t form his own slate. Pac-Man may have been a shoo-in but no doubt the endorsement helped him land the seat.
Both the administration and Opposition benches have a shallow talent pool for their respective Senate slates. The prospect of Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid as the elder Senators after this election cycle should be enough to scare the public into finally considering a unicameral parliamentary system and abolish the upper chamber.
Pac-Man should know better because it’s not rocket science that is in front of him. Simple logic suffices. Even Koko shows his lack of political skills by foisting Pacquiao on the public. Pimentel can’t even win a local post in his hometown of Cagayan De Oro. If he’s looking to become Pac-Man’s running mate, that’s also an unviable proposition. Pac-Man should come to his senses before it is too late.",Politics
Can Ping Lacson transform senatorial votes into presidential? Perhaps with Pacman’s and Isko’s help…,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/can-ping-lacson-transform-senatorial-votes-into-presidential-perhaps-with-pacmans-and-iskos-help/,"Lito Banayo’s Manila Standard piece today “The Vice President” is basically a stocktake of the circus that has come to town. The one confronting thing he points out is the elephant in the Opposition room — that speculation around whether or not Vice President Leni Robredo will seek the presidency in 2022 drags on. “No one has come around volunteering to be her team-mate, at least not publicly,” Banayo laments.
The other interesting pseudo-fact is Banayo’s claim that boxer-turned-senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao has met with Senator Ping Lacson about a possible team-up which has Pacquiao as the VP…
On the “independent” side of the political aisle, what used to be “cast in stone”, the partnership between Senator Ping Lacson for president and Senate President Tito Sotto as his vice-presidential team-mate seems to have foundered on the shoals of uncertainty.  Of late, the Pacman team has reached out to the senate president, and supposedly with the presence of Senator Ping, toyed with the idea of running as the determined Pacman’s vice-president.
Sources also confirm that the camps of Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and Lacson met but couldn’t come to an agreement because both wanted to be President. Lacson has the experience and seniority while Isko has the numbers this early in the game. Pac-Man provides Ping with the masa support if ever.
Lacson’s stern image plus his metrosexual looks doesn’t register well with the masa. His biggest problem is translating his Senatorial votes into Presidential votes. In his 2004 run, Lacson only managed to get 10% of the vote. Last Friday’s shocker was the photo released of the Marcos and Romualdez tête-à-tête with former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). This came on the heels of a Presidential statement that he has promised the VP post to Leyte Congressman Martin Romualdez. Whether that is related to his deferring to the President in regard to the Speakership tussle last year wasn’t mentioned.
The week before that it was Inday Sara “Daughterte” who was in Manila for unspecified reasons. But she had merienda cena with Senadora Imee Marcos at her residence further fuelling speculation about her running and which running mate she would choose. This left the Opposition’s collective head spinning like a trumpo. The confirmation that they are in total disarray has given the upper hand to the administration.
From the latest developments, we might have a three-way race between the administration, a possible Lacson-Pacman ticket, Isko-TBA (runningmate) to be announced and probably the Opposition with a Robredo-Trillanes combine. But one source who was Isko’s classmate at the Manila City Council said last Tuesday, “si Isko nagtatapos yan ng term”. But when it was suggested that he was being egged on by his Chief of Staff and close adviser Letlet Zarcal, the source said “nakikinig din yan sa ganyan pag kinargahan”.
And so the political rigodon continues. Banayo could be floating red herrings about Lacson-Pacman because he is supposed to be Isko’s designated campaign manager. But until such time there is a formal announcement from each of the personalities involved, nothing is cast in stone. The oligarchs are definitely moving their chess pieces in the political game of thrones. One has to look at the pawns and how they’re moving in relation to the business interests of each oligarch. In the meantime, the opposition’s heads spin and they continue to run around like a headless chicken. That’s entertainment.",Politics
Opposition will have to ditch its FAKERY to beat “Dutertismo” in 2022,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/opposition-will-have-to-ditch-its-fakery-to-beat-dutertismo-in-2022/,"Dutertismo. Coined by Randy David. Preached by Richard Heydarian. What is it exactly? The proper definition would be Duterte being Duterte. David, in his Inquirer piece “The opposition’s dilemma” today characterizes it as politically dysfunctional decision-making with policy thrown out the window. He writes…
Dutertismo is primarily defined by its open disregard of a society’s institutional guardrails, especially of the checks to executive prerogative. It is impulsive, relying mostly on gut feel, and has no patience for careful study of crucial questions. Its gauge of policy effectiveness is the shock value it creates and the fear it induces in its intended targets. It has no need for periodic assessment of policy outcomes. It is more concerned with impression management than on the production of enduring social change. It does not hide its preference for direct authoritarian means over the slow deliberative procedures of a democratic system.
David stops short of describing it as President Rodrigo Duterte acting like a Mayor in running the country. But isn’t that exactly it?
The Opposition was caught flat-footed in the 2016 election by Duterte. The groundwork had been laid for a Mar Roxas coronation. A Jejomar Binay – Joseph “Erap” Estrada ticket was in the offing for the opposition then but then President Noynoy Aquino and Roxas made sure that that will not happen. A demolition job was launched against Binay. Jinggoy Estrada was detained along with Bong Revilla and Juan Ponce Enrile. If Duterte hadn’t run, Roxas would be President.
Five years hence the Opposition still hasn’t gained any ground against Duterte. They thought COVID-19 was their silver bullet but alas they weren’t successful in pulling a Trump on him. Despite the pandemic, Duterte’s approval and trust numbers have held. The Opposition has been left leaderless as both Aquino and Roxas have shunned the limelight. Roxas’ loss in 2019 was the demise of his political career. Three runs for national office all resulting in a loss. Not one Opposition “thought leader” has dared to point out what is wrong in their camp. They are unworthy of being labeled “The Opposition” because they have done nothing at all in terms of providing the public with an alternative to the administration. Not any one of the “elder statesmen” have risen to the occasion. It’s has been argumentum ad hominem ad infinitum against Duterte since he won on May 9, 2016.
This is why they are the laughingstock of the public. They provide entertainment and nothing more. The 1Sambayan launch last June 12 proved this when four of the six candidates they named for President and Vice-President declined to participate in their selection process. This left them with the Catwoman and Batman tandem of vice president Leni Robredo and former senator Antonio Trillanes.
Interesting then that David now gives this bit of advise to his pals…
The opposition must patiently explain what is wrong with this [government’s] form of governance, how it has brought the country to the dire situation it is in, and why we urgently need a different kind of leader. This is different from merely demonizing a political enemy.
David speaks of policy formulation when the Opposition can’t even present the public with a platform of government. Robredo’s “achievements” are all PR snow jobs which aren’t scaleable enough for them to be institutionalized. She refuses to be part of the government despite her being the second highest official and acts as if she’s in a alternative parallel reality government where she is the President. The Opposition claim that Duterte is a narcissist and guilty of “gas lighting”. Read any material on narcissistic personality disorder and you will find out that narcissists use that defense when in truth and in fact, they are the narcissists. I would go to the extent of labeling them political narcissists because they are all image and no substance. It is all about faking it until making it. Eerily very similar to “it doesn’t necessarily have to be true but just look as if it is true.”
Fakery will not get the opposition anywhere as it has been proven by the early surveys for the Presidency where the top choice is Inday Sara “Daughterte”. It is also typical of narcissists to put the blame on others rather than admit to their shortcomings. This is why every loss they experience is blamed on what they call the bobotantes. Worse, Leni Robredo claimed about three weeks ago that they had the support of the youth but most them weren’t registered to vote.
Narcissists generally have nowhere to go but down. There is no cure for what ails them. They are emotional bullies which explains the love of the Yellowidiots for necropolitics. They prey on the emotions of normal people. They portray themselves as either The Victim or The Good who is out to triumph over The Evil. I leave you with the image of Dinky Soliman as proof that this is exactly what will happen to them sooner than we expect.",Politics
Philippine Opposition partisans remain stupid about political history because of idiots like Bart Guingona,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/philippine-opposition-partisans-remain-stupid-about-political-history-because-of-idiots-like-bart-guingona/,"The Philippine Opposition remain as stupid as they are this late into this election cycle because of all the wannabe artistahin “influencers” and “thought leaders” their partisans habitually tingala to. Thank the scars of our colonial past for that. Seeing this recent tweet of his, it becomes hard to really understand which planet Yellowidiot Bart Guingona lives on, for example.
What I do know is, I myself was a Yellowidiot from 1983 – 1987. The minute the 1987 Constitution was finished by the Constitutional Commission, however, I was done being one. There was some hope in the Fidel Ramos administration but the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program and the PEA-Amari scam (Public Estate Authority joint project with  Thailand-based development group Amari Coastal Development Corporation) dimmed that hope.
Following that, I knew from the onset that then President Joseph “Erap” Estrada wouldn’t finish his term. He was an outsider and had little experience wielding the levers of power. Erap needed a good and trustworthy adviser. But he had none. I didn’t like how Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) succeeded Erap but when she survived that coup attempt of sorts with the resignation of the Hyatt 10, she gained my respect. That increased after the 2008 financial crisis which barely affected the country. She put into place fiscal legislation which strengthened the economy even if highly unpopular and at a large cost to her political capital.
I wanted Erap to win in 2010 if only for him to be vindicated. Erap was offered exile but he didn’t accept it. He chose to make a stand. He may not have been detained at Muntinlupa but we now have a better idea of what house arrest means since the onset of the pandemic. I knew Noynoy Aquino was going to be a fuck-up but he was a shoo-in after former President Cory Aquino died. Either he got enough votes or the justification for fraud was there. Why? Look at how Erap came in second in that crowded field when he had to go up against Manny Villar with all his money.
I didn’t think Rodrigo Duterte would actually run to begin with. Having had four encounters with the man when he was Davao Mayor in the 90s, he wasn’t Presidential material but he wasn’t as stupid as he projected himself to be. His Matina “clubhouse,” where he held office, was filled with books. Duterte loved wine, women and song at that time, but he is also a voracious and wide reader. It’s reflected in his vocabulary when he speaks. In five years he has done what he could. It is not enough and his administration isn’t perfect but I don’t think for a moment that he has fallen short on what he could deliver under the circumstances. Noynoy’s flagship program were the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects but these did not have a palpable impact on the lives of the average Pinoy. Duterte will finish his term with infrastructure projects completed from Luzon to Mindanao. His legislative agenda hangs in the balance as there is still pending economic reform bills pending in Congress. He is rushing what he can get passed before June 30, 2022.
The Opposition should stop with their black propaganda and their obsolete appeal to emotions. They should be doing the hard work of developing an alternative platform of government to present to the people for the 2022 election. Instead of the vicious politicking since 2016, they should have taken their role of fiscalizer maturely and responsibly for the people they are supposed to serve. Gaslighting worked to their advantage during the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos and Erap. But it won’t now. The public has seen through their duplicity with their dumping GMA when they had a falling out. Noynoy’s being an idiot President was the last straw. That was the last time an appeal to emotion worked in their favor.
We need a mature and responsible opposition playing the fiscalizer role helping the government in nation-building. We don’t need an opposition who will focus on shortcuts to get back power through destablization and impeachment. This is why the national artist for literature, F. Sionil Jose, said that Duterte may yet be the greatest President after Magsaysay. History is not yet done with Rodrigo Duterte. But it is done with the Yellowidiots.",Politics
Aiko Melendez Kakalabanin Si Ate Rose Nono Lin Sa QC 5th District?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/aiko-melendez-kakalabanin-si-ate-rose-nono-lin-sa-qc-5th-district/,"Tila bigla-bigla na lang na nag-accounce si Ms. Aiko Melendez na babalik siya sa politika either as a candidate for Councilor or Congresswoman sa District 5. Nagulantang tuloy ang isa pang nag-aambisyon na maging councilor o congresswoman rin na si Ate Grace Nono Lin na mukhang malaki na rin ang naipuhunan sa maagang pangangampanya para sa mga naturang pwesto.
Bagamat matagal-tagal na rin na wala sa politika si Ms. Melendez, malakas pa rin ang recall ng pangalan niya sa usapang politika ng Quezon City. Isa itong three term councilor ng 2nd District ng Quezon City at tumakbo na bilang Vice Mayor na katuwang ni Mike Defensor nuong 2010.
Hindi man siya pinalad na maging Vice Mayor dahil natalo siya ng anak ni dating Mayor Sonny Belmonte na si Joy, eventually naging girlfriend naman siya ni Zambales Vice Governor Jay Khonghun.
Bilang councilor ng 2nd District ng Quezon City noon, naipagmayabang nito na in her three terms or nine years sa posisyon, DALAWANG multi-purpose hall ayon sa isang dating interview niya sa PEP.
“Ako, maipagmamalaki ko na may proyekto ako. Magugulat kayo na sa liit ng budget ko na yun, may multi-purppose hall ka na dalawa na pinapagawa and to think na ang district ko is the biggest in Quezon City… Hindi naman ako si Superman na magagawa ko lahat ng problema nila. But sa akin, I see to it that I do my job.”
Nasabi niya ito bilang pagsagot sa “biro” ng noo’y kandidato pa lamang sa pagka mayor na si Herbert Bautista. Nasabi diumano ni Herbert na “tamad” at “walang nagawa” si Ms. Melendez.
Hindi lang si Herbert ang pinuntirya ni Ms. Melendez, pati ang anak ni dating mayor Sonny Belmonte na si Joy eh tila nasabuyan rin niya ng maanghang na salita sa interview niya noon sa PEP.
Hindi ikinaila ni Aiko ang kanyang disgusto nang malaman niyang tatakbo bilang running mate ni Bistek si Joy Belmonte-Alimurung.
Ayon kay Aiko, kulang pa sa karanasan ang anak ni Quezon City Mayor Francisco “Sonny” Belmonte, habang siya ay three-term councilor na at kumuha pa ng crash course on Legislation sa University of the Philippines at kung paano maging isang mabuting vice mayor.
“Ako, wala kayong maririnig sa akin na bad about Mayor Belmonte because he has done so much for Quezon City. Siya ang isang rason kung bakit napaangat ang antas ng Quezon City. Tatay ang tingin ko kay Mayor Belmonte. Kaya lang, nung nag-usap nga kami nitong ano, last week, ang sabi niya sa akin, ‘I’m sorry.’
“Sabi ko sa kanya, ‘Sir, you don’t have to say sorry, Mayor. Kasi alam naman ninyo po na 2003 pa lang tumimbre na ako sa inyo. Sabi ninyo mag-Congress na ako nung nag-aaway kayo ng isang pulitiko. Sabi ko, hindi na. Ibigay ninyo na lang sa iba dahil ang gusto ko po maging vice mayor. Gusto ko po tapusin kasi itong Council.’ It’s legislative ‘yan, e. Yung nagpe-preside ka. Eto yung I love debating. I love questioning…
“Parang nagsabong kaming ‘dalawang’ anak niya. Ang problema lang ang paborito niyang anak si Joy, ako yung ‘anak sa labas.’ So sabi ko, ‘Mayor, with due respect, wala kayong maririnig sa akin na paninira kung ano ang ginawa ninyo. Ang punto ko lang is, ang pinanghahawakan ko is my experience.’
“Si Joy Belmonte-Alimurung, hindi siya tumapak ni sa Council, out of nowhere. It just so happens na anak siya ni Mayor Sonny,” madiing sinabi ni Aiko.
“Hindi lang ako yung accidental candidate na, ‘Ah, anak kita, halika ka, takbo ka dito.’ Tinapos ko ang termino ko, e. At saka tumimbre ako sa inyo na tatakbo akong vice mayor.

Necropolitics Card dealt by God to the Yellowtards!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/necropolitics-card-dealt-by-god-to-the-yellowtards/,"Breaking News according to the Tribune, albeit a “developing story”… “Various sources have claimed that former Benigno Simeon “Noynoy” Aquino III died this morning at the Capitol Medal Center.” Possible game changer? Is this the Silver Bullet the Yellowtards have been scrounging around for? Recall back in 2009 how Noynoy Aquino was catapulted to the Liberal Party presidential candidacy and went on for the win all but dashing Mar Roxas’s presidential hopes forevah. With the Yellowtard-led Opposition in disarray and the failure of top Opposition coalition 1Sambayan to distance itself from the poisonous yellow stain, perhaps this development is a godsend for Antonio Carpio and Manny Pangilinan and their henchmen’s vision of natural gas billions!
The question in many people’s minds as this goes to press is whether Aquino’s, a.k.a. PNoy’s, legacy and the card his death “blesses” the Opposition with is potent enough to move public sentiment significantly enough to change the 2022 election landscape. Most observers don’t think so. It is widely-recognised that the Second Aquino Administration is singularly accountable for the demise of the Yellow brand. The performance of the PNoy administration is also seen to be the single biggest contributor to the wholesale discrediting of the Yellowtard narrative that had put up Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr and Cory Aquino on pedestals reserved for “martyred” national heroes.
What timing, indeed. An Aquino death in an election year. Both admin and Opposition politicians will have to tread carefully in their regard for the passing of a Philippine president. Yellowtardom had made grievous mistakes framing entire political platforms around messaging hostile to the incumbent administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Administration blocs gunning for continuity post 2022 should practice what they preach. Senate President Tito Sotto issues some wise words consistent to this: “No matter what political side you’re on when a former president passes away, the country mourns.”
Owing to the lateness of the hour, it is likely, nonetheless, that Opposition PR and campaign managers will be scrambling to develop a game plan given this development. Given the challenging situation presented by the pandemic, massive funeral parades and “multi-faith” commemoration rallies on EDSA are out of the question (or at least as far as legal avenues for these are concerned). Unfortunately for them, the Yellowtards are currently deprived of the traditional tools they use to make things like this a big deal. With ABS-CBN out of commission, the fat pipeline through which acoustic ballads of mourning can be pumped into the homes of millions of analog Filipinos is just not there. There is only Facebook for the hoi polloi and Twitter for the chi chi. Social media and PR “experts” will have to think outside of the square.
Whatever the case, the race to weaponise the death of former Philippine President Noynoy Aquino is on. Even in the best of times the Yellowtards were never above doing whatever it takes. Specially in these days when push is coming to shove, all cards will be at play. In 1983, Ninoy died. Three years later, his wife Cory was president. In 2009 Cory died. Her son Noynoy stepped on Roxas’s head to become President in 2010. 2021 and Noynoy Aquino is dead. Who becomes President in 2022? Will Noynoy be the man who will finally interrupt the Yellowtards’ tradition of necropolitics?

5-way presidential race emerging: Opposition under huge pressure to come up with disruptive but SMART platforms,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/5-way-presidential-race-emerging-opposition-under-huge-pressure-to-come-up-with-disruptive-but-smart-platforms/,"In his piece “The Marcos maneuver”, Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) indulges himself with a bit of wishful thinking, hoping that the formidable administration coalition would break up and the Opposition taking back power in 2022.
What Ferdinand Martin Romualdez could not say about Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. is that the former senator has his sights on the presidency, which makes it a problem for the whole Duterte-Marcos-Romualdez-Arroyo Axis. Even if allies peel away to fulfill their own ambitions—as Lacson and Sotto and others are already starting to do — the core coalitionists have to hold together.
For some reason, it seems the President isn’t keen on Ferdinand Jr. for veep; but is Ferdinand Jr. himself keen on being veep? The President can easily say the only person he trusts to have his back is his daughter as the next president. Which means Ferdinand Jr., and not Manny Pacquiao, is the real problem of the ruling coalition.
Actually, the worst case scenario is Bongbong Marcos, Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao, and Inday Sara “Daughterte” runs. That’s three plus The tandems of Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto, Leni Robredo – Antonio Trillanes (?), and Isko Moreno – Grace Poe (?), it becomes a five-way race. That was the same situation in 2016. Duterte won that election. Quezon is hoping that Robredo can “sneak” in the way she did in 2016. That time Robredo had the whole of government behind her with five other candidates as the source of votes for “SmartMagic”. As one of my more stoic friends put it, the Yellows created a monster in SmartMagic and now they can’t control it. But does MLQ3 think that Duterte and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) are both stupid? Bongbong? The President only projects an air of stupidity but he is not. That country bumpkin image is very deceiving. The opposition actually fell for it in 2016.
If Sara actually does not want to run, then doesn’t MLQ3 think that a Marcos-Duterte ticket is possible? I’m talking about Rodrigo not Sara. Pac-Man bolts the PDP-Laban and joins the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) of Sotto. Will Sotto not run for VP and give it to Pac-Man and become campaign manager instead? Eminent political strategist Malou Tiquia has noted the drop-off in the middle; the decreased support among the pro-administration and anti-administration bases. Lacson can appeal to that middle if he comes up with the correct messaging which makes it a head-to-head battle between the two tickets. Not political enemies but two versions of the same  political leaning. But to my mind, any Presidential candidate who will challenge the Duterte brand needs to be as disruptive as Duterte was in 2016 if he wants to have a strong chance of success.
The 2022 election is not exactly the same song-and-dance contest we’ve been having in the past. People are anxious and wary about and of the future. The only certainty is uncertainty. The inefficiency of the bureaucracy is made more evident by the pandemic. Inflation and unemployment is hitting them hard. The Opposition has obfuscated information about the vaccines to the point the people are confused. The local government units (LGUs) can’t get vaccination drives organized because they still refuse to adopt technology to make registration easier and the process orderly. What the people want to hear now are plans of action moving forward. This is not an ordinary election.
The next President should have a plan for his term in place even before the filing deadline in October. The Opposition should get its own house in order instead of constantly peeking at the neighbor’s on the other side of the fence. No other political party will coalesce with the Yellowidiots because they’re the kiss of death. They’re worse than COVID-19. They are dead men walking.",Politics
The chance to bury the Aquino legacy FOR GOOD is ripe for the picking — for politicians COURAGEOUS enough to go there,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-chance-to-bury-the-aquino-legacy-for-good-is-ripe-for-the-picking-for-politicians-courageous-enough-to-go-there/,"Non-administration allied politicians are in a conundrum. The deluge of messages related to the recent death of former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III is a mix of the expected responses from the bleeding-heart side and those that are, shall we say, a bit more circumspect with being too “generous” in their outpouring of grief. This is an election period after all and not a few politicians aspiring for lucrative seats in Congress and Malacanang are well aware of the fatal effects of being associated with the Yellow narrative of the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan. Indeed, considering that many would be hard-pressed to issue even a low-ball stock-take of the achievements of the Second Aquino Administration to prop up Noynoy’s legacy and considering that it is widely-known that he did not even want to be president to begin with, framing this development will be an interesting challenge for the handlers of this year’s crop of candidates.
Key to messaging decisions being debated behind closed doors in the campaign rooms and Viber chats of politicians’ staffers revolve around one singular metric: vote conversion. The stakes are high and campaign teams cannot afford to allow traditional emotionalism to get in the way of a lucid regard for what hard data is telling them. In this time of pandemic where the primary channel for reaching constituents is of the digital sort, politicians facing off with formidable incumbents need to be surgical.
If there is one thing that this generation of politicians must learn from the from-left-field win of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte 2016, it is that a leader must possess the conviction and courage to dive straight into no-go-zones and skewer sacred cows. Right here today is a sacred cow — the dead Noynoy Aquino that tradition dictates demands the respect the dead deserve — and the no-go-zone waiting for a politician to plant his or her flag upon and claim as his or her territory: burying the Aquino legacy for good. The politician who can claim that space will be the courageous one and is one who will likely reap the rewards of such audacity.
Indeed, it was audacity that catapulted Duterte to power in 2016. He had the audacity to thumb his nose at the sacred (albeit dying) cows of the time — the Yellow narrative, the Church, “human rights” BS, American Junk, etc. All through that, he remained open and unapologetic about his bugoy — even bastos — persona, going all out with his use of candid language when addressing the public and candid mannerisms when engaging with his people. Suffice to say, armies of political analysts (some fancying themselves “chief political analysts”) are burning the midnight oil figuring out how to replicate this stunning coup Duterte pulled in 2016. Well, for those who who are serious about replicating such a coup, the answer is staring them in the face today.
Shhhh… Can you hear it? It’s the deafening sound of silence about Noynoy’s death coming from the majority of non-admin-allied polticians. Why the silence? Because it is widely-recognised that being associated with the Yellow narrative of the Aquino clan is a death sentence to any aspiration for higher office in 2022. Silence will not cut it though — specially in this tough, deathly-competitive political environment. You need to go for the kill while the deer paralysed by fear is in your sights. Those camps that can muster the courage and audacity to exploit the singular opportunity that the death of The Last Political Aquino presents will make his or her mark in a race where stark brand differentiation will spell the difference between victory and defeat.",Politics
Senate composition post-2022 election key to crucial admin agendas – including Charter Change,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/senate-composition-post-2022-election-key-to-crucial-administration-legislative-agendas-including-charter-change/,"Self-described “Chief Political Analyst”. “CPA”. De La Salle University professor Antonio Contreras won’t even endorse former Senator Bongbong Marcos whom he fought hard for in 2016. Contreras was actually a Jojo Binay – Marcos cheerleader in that election cycle. Back then, he was a critical collaborator of Duterte he said while fully-embracing the label of “DDS” (“Duterte Die-hard Supporters”). We all know what happened to their group. It was bound to self-destruct given the vested interests of each “member.” Para sa Bayan turned out to be Para sa Bulsa at Posisyon. But that’s how politics works.
So now, Contreras writes this in his piece “Electoral possibilities” published on the Manila Times how “nothing stops me from imagining certain likely scenarios.” Of BBM, the “CPA” writes…
Having lost to Robredo, by virtue of the decision by the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Marcos will think hard before he risks another loss. The specter of losing twice in a row may be a strong motivation for him to take the safer path. But then again, things may change, and it may even be possible that Marcos could team up with a Duterte, whether Sara as president or even perhaps Digong as his vice, which will change the entire game completely.
I’m interested in the opinion of the “CPA” with regard to the Senatorial race. Twelve slots up for grabs. Whoever wins the most seats gets control of the legislative agenda. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) has the most number of “viable” candidates. Viable in the sense they are returnees after a short hiatus because of term limits. It remains to be seen if the NPC will remain with the administration. The minute a Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is officially announced the die is cast. No animosity on the same level as the Yellowidiots and we can be sure that if they win, they’d be willing to work with what may eventually become the new Opposition or another administration coalition. Such are the vagaries of Philippine politics. An NPC Senate bloc is Tito Sotto’s insurance policy against irrelevance in the event he isn’t elected Vice-President. It makes him a kingmaker in determining who becomes Senate President.
The administration also has a shallow bench in the Senatorial race. The NPC fielding a Lacson-Sotto tandem leaves the administration with only one re-electionist in Migs Zubiri. Richard Gordon is threatening to run for President again. More than likely he will go back to the Senate again — on which side is not known yet. Mark Villar will be on the administration slate for sure. Among the Cabinet members, Art Tugade, Teddyboy Locsin, Eduardo Año and Delfin Lorenzana are viable. This leaves the administration with six slots to fill. Add Bong Go, Bato dela Rosa, and Francis Tolentino and assuming the new faces all win, that only makes for a total of nine. Still short of the thirteen required for a simple majority and the 3/4 majority needed to amend the Constitution. This makes it all the more important for voters to know the stand of each of the Senatorial candidates on key issues. These will all play a huge factor in which direction the country takes after 2022.",Politics
Was Noynoy Aquino president of all Filipinos or president only of the Yellowtards? History will be the judge.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/was-noynoy-aquino-president-of-all-filipinos-or-president-only-of-the-yellowtards-history-will-be-the-judge/,"Urbanity and civility sounds better in Spanish – urbanidad y civilidad. Pinoys are by nature respectful of the dead. That’s why Noynoy Aquino became President in 2010. His partisans will tout his legacy and those who disdain him, his shortcomings. The biggest challenge for the Opposition now is in not using his death in the same manner his father’s and mother’s deaths were used to catapult his mother and himself to power.
You can be sure the Yellows will be out in full-force and the ribbon will be on full display in place of the flag which symbolizes the nation and its people. Aquino wasn’t the President of the Yellows alone. He was the President of the Republic of the Philippines. But it was evident that his patriotism was symbolized by the Yellow ribbon and not the flag. The potential candidates of the opposition will be out in full force to exploit the optics. It is in their best interest to do so. Heaven forbid that the Filipino has a relapse of 2010 and wax sentimental and emotional again because of the former president’s death.
The Opposition should once and for all refrain from the necropolitics. But like individuals affected with narcissistic personality disorder, this is their default compulsive behavior along with delusions and self-entitlement. They don’t see anything wrong wishing President Rodrigo Duterte dead but to call a spade a spade in one’s judgment of Aquino is blaspehemy. I still remember the comments made by the Opposition when former President Ferdinand Marcos was buried on November 2016. Marcos allowed Ninoy to go to the US for treatment of his heart condition but Cory couldn’t find it in her to allow Marcos back to be buried in his country.
Urbanidad y civilidad is supposed to be the default of those who come from the de buena familias. Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to be the case with them when it comes to their political rivals. It’s about time the Opposition heed the signs from the above that it is not up to anyone to wish one dead. It is only up to Him. We are thus left wondering: How can the Opposition behave so badly at a very inopportune time? It appears the only logical answer is because they can and they will.",Politics
Yellowtards’ behaviour following PNoy’s death reminds Filipinos why they SHOULD NOT vote for their candidates,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/yellowtards-behaviour-following-pnoys-death-reminds-filipinos-why-they-should-not-vote-for-their-candidates/,"The edification of Benigno C. Aquino III (PNoy) begins. My basic problem with the Yellowidiots is their holier-than-thou attitude and the hypocrisy that comes with it. I’ve experienced what it’s like to be gaslighted into believing that all of former President Ferdinand Marcos was bad. That was my political naiveté at its peak. But since 1987, I’ve become pragmatic.
I used to have the impression that the President was all-powerful that he can change the system by himself. My short stint at a local city university had reality slapping me in the face. Even at that level, it was difficult to institute reforms with the resistance you will encounter from an entenched bureaucracy which thrives on political patronage. Funny that. Here is “economist” Winnie Monsod’s exhibiting the very naiveté I ditched decades ago in her Inquirer piece today where she answers her own question, “How did PNoy fare?”…
President Arroyo, in her 10 years of presidency, succeeded in raising the value of the country’s gross domestic product (the market value of the final goods and services produced in the country in a specified period of time) by about P3.6 trillion (at 2018 prices). Population during that period increased by about 14 million.
President Aquino, in his six years of presidency, raised the value of GDP by P4.7 trillion, with the number of Filipinos increasing by about 10 million.
And finally, President Duterte during his 4.75 years in office, has raised the value of GDP by about P2 trillion, even as Filipinos have increased by 6 million.
This shows that Aquino fared better than his immediate predecessor, and it looks like he will fare better than the present regime.
Mareng Winnie and the rest of the Yellowidiots now want us to believe that PNoy did good during his term? It’s evident that he didn’t. Do we need to elaborate on what Noynoy did wrong? That’s like a broken CD already even if the reference is obsolete. The Establishment obviously does not like President Rodrigo Duterte for the simple reason that he’s an outsider. But this is also why he remains popular going into the sunset of his Presidency, which can’t be said of Aquino. If Noynoy did good, Mar Roxas should have won, despite Duterte. The worst case scenario was then Vice President Jejomar Binay prevailing despite the demolition job on him.
Corruption still exists. The same with drugs, but at a minimized level. Drastic in terms of the drug situation but less in corruption. It’s a fact of life that Western organizations concerned with advocacies about human rights and transparency in government tend to frown upon the likes of Duterte. He has been labeled as “populist” even if he is not. Duterte is not former US President Donald Trump or Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. He is nowhere near similar to China’s Xi Jinping or Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The reality is Noynoy was the accidental President. No one ever thought he would follow in Cory’s footsteps but he did. It was his mother who gave him the opportunity because her death was the missing piece of the puzzle in that election cycle. If Cory hadn’t died, Joseph “Erap” Estrada would’ve made history as the only President who won it twice.
The Yellows refuse to accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions. In truth and in fact, it was them who spawned Rodrigo Duterte by the act of removing elected public officials after they took power in 1986. It’s doubtful that Duterte’s late mother Nanay Soling asked for a reward for what she did for Cory in Davao. The fact that it was only the Vice-Mayorship offered speaks volumes about how they regarded the Duterte matriarch. But she didn’t complain. She was old and didn’t have the appetite for politics. She knew her boy could do good, one way or the other, in transforming their adopted home into a progressive regional hub.
The Yellows can edify Noynoy all they want. But the Filipino people and history are in the better position to judge. They made that known in 2016 and 2019. 2022 is the turning point in history again because it marks the end of the Aquinos in the country’s political firmament. The behavior of the Yellowidiots since Noynoy’s passing the other day just reminded Filipinos why they should not vote for the Aquino family’s candidates in 2022. Sadly for them, Noynoy’s death is also the death of that damned and blasted Yellow Ribbon.",Politics
Cut the Crap! PNoy’s Death was Not Heroic!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/cut-the-crap-pnoys-death-was-not-heroic/,"The floodgates have been opened for tributes and praises for former president Noynoy Aquino (PNoy) after the nation has heard about the former chief executive’s passing. These accolades mostly come from the members and ardent supporters of the Yellow persuasion. While there is nothing inherently wrong with paying respects to (and praying for the soul of) the departed it is one thing to express one’s admiration and sorrow, it is quite another to assert that PNoy was one of the best (if not the best) presidents our country has ever had. I definitely do not agree with that assertion. PNoy may have had a few traits that are worthy of admiration as an individual but to me his presidential legacy is mediocre at best. However, I do not intend to refute the Yellows’ assertions of how great PNoy and his presidency was. History is already replete with PNoy’s failures if we simply look at history without wearing Yellow lens. This writeup is about looking at how PNoy’s last days may have been and why it may be a mistake to project some sort of greatness and heroism on PNoy’s death. To resort to necropolitics once more in order for the Yellows to get back to power is actually doing PNoy a disservice.
I do not intend to dance on PNoy’s grave. I personally feel sorry for what he has been through. I actually know first-hand what PNoy went through when it comes to his End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes. I was diagnosed with the same affliction back in 2015 but I was fortunate to survive a kidney transplant procedure six months after my diagnosis. I also underwent a delicate heart procedure (angioplasty) just like PNoy before the transplant to ensure that my heart is well enough for the renal graft procedure. I know how hard PNoy’s ordeal must have been for him. There have been reports that PNoy skipped his last two dialysis sessions and for someone with ESRD, depending on the person’s condition, this could really spell trouble. To make matters worse, PNoy reportedly even asked his cook to make him Crispy Pata and Sisig the night before he passed away. I’m sure he has been informed that ESRD patients have to limit (or even avoid) protein consumption. During my ESRD days even one small bite of meat makes my creatinine levels rise up. Consuming meat without having undergone dialysis certainly will do a number on one’s blood toxicity. Going back to my case, after my diagnosis I refused to have dialysis. I chose to simply go on a strict diet and to follow a prescription regimen. That was very risky and in hindsight, it may have been a poor choice on my part. For six months I made myself endure astronomical creatinine levels which translated to having very toxic blood. I felt very weak and nauseous all the time. There were days when I just couldn’t get up from my bed because I just felt tired and weak. It was a lousy feeling and I can attest to the feeling of wanting to just give up on some days. My first dialysis experience was unforgettable. I have never felt so weak after my first dialysis and this is coming from someone who has been experiencing weakness for months leading up to my kidney transplant schedule. It literally felt like my entire energy was sucked out of me after the 3-hour session. That was the reaction on my body. Some people are different and they’re perfectly fine after their dialysis session. I suppose I was just lucky back then because I was a bit younger. However, for a 61-year-old man who may have issues other than ESRD and diabetes (he was a known chain smoker), maybe PNoy just couldn’t hold on much longer and he simply just decided to give up. My will to hold on essentially came from my desire to still live for my son’s sake. Maybe if PNoy had a family and a child of his own, perhaps he would have had a stronger motivation to fight. Hearing reports that PNoy died without any of his family and friends within his immediate presence certainly brings about a depressing picture to an outsider – what more for the person suffering from such a debilitating disease? Loneliness at one’s lowest point in life can certainly be depressing. This may very well offer the simplest explanation to PNoy’s death. PNoy may have been too weak and depressed to hold on. I do not believe he willingly chose to die so that the country can have a political change like what some Yellow adherents seem to be suggesting.
This brings me to the main point I am trying to drive at. Yellow adherents seem to be trying to, once again, drum up public and political support using necropolitics by putting a spin on the sad demise of PNoy. For instance, Jesuit priest Jose Ramon Villarin said that:
“Kung broken hearted si Noynoy, alam kong dahil din ito sa hati ang puso ng bayan.  Ang dalamhati ng bayan, siya ring dala-dala ng taong ito […] Ang broken heart ng taong ito, nasobrahan din ng broken heart ng taumbayan.  Ang broken heart ng bayan ay lalo pang nagagasgasan ng kagaspangan ng kung ano-anong dahas na walang pinagpipitagan.  Ang karahasan at pananakot, na panakip-butas lamang sa isang malalim na kahinaan,”
It is amazing how Yellow propagandists like this Jesuit priest are using PNoy’s death as an opportunity to cheap snipe at the current administration. Never mind how silly the claim is that the nation is “divided”, it is the height of absurdity for this priest to assume that the more than 90% approval rating of the current administration translates to the nation being “divided”. If what the priest is suggesting is true, that PNoy felt that the country is “divided”, then didn’t this priest just do PNoy a huge disservice by giving the impression that PNoy was delusional while on his deathbed? To cheap snipe at the current administration’s alleged heavy-handed ways of dealing with the people while keeping mum at the PNoy administration’s failure in terms of institutional reforms when it comes to Human Rights is quite rich. I wonder what this priest was doing when Philippine military and paramilitary groups allegedly killed more than a dozen tribal leaders, tribal community members and local rights groups in 2015? I wonder what this priest was doing back in 2015 when the failed state of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a place where extra judicial killings and death by hacking is as common as parking tickets, has been deemed more peaceful than the Philippines according to the Global Peace Index? Noynoying, perhaps?
Then there’s Yellow PR spinster Yoly Villanueva-Ong who said:
So PNoy’s death was an act of “ultimate sacrifice”? Gee… I didn’t know that poor health resulting from fatty food, uncontrolled diabetes and habitual smoking is now considered to be an act of heroism! If there are people who deserve such a praise, I would rather pick the valiant SAF-44 over someone who may have had one too many Crispy Patas, sodas, and Dunkin’ Donuts.
To suggest that an evil force has infected Filipinos for embracing the present administration and that PNoy’s death paves the way to correct this alleged wrong just goes to show how disingenuous necropolitics is. Necropolitics merely exploits the death of a person in order to achieve a political end and in the case of Yellows – to “reclaim” power in 2022. It is quite sad for Ong to reduce PNoy as a mere prop to be manipulated in order to achieve an end because Ong diminishes PNoy’s intrinsic value in itself by merely focusing on how PNoy’s death can help her preferred political party benefit. This is the fundamental problem with necropolitics – it essentially violates Kantian ethics by using someone as a mere means.  To use someone as a mere means is to involve the person in something to which they could not, in principle, consent. Kinda hard to get PNoy’s consent for his death to be used as a tool to propel the Yellows back in power in 2022 at this point unless Ong is very much into Ouija boards, I suppose.
Why can’t many of these Yellows simply remember PNoy for his admirable traits and not use his death as another vehicle to promote a political end? There have been two Aquinos already whose deaths have been weaponized in our country’s history and neither one has really made our country great. Yellow necropolitics has only led to further division in our country as it has been used, time and again, to cancel, ostracize, humiliate, and destroy people who don’t belong to the politics of the Yellows. We do not need another one. The Yellows should prove themselves worthy of the people’s trust once more not for riding on another Aquino’s death nor inflating PNoy’s death as some sort of ultimate sacrifice (because it wasn’t). The Yellow politicians should sell themselves to the Filipinos for their own merit instead. Is that so hard to ask?

The Philippines’ “Bucket List” – a vision for a better country,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-philippines-bucket-list/,"Before we get into the meat of this post, I think an explanation on the term “bucket list” is owed towards those out of the loop. A bucket list is a list of activities a person intends to do before they die or, idiomatically speaking, before they “kick the bucket.” This is not to say that the Philippines will die soon. That will be overly dramatic. I simply fancied calling this piece a bucket list just because. Walang basagan ng trip.Moving on.If the PH is to move forward to prosperity, it must prioritize the following:1. Elimination of internal State enemies (i.e. CPP-NPA and its legal fronts) and enhance security.2. Decentralize government power to ensure equal development of other regions. To ensure this, shifting to a Federal-Parliamentary system is necessary.3. Liberalize the economy by opening it to Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), coupled with continuous development of infrastructure to accommodate incoming investors, and amending/revising the Constitution to remove economic provisions therein. It is rather shortsighted of the framers of the 1987 Constitution to include economic provisions in something so rigid and resistant to change such as the mother law of the land. Such a measure has been proven a hindrance to economic growth as subsequent economic legislation must adhere to those provided in the Constitution. This in turn makes economic policies suffer a quick obsolescence without an efficient workaround.4. Continuity in policies must be observed. This has been the complaint of investors in the country as with every president, the Philippines is taken into a new direction which either weakens or altogether nullifies the predecessor’s efforts. To do this, term limits must be removed. The Philippines is a democratic republic and as such, should not be worried of baseless fears of political dynasties since this is a mere by-product of democracy. The shifting to a Parliamentary system ensures that an erring MP or PM is removed from office through a simple and efficient vote of confidence. As it stands, the process of impeachment is too tedious and costly that weathering an incompetent president is seen as the more practical solution.5. Effectively, the Philippines must be put under a strong rule. Stronger than the current administration, if possible. Heavy investment must be poured towards the military and law enforcement. This ensures that Philippines can flex its own political muscle against future foreign aggressors and internal threats. Strong military ensures that we have a voice in the international community. One that will be heard and respected.6. Press freedom must be curbed. As shown in the previous years, the media enjoyed too much freedom in maligning the administration to the international community. This gave interveners (such as the USA) the free pass to disrespect our sovereignty. Press freedom is overrated and unneeded in nation-building. We can worry about such lofty ideals once we reach first-world levels. Lastly,7. Yellows and Reds must be eradicated from our political landscape. People from both leanings have exhibited political immaturity in that they are unwilling to work with anyone outside their clique toward a common goal. The Yellows have been proven to be nothing but self-serving politicos willing to politicize even the dead for their own political gain. The Reds, estranged bedfellows of the Yellows, indoctrinate the youth into a Cold War era cause that struggles for relevance in the 21st century.The Philippines needs pragmatic politicians—ones that are willing to set aside political colors, and come up with concrete and quantifiable solutions which may be deemed neither ideal nor popular but necessary.On the other hand, idealistic bozos must be, if not altogether shunned, be treated with suspicion as idealism has historically caused more than half of the world’s problems.All in all, if the Philippines is to prosper, it must do away with motherhood statements and look for hard solutions. It must discard its obsolete government system as “voting wisely” has clearly failed time and time again.And for the love of the gods, just get rid of the Yellows and Reds.",Politics
Noynoy Aquino is NOT Jesus Christ,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/noynoy-aquino-is-not-jesus-christ/,"Whoever tweeted the phrase “whenever the Philippines is in trouble, an Aquino dies” should be commended. In a single sentence, that one tweet encapsulated the dishonest agenda of several decades of Yellowtard narrative.
The death of Noynoy Aquino is being perverted beyond all recognition by the Philippine Opposition. The Second Aquino Administration is practically being touted as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The most shocking thing of it all is that the top “thought leaders” and “influencers” of Yellowtardom expect Filipinos to believe that!
The parallels to Christian narrative cannot be ignored. The Son was sent to the chosen people who then preached the Good Word and then died to rejoin His parents in heaven from which they will then look down upon their “saved” people for all eternity. A cartoon drawn by comic book artist Jojo Hilario illustrates this insidious payload in the messaging being broadcasts by the choirs of Opposition trumpeteers…
The speed with which merchandising opportunities were seized also speaks to the reality of the timing of Aquino’s death — an important election year for the Yellowtards.
The Opposition are basically pointing out to Filipinos that they owe the Aquinos — for the ultimate “sacrifice” of Ninoy in 1983, for the stepping up of Cory in 1986 to lead a movement to “rescue” Filipinos from a “tyrant”, and for the summoning of The Son to messianic greatness in 2009. No less than veneration is expected. That call to worship is not only being sounded today. It began even before the dust settled following the great 1986 Yellowtard coup d’état when Aquino monuments, shrines, and statues sprung up all over the Philippines to which Filipinos were expected to tingala to by the powers-that-be.
The Jesus Christ narrative is a powerful one and it worked wonders on the Filipino people — a people who take pride in being one of the biggest (by headcount) Catholic devotees on the planet. The Yellowtards have capitalised this national character and built vast fortunes off it in partnership with their overlords in Rome. Their fear is that Noynoy is the last political Aquino that they could milk.
Then again, think again.
There is another.

Filipinos should remain vigilant. Politicians aspiring for a piece of the 2022 vote must take heed. This is a new era. The Yellow brand is no longer the colour of political and moral ascendancy it once was. And, no, Noynoy Aquino is not Jesus Christ.",Politics
Revisiting my regard for Noynoy Aquino,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/revisiting-my-regard-for-noynoy-aquino/,"To be upfront about it, it was impossible not to feel even a slight tinge of discomfort on news of former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino’s passing. I started blogging two years into his term, and I gave him hell whenever there was an undesirable event, effect, or outcome related to his government’s goings-on. The thesis of Get Real Philippines, which I still stand by after all these years, focuses on the cultural dysfunction found in Filipino society. Political dysfunction is a result of the cultural one; BS Aquino, at that time, embodied dysfunctional culture to a T. Blogging during his presidency was rather easy to do because he and his administration provided plenty of material to work with.
In light of his death, do I now have remorse/regret for criticizing him back then? The answer is easy, I do not. Based on the circumstances, data, and my critical thinking faculties at that time, I took my positions on issues – which more often than not put me on the opposite side of Aquino’s supporters, the Yellowtards. I do it currently with sitting president Rodrigo Duterte; I would’ve done it regardless of whoever won the 2016 elections.
But I digress.
It would have been simple enough to let people air their memories with the dead. Filipinos, however, true to form, simply cannot restrain themselves from injecting politics into any discussion. It happens on both sides, whether it be the Opposition, where the remaining (closet) Yellowtards want a three-peat of the dead Aquino emo vote catapult, or the pro-Duterte, who will vigorously defend their precarious sandcastle majority with “indecent” language. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter who started the politicization and the mudslinging first; what does is that there has been no change in the speed and extent to which the “debate” devolves into prick-waving and gutter talk.
I looked at my social media timelines, and I saw two separate worlds, chalk and cheese, in commemoration/recall of the past. On one hand, I saw the recall of those who worked with/under him, and they genuinely speak of a man who, in their view, did his best, and was generally one of the nicest guys to hang around with. I had also seen how some of the educated would speak of how proud they were to be Filipino under his time (kay sarap maging Pilipino); one can trace that to the economic growth they perceived during his term (spoiler: it was because of his predecessor Gloria Arroyo), and the deodorized foreign news releases about his administration.
On the other hand, BS Aquino’s critics were there to provide the other perspective. As I already mentioned, the economic growth is due to the sound fundamentals planted in GMA’s term. His government’s response to Typhoon Haiyan was a masterclass in disastrous disaster management. The eight HK tourists who died in that bus and the SAF 44 who died in Mamasapano are most likely waiting for him in the next life, too.
If you haven’t figured it out yet, the more privileged took to Noynoy because of how he made them feel. I don’t think I would be wrong in saying that all that “education” and “privilege” was useless because, being Filipino, they still suspended their “critical evaluation” in the face of Yellowtard rhetoric. But below a certain societal point, it became all about feeling something else – results. People were still poor, hungry, and some were left to fend for themselves. The survivors of those who died due to force majeure/mismanagement were brushed off/treated in a rather cavalier manner. It came to the point that mainstream media, despite PNoy’s incessant complaints about unfavorable coverage, simply couldn’t hide the stink anymore.
Unfortunately, the proponents of these two different perspectives have not sat down and talked about moving forward together. It didn’t happen when Ferdinand Marcos died, it didn’t happen either when both Ninoy and Cory checked out too. The point here is that the predominant way of “teaching history” here in the Philippines is not getting all the differing perspectives to sit down together and make a comprehensive account; rather, it is to propagate only one point of view, in this case the Yellowtard view,shut out others, shove it down everybody else’s throats, and ostracize people for not toeing the line. It would’ve continued to work – but Rodrigo Duterte was elected president in 2016.
While reading through the recollections of how Noynoy was supposedly a nice guy, it brings up memories of a trait that is prevalent among the older Filipinos, even one I witnessed in my own family. In the vernacular, it can be expressed as “mabait sa kaibigan at pamilya, kupal sa iba” (kind to friends and family, a dick to strangers). I’m not saying BS Aquino was a dick, but the differing recollections of how people knew him puts forth an uncomfortable, and debilitating, reality – that perhaps Pinoys will take another long while to extend their kindness and consideration beyond their own clans.
Next, there’s this (supposed to be) simple matter of “respecting the dead.”
You really can’t fault Duterte’s supporters for acting the way they did. A common theme among Duterte’s critics – many of them Yellowtards – is that there’s the “wishing him dead” social media posts. You don’t get a moral high ground to admonish the people on showing the respect for their dead when you disrespect the living.
Let’s put this out there; the only difference between the Aquino and Duterte cults is the personality that each worships. Yet the zealotry, rabidity, and the sensitivity to differing perspectives – you’re looking at two sides of the same coin. Unlucky for the former, however, they’re now the minority because their candidate, Mar Roxas, didn’t win the election; the dominant force and its constituents will push back if you “don’t know your place.”
Supporters of the Aquino family and the Liberal Party have already utilized the sympathy vote for a dead family member twice already. You really can’t fault them for trying a third time. A few friends/colleagues of mine note the impact of social media in influencing the vote – something I had always downplayed. Even without social media, however, I doubt Noynoy could ever match the emotional attachment that propaganda successfully created for his parents. Digital age or not, Pinoy emo transcends the times, but generally Pinoys have a finely honed radar for detecting insincerity. In Noynoy’s case, Filipinos would’ve been very good at discerning “pure and innocent” from an “immature simpleton”.
Lastly, let’s look at the notion that Noynoy Aquino was not corrupt. Whether it be not corrupt, or kind, or uncompromising on quality, or whatever, if the people around you don’t measure up, then your own virtues don’t count for shit. I find this situation common between BS Aquino and Rodrigo Duterte. In Noynoy’s case, he may have been not corrupt and held himself to a high standard, but ultimately he was done in by the fact that his cabinet was riddled with Peter-principles; Duterte unfortunately faces the same fate. Both sides’ supporters want their idol to be cast in history based on how he made them feel, but ultimately it’s the results that matter – and those who write the books.
Let’s close this chapter on Philippine necropolitics, shall we? I really do hope Noynoy gets to rest in peace; unfortunately his death is inevitably going to be used to revive a political entity on life support. The Yellowtards have been all about Laban (they still are), and yet I don’t think anyone could have ever imagined that their revolution required eating up members of the Aquino family. Or maybe they did, especially when they figured out how potent it was.
EDSA is DEAD. Ninoy is DEAD. Cory is DEAD. And now Noynoy is DEAD. If the Yellowtards need to keep on relying on dead bodies to prop their revolution up, then perhaps that collective entity too is already DEAD – still walking aimlessly, but essentially DEAD.
It’s time Filipinos keep dead entities, well…DEAD.",Politics
Salamat Noynoy: Remembering his bullet-riddled legacy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/salamat-noynoy-remembering-his-bullet-riddled-legacy/,"It was 1987 when Cory’s administration faced a military coup (one of 6 plots to overthrow her) in which Noynoy Aquino was hit 5 times by attacking rogue soldiers at Malacanang. Three of his bodyguards were killed during the attack, but he survived with one bullet remaining embedded in his neck as a remembrance.
We could not tell what was going on in Noynoy’s mind while the SAF44 were being riddled with gunfire from Muslim separatists, with their pleas for a rescue falling on unresponsive ears. His thoughts would probably sound like the following: “Just as my bodyguards in 1987 died as human shields defending me, you should all be sacrificed for my shot at a Nobel Peace Prize”, or “If I had to endure a rain of bullet fire, so should you guys.”
Lack of empathy is what many will remember of this guy, akin to Nero fiddling while Rome burned. The song Nero by Steve Taylor comes to mind…
Nero’s watching video while Rome begins to burn
Nero’s wearing roller skates so he can quickly turn
Get away from all he does and what to see or what to hear
Nero’s wearing headphones and they stretch from ear to ear
Nero’s got a private world for which the heart may yearn
Nero’s watching video while Rome begins to burn
A country run like hell
PNoy brought to realization Pres. Manuel Quezon’s “run like hell” quotable quote.
The 15th president of the Philippines will be remembered not only by his being literally bullet-riddled but also by his bullet-riddled legacy. I guess no other Philippine president has been attacked by critics as immensely as PNoy and his administration. Let’s run down through his “greatest hits”:
You voted for an ill-equipped unqualified president with no track record of examplary performance; that’s what you get. We are not surprised. But did anything good come out of his presidency? Well there are at least 3 things we can thank Noynoy for:
End of the Aquino Dynasty?
With the only son of Ninoy and Cory Aquino passing away loveless and childless, there is no direct heir of the Aquino surname to take advantage of whatever political capital remains for Yellow royalty. This ends this chapter in Philippine history – the experiment of placing in positions of power people who have no real credentials to handle the complexities of a nation as culturally challenged as ours.
Aquino now equates to incompetent leadership. No politician in his/her right mind will want to be associated with this name if they want even a slim chance of getting elected. Using the Aquino / Yellow brand is tantamount to political suicide. Even Mar Roxas in the last senatorial elections seemed to realize this and began to distance himself.
It’s time we close this failed experimental cookbook of installing incompetent leaders. Napaso na tayo. Time to get back on track and run with the East Asian stallions. Vietnam has just overtaken us and is steaming ahead taking in a huge chunk of FDI and leaving us to bite the dust. Let’s leave it to the mentally qualified and extremely gifted to set down the vision and strategy that will bring the country out of its basket case conditions.
No, the country is not divided as the Yellow camp thinks. A noisy minority does not constitute a real 50/50 division (like what we saw in US’ Trump vs. Biden). The country is generally united now in our desire to install a leader who can bring back intelligent and competent governance into the equation of running this country.
Will Filipinos again elect an unqualified someone just because his papa/mama/asawa/kapatid died? Hopefully we can say “Never Again” for a very long time.",Politics
Yellowtards gaslighting Filipinos into believing Noynoy Aquino was a great man is EMOTIONAL ABUSE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/yellowtards-gaslighting-filipinos-into-believing-noynoy-aquino-was-a-great-man-is-emotional-abuse/,"The edification of Noynoy Aquino continues. “Soul-searching” is often mentioned. Few of his faults are highlighted in death. It’s his achievements which are being bruited about along with the anecdotes about how “good” a person he was. I bought into all these in 1983 after his father former Senator Ninoy Aquino was assassinated. No Internet at that time. There was no Inquirer or Star yet. But there was Malaya later on and the other publications of the so-called Mosquito Press. Being a news hog, I lapped up everything.
In all-too-familiar form, Inquirer columnist Joel Ruiz Butuyan asks the question, “Will his death trigger a national soul-searching?”, and then goes on to answer it thus…
When Ninoy Aquino died, it triggered a massive soul-searching for our people, and it resulted in a huge political upheaval. When Cory Aquino passed on, her death generated a second round of soul-searching that swayed the political course of our country. Will Noynoy’s death spark a third round of soul-searching for our country? I sure hope so, because we desperately need another one.

The premise of then President Noynoy’s Daang Matuwid (“straight path”) mantra was none other than former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). Daang matuwid was supposed to be everything the Arroyo administration was not even if she was part of the same political alliance that installed her as President after Erap was ousted by Noynoy’s people. Arroyo was a convenient punching bag for the Aquino administration each time something went wrong. Awarded infrastructure projects were cancelled without basis resulting in great expense to Filipino taxpayers in terms of damages awarded in arbitration. Recall the same scenario when the Arroyo administration found fault in the contract for NAIA-3 with Fraport. But no credit was given to GMA for her fiscal reforms which laid the basis for the economic growth brought about by low interest rates as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008.
Infrastructure was also neglected despite the announcement that the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) was the flagship program of the Aquino administration. The MRT-3 became symbol of commuter suffering in the National Capital Region (NCR) after Sumitomo was relieved as its maintenance provider by the then Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). There was the botched handling of the Luneta Hostage crisis, the Zamboanga siege and Mamasapano which reflected badly the on the abilities of Aquino when it came to crisis leadership. Drugs were easily available. A PDEA and UN report stated that majority of barangays in the country had a serious drug problem. There was a shabu tiangge operating in Pasig. Theft of spare tires, car batteries and side mirrors of vehicles parked on the street were rampant.
There were also the corruption scandals in rice, garlic and onion imports, and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) in the Impeachment Trial of then Chief Justice Renato Corona. The Corona impeachment itself was suspect given that it did not pass through the plenary but, instead, was transmitted to the Senate based solely on the signatures of majority of the Congressmen loyal to the administration. There was also the corruption scandal at the Bureau of Corrections where drugs were openly sold and drug lords enjoyed privileges, even running their operations from renovated quarters complete with creature comforts. One even had a live sound and recording studio constructed.
Who can forget travellers entering the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) with their luggage bubble-wrapped because of tanim-bala? There was the Atimonan shootout in Quezon involving the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Army where the P200 million in cash being transported was never recovered. Finally, there was Janet Lim-Napoles and the arrest of the opposition Senators who were expected to run for higher office in 2016. Despite photos showing Napoles and the immediate members of her family with the President and other high-ranking elected and appointed officials of the administration, no investigation was launched against them by then Justice Secretary Leila De Lima. In fact, Napoles was even brought to the Palace after she surfaced and was even escorted to Camp Crame by no less than then Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas!
Were these all figments of our imagination? Didn’t these events actually take place? Could it be that we actually caused grave injustice to one of the best President’s this country ever had? Were we and 16 million other Filipinos deranged and delusional when we voted for Rodrigo Duterte as President in May 2016? Could it be possible that Duterte himself engaged the services of the infamous barangs of Siquijor to cast a spell on Filipinos to vote for him? Do these barangs continue to hold sway over us that a collective exorcism by Archbishop Socrates Villegas is necessary in order to break the spell they have cast? Are we actually living in a tyrannical and authoritarian dictatorship without us ever realizing we are in one? Could Rodrigo Duterte be the devil incarnate written about in the bible? Is the pandemic a conspiracy between Xi Jing Pin and Duterte for control of the South China Sea? Or could it really be that we finally realized the gaslighting which held sway over us from 1986 to 2016 which is why we are now in the reality of our existence?

Gaslighting is a psychological term commonly used in the assessment of narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissists are gaslighters because they exist in their own fantasy world where everything is according to their plan. Narcissists constantly need validation. They have an inflated sense of entitlement and will never admit to being wrong about anything. The victims of narcissists are often emotional and psychological wrecks because they are natural empaths. A narcissist is incapable of showing empathy. To them it is all about their needs and wants which need to be satisfied. It is ever about others around them. The victims of narcissists who do not see through all of their faults are called co-dependents. Co-dependents are generally weak-willed individuals who are led by the nose by the narcissist. The narcissist is in constant need of supply. Supply comes in the form of admiration, validation and generally doing and believing in everything the narcissist says. The co-dependent is always trying to reach the higher bar set by the narcissist in order to avoid being discarded. Gaslighting is very effective when used on co-dependents as a control mechanism. It literally can drive a person mad because of the distorted reality to the point that the victim does not possess the ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy. The constant passing the buck for the consequences of the narcissist’s actions often leads the victim to start believing that HE IS the narcissist in the relationship because of the mirroring the narcissist engages in as part of gaslighting.
Filipinos have been the victim of the Yellowidiots’ gaslighting for far too long. It’s time they put their collective foot down.",Politics
Lukewarm public regard for the death of Noynoy Aquino proves that Yellow necropolitics no longer works,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/lukewarm-public-regard-for-the-death-of-noynoy-aquino-proves-that-yellow-necropolitics-no-longer-works/,"Last week, Filipinos woke up to rumors on social media that former President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III had died. Later in the morning, reporters and bystanders trooped to the Capitol Medical Center in Quezon City, where Aquino was rushed from his West Triangle home, as family members, former Aquino Cabinet officials and Liberal Party stalwarts began arriving. As the crowd gathered in front of the hospital began to grow, the Aquino family members and those close to them finally broke the news that the former President had, indeed, passed away.
As expected, tributes to Noynoy from family members, friends, former colleagues in the government, the media and even political foes began pouring in, as his remains was transferred from the Capitol Medical Center to the Heritage Park mortuary in Taguig, where a brief wake was held. His remains were later cremated, with his ashes brought to the Ateneo de Manila University, his alma mater, where another brief wake and funeral mass was held. From the Ateneo de Manila University, the former President’s cremated remains were brought by family members to their mausoleum at the Manila Memorial Park in Paranaque, to be laid to rest alongside his parents, former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino, Jr. and former President Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino.
While there is nothing wrong with paying tribute to the former President, it seems that his political allies, supporters and the media could not resist the temptation of exploiting the opportunity of using his passing to achieve a particular self-serving partisan agenda. Noynoy’s “achievements” were particularly trumped up as if he is god-like, saying that all of the country’s “economic gains” and “stability” should be credited to him. Even the current “Build! Build! Build!” infrastructure building drive of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte was not spared as his political allies, supporters, and the media keep on saying that most, if not all, of the current projects were credited to Noynoy. This, despite the fact that independent economic experts repeatedly said in the past that the Aquino administration severely under-spent on infrastructure that could have provided Metro Manila with some relief from congestion, more efficient means of transport of passengers and cargo between cities and regions, and economic development and prosperity to places outside of the Greater Manila Area and Metro Cebu, and that most of the “Public-Private Partnership (PPP)” projects during his time were not fulfilled until his successor, Rodrigo Duterte, took over.
The most obvious propaganda being used by the “Dilawans” — at a time when they are supposed to be mourning the passing of Noynoy — was that the former President brought “honor”, “decency”, “intelligence” and “honesty” during his time in office. When I heard of that, I just shook my head in disbelief considering how he and the people around him handled situations such as the Luneta bus hostage crisis, the visit of Super Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda, the slaughter of 44 Philippine National Police Special Action Force officers at Mamasapano, and the mass inoculation of the untested Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine on children and teens from the D and E classes. Add to that how they pounced on former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo by placing her on hospital arrest for four years on trumped-up charges that were dismissed by the courts, and how they used funds from the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP), which was later declared as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, to be distributed to senators and congressmen in the impeachment and character assassination of then Chief Justice Renato Corona, who later died in trying to clear his name from the accusations hurled against him. Both Macapagal-Arroyo and Corona were persecuted by Noynoy and his administration for their role in the Supreme Court final and executory decision on Hacienda Luisita, which was declared to be subject to land reform and be distributed to its 6,000 farmer-beneficiaries, and the government will only pay the Cojuangcos P200 million based on 1989 land valuation instead of the 2006 valuation of P5 billion.
With the 2022 elections fast approaching, it is obvious that Noynoy’s family members, political allies, supporters and the media are again resorting to necropolitics in hopes of reviving the political fortunes of the “Dilawan” and also the “Pulahan” at a time when President Rodrigo Duterte, the long-time mayor of Davao City and political outsider who was swept into power in 2016 on a pragmatism-based platform of getting rid of narcotics, crime and corruption, is still enjoying high levels of popularity, trust and approval among the majority of Filipinos, and his daughter, current Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, has a comfortable lead over possible opponents for the presidency. Necropolitics worked well twice for the Cojuangco-Aquino clan and its political allies, first between 1983 and 1986 after Ninoy was killed upon his arrival in Manila from the United States and when there was growing dissatisfaction among members of the military towards the then already sick President Ferdinand Marcos, and again in 2009 to 2010 when Cory died of cancer. Cory benefited from necropolitics in 1986 after her running-mate, Salvador “Doy” Laurel, gave way to her and several elements of the military and the United states backed her. Noynoy benefited from necropolitics in 2009 after Mar Roxas, who was too unpopular compared to then Senator Manny Villar and former President Joseph Estrada, gave way to him in hopes of thwarting a Villar or Estrada presidency.
Times and situations are different in 2021 compared to 1983 to 1986 and 2009 to 2010. Cojuangco-Aquino necropolitics worked in the past because it was buoyed by oligarch-owned local and United States media, and there was no way to counter propaganda favoring the clan and its allies. The same cannot be said in 2021, as social media has now become at par with mainstream media, especially in reporting the news and countering propaganda coming from both local and foreign media, oligarch-owned ABS-CBN and the Philippine Daily Inquirer being a shell of their former selves, especially ABS-CBN, which, no thanks to Noynoy himself, now has no legislative franchise to operate, and Rappler being the least trusted media outfit in the country.
However, one thing has not changed from the past, and that is necropolitics has the tendency to thrive because Filipinos are too emotional and not that mature as a people when it comes to democratic politics. Filipinos love underdogs, and this is especially true when propaganda to make the other side look “inaapi” or “nakakaawa” is used to win their favor. This is a formula being banked upon by those who think that necropolitics still has a room in political discourse in this day and age, both on a national scale, such as in the case of the Cojuangco-Aquino clan, and a local scale, such as in the case of a non-politician daughter of a slain mayor in the CALABARZON region being elected as mayor of their locality just because her father was killed in front of city hall in broad daylight and that the residents believed that she would continue the “good work” of her father.
I would like to believe that Filipinos are now more mature, smarter and less easily-swayed by any type of propaganda, especially one that has to do with necropolitics. That is perhaps the reason why, so far, there seems to be no large-scale outpouring of grief from the public after the passing on Noynoy, and the majority of the Filipinos does not seem to buy the opinion of political analysts, and “Dilawan” and “Pulahan” politicians and academics, who claim that the former President’s death will be a “game changer” in 2022 elections in such a way that it will help boost the chances of “Dilawan” and “Pulahan” politicians and parties against candidates and parties who are allied with President Rodrigo Duterte. If that is a sign that Filipinos have long ditched necropolitics, and are now smarter and more mature compared to how members of the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, where the Cojuangco-Aquino clan belongs, see them, then I should say that it is a welcome development that I hope will continue and will never changed anymore.",Politics
Duterte trolling the Opposition with VP run confirmation.

Motherhood statements will not cut it in political campaigns anymore specially in this environment where sorties and rallies aren’t allowed. The voters are looking for certainty in a situation where the only certainty is uncertainty. Specific plans of action moving forward are what voters will be looking at buying, not motherhood statements and appeal to emotions. And for god’s sake, enough of going back into the past with the Aquino-Marcos issue. Ninoy and Noynoy are dead and buried. That’s the end of it. How the country will move forward is what voters will respond to. The old Opposition is dead and they still didn’t get that memo.
A new Opposition should rise. One that will not run with the notion that taking potshots at the administration is the performance of the fiscalizer function. It’s easy to level accusations of corruption in government. We already know that. What should be done about it? What’s your plan if ever you’re elected? You can’t talk about issues-based politics without walking the walk. Set the example. The 21-45 demographic is 40M Filipinos. These are the true digital natives. Filipinos who were born with a mobile device in their hands.
Just as Duterte disrupted the traditional campaign template in 2016, so should any candidate running in this election cycle. The pandemic has brought about the new normal in political campaigns. It’s already here. The candidate who has the best chance in 2022 is one who both adopts and adapts to the disruption and will cause his own disruption.",Politics
Songs of praises to the glory of Noynoy Aquino will fail to move a politically-mature Filipino public,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/songs-of-praises-to-the-glory-of-noynoy-aquino-will-fail-to-move-a-politically-mature-filipino-public/,"Manila Standard columnist Banayo conspicuously leaves out former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos in the mention of Philippine Presidents in his piece “A stone for the edifice” where he shares his own version of Pantheon. The piece is obviously in praise of the recently departed former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino.
It is easy for us to criticize presidents from the armchairs and the laptops we write upon.
A free press and the freedom of expression, after all, are the hallmarks of democracy, without which, authoritarianism prevails. The checks and balances enhanced by public criticism are essential to fostering good governance from our rulers by pointing out shortcomings and when substantiated, failures in moral and legal standards.
But we should give credit where credit is due. To snipe at perceived failures of a former president simply because these are borne by biases and prejudice are not only in poor taste, but poor judgment.
Let history judge, and let generations after, measure the stone, or stones, each president leaves in the edifice of nation-building.
Banayo seems to have forgotten the maxim that with great power comes even greater responsibility and expectation. Elpidio Quirino was felled by his golden pisspot. Ramon Magsaysay died under mysterious circumstances in a plane crash. Diosdado Macapagal was a one-term President brought down by the Stonehill scandal. Fidel Ramos was off to a good start but it’s he who’s largely responsible for our water and power woes up to this time.
The truth is there wasn’t much reconstruction and rehabilitation from the destruction wrought by World War II until Marcos became President. Since his ouster, it is only now that the focus on infrastructure has been realized. Perhaps the better question is, why can’t we heap praises on Presidents while they are still living? Why do we have to wait for them to pass on? Perhaps it’s the heat of the moment? Most of the public tend to believe media reports without being able to read between the lines. Then there is partisan bias fuelled by class issues. I’ve said before that two of our biggest problems are the entitled rich and the entitled poor. It’s the middle class who bears the most burden but they are also the most silent as they go about their daily lives.
Tomorrow will mark the seven-day anniversary of Aquino’s passing but the edification will not end. The bashing that Aquino got which began during the middle of his term has Duterte enduring the same from the beginning of his. It is not likely to end after he steps down. Duterte doesn’t bitch and whine. He doesn’t make demands on the owner of a broadcast network or a broadsheet for some anchor or columnist to be removed. He has been called all sorts of names but he doesn’t react. Compare this with the President who was furious over the term “noynoying” which came to be used to describe the overall character of his administration. This was coined by the print media then due to the then President’s seemingly long absences from the public eye. Aquino never held Cabinet meetings. He also never bothered to visit troops in their camps. He didn’t bother to show up for the arrival honors of the men massacred at Mamasapano, who followed the orders he had given as commander in-chief.
The best barometer of a President’s performance is the public’s judgment. Post-Marcos presidents have had no success anointing their chosen ones. Ramos’ victory was tainted by electoral fraud. It was thinner than President Rodrigo Duterte’s 39% plurality. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s (GMA’s) candidate Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro lost in 2010. So did Aquino’s Mar Roxas in 2016. Should Duterte’s anointed win, would that finally silence his detractors? Not really. Our politicians have not yet reached that level of maturity. The same is true with the public. In this case, it is the classic chicken-or-egg conundrum; which comes first? The maturity of the politicians or that of the public?
We are facing huge challenges brought about by the pandemic. They will not end soon. In the coming election, we should focus more on issues, not personalities. We shouldn’t fall for motherhood statements anymore. What we need to hear and read about are concrete plans if action moving forward. We shouldn’t fall for edification traps which tug at our emotional heartstrings which has often ended in us, the public, holding the short end of the stick while politicians laugh all the way to the bank with our monies.",Politics
The insanity that is the Philippine Presidential System—Why “voting wisely” never works,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-insanity-that-is-the-philippine-presidential-system-why-voting-wisely-never-works/,"The Presidential system, in the case of the Philippines, is a hit-or-miss phenomenon. You get a random Joe to run for the highest office in the land in a once-in-a-lifetime chance and hold said office for 6 years. If he’s bad, at least he’ll get to ruin the country for only 6 years. If he’s good, then you’ll be stuck there wishing he can run again for office and bless the country with his magic.The term limit imposed by the 1987 Constitution may have had the noble intention of preventing any would-be dictator from gaining unadulterated and unencumbered power. This is a reactionary provision inserted by the framers to prevent another Ferdinand Marcos from ever happening again. But as with any knee-jerk reaction, this proved to be more of a band-aid solution which now faces its obsolescence.How? For instance, the term limits imposed to positions under the Executive Branch perpetuated the now maligned “political dynasties.” The mentality behind which is that while the parent may no longer run for a position, then perhaps the scion will be as good as the parent.Term limits hinder the development of the nation as it renders continuity of policies a near impossibility. Every 6 years, we get a new president and every 6 years, the Philippines undergoes a coin toss when the new president decides to either continue his predecessor’s efforts in tandem with his own, or scrap the previous administration’s developments altogether and forge new policies—all for the sake of one’s ego and legacy. The same goes for the lower positions.Our system of checks and balances is self-defeating. While the idea behind it is undoubtedly good, the implementation is Kafkaesque. Too much is buried under layers upon layers of unnecessarily complex bureaucracy that by the time things are seemingly resolved, it’s election season again.Take the impeachment process. It’s a burden since it undergoes so much bureaucratic process, drama, and fanfare that weathering the president, no matter how bad he is, is deemed as the more “productive” approach. A non-functioning public servant should be easily dealt with.The Constitution provides immunity from suit to the president such that he may enjoy unencumbered productivity. Again, this is self-defeating. You need not grant immunity to the president if, in the first place, he can be replaced easily.This is where a Parliamentary setup one-ups the Presidential. Once the Prime Minister is deemed a liability to the interests of his party, his party members themselves are, if not forced, inclined to issue a “vote of no confidence” to replace the PM with a better one.See here’s the thing, some would argue that a Parliamentary setup will only encourage the “Padrino” system even more, and they are right. But not in a negative way. The parliamentary system forces parties to shape up lest they risk losing all of their positions come the general elections.The padrino system here is thereby put to good use such that the PARTY itself, not INDVIDUALS, will collude with each other to perform well so as not to lose the public’s faith. Effectively, they are forced to self-audit so they will not lose their House seat.Political personalities will be less common as “personality” is thrust upon each party and the ideas they represent, not merely on individuals that the masses will then worship like a Messianic figure. People should learn to look at ideas, not persons.The presidential system thrusts so much responsibility and power upon one person, and this leads to fanaticism. This gives off the impression that the president is a panacea to all our political ails when in truth, it takes multitude of warm bodies to run a State effectively.Despite the so-called system of checks and balances, it is ironic that erring presidents (or even lower public officials) are rarely held accountable. This is a manifestation of a dysfunctional system. It comes as no surprise since we merely copied it from the USA—a nation with an altogether different culture, geography, peoples, and history seen as alien especially since that the Philippines is an Asian nation.Indeed, systems shape our behavior. While we can argue that we need to put “good” people into position, that itself is a recipe for failure. Any government system that hinges its success upon the benevolence of its operators is doomed to fail.Too often, even “good” people turn bad if they’re stuck with a bad system. This has been the prevailing hijinks every election season: Put someone “good” then that someone ultimately becomes bad. Then if they were indeed deemed to be bad by the court of public opinion, cries for impeachment will be heard all over again. It’s a practice in insanity. It needs to change.It is not good enough that we put “good” people into position. There must also be a system in place that effectively forces them to BE good. Immunity from suit will not guarantee that, nor the costly drama of impeachment when a quick “vote of no confidence” will suffice.It is high time Filipinos stop thinking of politics as a moral battleground where there is an everlasting clash between the light and the darkness. Filipinos must instead look at politics as an industrial machine whose operators also look for competitive wages (read: self-interests) so they can make a living.It is high time Filipinos discard the ideal notion of altogether ridding politics of corruption. It is never going to happen. Politics provides power to those who know how to play and—cliché as it may be—power corrupts. It is up to the people to decide how they can make their politicos’ respective self-interests align with their own.Lastly, Filipinos must learn to think outside of their box and consider that maybe, just maybe, it is not the people in charge who are entirely at fault for the country’s problems but the very system of governance these people operate in.As it stands, people will always be a problem no matter what. They’re just people, after all. Corruption is part of human nature. Cynical as it sounds, it’s just how it is.The best we can hope for is to curb corruption by implementing a system that will effectively and efficiently eject or correct politicians who are performing subpar. The 1987 Constitution certainly does not allow that, nor does our current setup.The proof? History attests to it.",Politics
Candidates wanting to mount a CREDIBLE challenge to Duterte should avoid fake campaign “consultants”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/candidates-wanting-to-mount-a-credible-challenge-to-duterte-should-avoid-fake-campaign-consultants/,"The now self-appointed “Chief Political Analyst” and Dr La Salle University professor Antonio Contreras details in his Manila Times piece “Surveying beyond who is leading: Looking into the minds of voters” a survey on “what drives voters to make certain preferences and choices”. The survey, Contreras writes, aims to inform candidates making a bid for public office in the coming elections “hopefully to make them aware of the issues that influence those choices”.
While interesting to note that Contreras’s survey showed that, when asked what they consider to be most important when choosing candidates, respondents gave “lowest consideration to their having pleasing personalities”, there is not much new insight to be gleaned from its results.
A survey represents a snapshot of current public sentiment at a particular point in time. Consistency is key. The consistent names are still Duterte and Daughterte (i.e., the latter referring to Inday Sara Duterte). A lot can still change between now and May 2022. While Isko may be leading, public opinion will change once the campaign proper has begun and the debates are held. The Duterte brand has the equity of the incumbent.
Much has been said about the Philippines not being Davao, in relation to how the Duterte dynasty has been in place in the country’s largest city since 1986. Their track record speaks for itself, however. Former Manila Mayor Joseph “Erap” Estrada set the bar so low in Manila which is why current Mayor Isko Moreno, is looking good. But in terms of actual reforms, he still has his work cut out for him. Any challenger to the incumbent will face an uphill climb. Employing old campaign strategies will not work. For example, I don’t get why Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao et al don’t realize that the more they criticize the administration, the more their support base rallies to them. It is actually easier to just acknowledge what they have achieved and say I’m going to build on that and unify the country. Why this is so hard to do is reflective of the mindset of the principals and their advisers and their political maturity.
Data analytics has evolved to a point where you can measure the effectiveness of your communications and messaging and set key performance indices. You can adjust the messaging until you get the desired results. A data-driven campaign is now a reality. A campaign based on news stories being reposted on social media is not communicating with voters. The 21-45 demographic is 40-million-strong and millennials are notorious for their short attention spans. 250 words max and 15 seconds of video is the most they will tolerate. Candidates teams should be tech-savy, agile and flexible. The same should be true with the principals.
The pandemic will not end in the next five years so you’re looking at two election cycles under this environment. Time to adopt and adapt if you want to stay relevant. Competent campaign teams led by creative, original, and strategic thinkers are hard to find. There are many snake oil salesmen claiming they know what they are doing when in reality, what they’re selling is all smoke and mirrors and products of pre-social media thinking. It’s going to be a very interesting campaign season and, given the well-resourced machines and formidable personalities that spearhead the incumbent camp, those who aspire to pose even a credible challenge in this race cannot afford to invest in and waste time on mediocre campaign and comms teams staffed by schoolboy “analysts” and led by managers who apply dinosaur-era thinking.",Politics
"Strong nation, iron fist rule may be the path forward for the Philippines",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/strong-nation-iron-fist-rule-may-be-the-path-forward-for-the-philippines/,"Is Professor Randy David giving up on liberal democracy and being a progressive leftist militant? The ideology of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) is based on Maoist principles and yet, it is convenient for them to mouth insults and pro-Philippine epithets against their former patrons. Yet here is David seemingly touching on the hard truth in his piece Inquirer today “America and China: A tale of two systems”…
China’s eradication of mass poverty, its sustained growth, and its successful elevation to middle class status of a sizable segment of its population, appear to validate the vision of a strong nation led by a strong single-party State. Alas, it is democratic America that seems to be languishing economically, its institutions unable to fully arrest the drift toward populist authoritarianism.
The economic rise of China appears to be a Deng Xiao Ping and Lee Kuan Yew collaboration. Singapore can afford a certain level of “democracy” because of its population. China can’t because it has over a billion people. The US has a population of 320M and look at where it is at presently. The divide which brought the US Civil War on has been rekindled because the reforms weren’t put in place after the war ended with Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. The civil rights movement of the 60s ended with the Kennedy brothers’ assassination. Johnson did what he could but the Vietnam War prevented him from seeking another term. Trump’s win over Clinton in 2016 validated the sentiment that Roger Ailes realized when he organized Fox News for Rupert Murdoch.
Most liberals don’t realize the irony of how their desire for huge profits is one of the reasons why the social divide in the US has grown wider. America’s immigration problem is largely the result of its need for cheaper labor. The result is a potent mixture for unrest as what happened last January at the Capitol. What’s more interesting is the similarities between American liberal elitist mindsets with that of their Filipino counterparts. The landlocked states are the equivalent of the bobotantes Filipino elitists use to refer to the masses. What the Pinoy elitists don’t realize is the masses are waking up to the reality. They were largely responsible for the win of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.
David is a sociologist by training. The basis of his column today may be his realization that their cause in the Opposition is a lost one considering how they have thrown everything at Duterte and still managed to get nowhere in their bid to turn public opinion against him. It has been a week since his predecessor former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino passed away and his death has had no quantifiable impact on public opinion despite Opposition efforts to get the people to see him in a better light. Perhaps the people still cannot forget what they went through during his term no matter how much it was made to look like he was one of the better Presidents the country ever had.
The 2022 election is crucial because it is either a validation or a rejection of Duterte’s definition of democracy. Duterte is no Lee Kuan Yew by most measures but he has shown he is capable of making those who need to toe the line, toe the line. There is the direct threat to then Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano who refused to vacate his post to give way to his replacement. There is also the manner in which he gave the oligarchs who control the water distribution concession for the National Capital Region (NCR) no leeway when the water shortage hit in the summer of 2019. Cabinet level officials have been fired by Duterte, very much unlike the PNoy who tolerated bickering and inconsistent direction pursued by different Cabinet members. Just the other day, Duterte issued a veiled threat to Senate President Tito Sotto. Consider me a candidate for Vice-President. That was his way of telling Sotto I can still derail your political plan for 2022.
In a democracy, there is room for a mature and responsible opposition to act as a fiscalizer but not as a stumbling block to nation-building. It is unfortunate that those who have an eye at the Presidency still continue with their brickbats against the administration. This will not win them points with voters. The best strategy is to acknowledge the good which has been done and build on that. It should be an issues-based campaign focusing on public sentiment rather the old mindset of destructive criticism. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the more you hit Duterte the more his base closes ranks to protect him.
Potential candidates shouldn’t pass up on the opportunity to give those who are not in favor of Duterte’s style an intelligent choice in the coming polls by clearly articulating their vision of what an alternative path might look like. This is the essence of democracy. And who knows, if their argument is good enough, they just might win.",Politics
Natural gas BILLIONS behind an Opposition desperate to block another Duterte or Marcos presidency,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/natural-gas-billions-behind-an-opposition-desperate-to-block-another-duterte-or-marcos-presidency/,"Inquirer columnist Winnie Monsod in her piece “Will Duterte stand by PH, as P-Noy did?” gives us some inside insight into what may have gone one behind the scenes in the administration of the late former President Noynoy Aquino with regard to the South China Sea dispute. She relates how one faction within the administration led by then Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa Jr. was “playing dirty” by blocking close engagement between PNoy and the arbitration team led by then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario and then Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio. Monsod lists this, for example, among the “dirty tricks” Ochoa allegedly played in Malacanang…
Preventing a meeting between P-Noy and the lawyers of the Philippines in the arbitration case (making them wait four hours), and then giving them a presidential instruction which the President did not give. The President was not told that the lawyers were there (according to P-Noy himself), so how could he have given an instruction? Again, this shows disrespect, nay, contempt for the President’s ability to make a decision…
Jojo Ochoa is by no means a pushover of a lawyer. You don’t get to be City Administrator of Quezon City under Feliciano Belmonte if you’re a pushover. What Mareng Winnie doesn’t mention is the reason why the issue of Itu Aba was excluded by Ochoa. If you read the arbitral panel decision, there was the possibility of the  Kalayaan Island Group (KIG) being lost. Why? Former President Ferdinand Marcos only claimed the KIG after Tomas Cloma “discovered” it. In fact, the South China Sea islands have been in possession of either China, the French and the Japanese at various points in history. Itu Aba is part of Taiwan at present. Taiwan is a part of China. It follows that the Chinese are allowed their own EEZ in and around Itu Aba which would overlap with the KIG. Any question of sovereignty or jurisdiction could’ve worked against the Philippines, specially under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The US just used the Philippines as a stalking horse in order to go around any prohibition whenever it conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS) in the disputed waters. The Opposition fails to explain clearly to the interested public, the vagaries of the South China Sea dispute. As Ankit Panda wrote in his piece “5 Takeaways: A Closer Look at the Historic South China Sea Arbitration Award” published on The Diplomat, “The one open door–somewhat poetically–is Scarborough Shoal, the disputed feature that led Manila to the court in the first place. (After the award, Scarborough is a disputed feature, albeit within the Philippines’ EEZ.) The Tribunal’s award leaves some space for the two sides to come to an agreement on joint resource exploitation.”
The Philippines used to have possession of Scarborough Shoal until it was lost under the  Aquino administration. This cannot be denied yet the Opposition doesn’t admit it to the public. The ruling allows for joint exploitation of resources between the two countries. The same is true with Reed or Recto Bank which is part of the Second Thomas or Ayungin Shoal, where a Philippine Navy ship has been grounded to assert the sovereign claim. Jeremy Maxie writing for The Diplomat points out, “This could prove a compelling proposition for Manila since Reed Bank (Recto Bank), located approximately 80 nautical miles northwest of Palawan within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but claimed by China, is thought to hold one of the highest concentration of undiscovered resources within the SCS—764 million to 2.2 billion barrels of oil and 7.6 Tcf to 22 Tcf of natural gas.”
Apparently the play on the arbitration case, as it was being pushed for by Del Rosario, was for the Philippines to be able to push through oil and gas exploration without honoring the 2004 memorandum between the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) and China’s China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) issued under the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). The companies which have a stake in the service contract for exploration awarded by the Department of Energy include the groups of Manny Pangilinan, Ricky Razon and Bobby Ongpin. Shell’s 30% stake in Malampaya has been sold to Dennis Uy’s Udenna Group. As the gas reserves run out, what is of value is the infrastructure which is the pipeline that runs from the platform to Batangas where the LNG power generating plants are located.
It is obvious which group Carpio is lawyering for. But does Mareng Winnie make a valid claim that it was Ochoa’s Palace faction who were traitors? What of PNoy’s being clueless about the presence of Paul Reichler and Albert Del Rosario for a meeting? Why didn’t PNoy follow up with Ochoa personally? There is more than meets the eye in the perorations of Carpio. The question of then Senator Antonio Trillanes’s backchannel negotiations with the Chinese has never been answered as well.
The country’s energy security is imperiled again because of the fight for control of the energy supply. It is only Duterte who has been able to make the oligarchs toe the line which is why there is the effort to ensure that come 2022, neither a Duterte nor a Marcos should be President.",Politics
Desperate Opposition and dismal Robredo popularity amid rising Marcos numbers confirm fraud that cost Marcos VP win in 2016,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/desperate-opposition-and-dismal-robredo-popularity-amid-rising-marcos-numbers-confirm-fraud-that-cost-marcos-vp-win-in-2016/,"In his Inquirer piece “President Robredo”, Joel Ruiz Butuyan refers to a “political force” that, Buntuyan suggests, could include former supporters of President Rodrigo Duterte who are “completely disillusioned now, and don’t want his chosen candidate as his successor.” He also proposes that members of this political force “concede that Vice President Leni Robredo is our ideal next president” but are “predisposed not to vote for her because they doubt her winnability”.
Butuyan is probably referring to the growing middle which is the divide between the disillusioned among the pro-Opposition and the pro-Administration partisans who are described as persuadable. Their numbers haven’t been quantified in a survey yet. But what is a fact is the 21-45 demographic is a total of about 40 million Filipinos come May 2022 per the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) estimate. They are the largest bloc in a voting population estimated by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to be 60 million voters. Most of those who are running for or have declared their intent to run for President have been made aware of this by their core campaign staffers. But as one pollster told me last year, the problem with millennials and Gen-Zers is they’re not a reliable voter base because they cannot come up with a principled stand. This was evident in Robredo’s own statement where she claimed they had the support from this demographic but it didn’t translate into votes for victory in the 2019 midterm because they were either unregistered or didn’t vote.
For now, the Opposition seems to be pursuing a divide-and-conquer strategy. Split the Visayas-Mindanao vote which is the Duterte base and win in vote-rich regions in Luzon as the path to victory in 2022. The key to this strategy is Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao. However, judging by the reaction to his antics up to last week, the chances of his accomplishing the task the Opposition wants him to do is slim. Pac-Man continues to have the adulation and popularity but Filipinos know better than to vote for him as President. If there had been any palpable improvement in Robredo’s numbers in the last five years, I’d be inclined to give credence to this argument. The problem is there is none. This only reinforces the belief that former Senator Bongbong Marcos was cheated out of victory in 2016 since he is still polling in the top five be it for President or Vice-President. He would be a shoo-in if he runs for the Senate again.
The recent death of former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino has done nothing for the opposition. President Duterte declared a ten-day mourning period up to July 4. There was not much fanfare yesterday. There were more memes about the anniversary of independence from the Americans than what would be referred to in the vernacular as the “babang-luksa” for Aquino. Robredo herself has doubts about her winnability. She filed for a change in residence ostensibly because of the permits needed for the construction of a house for her siblings after they received their inheritance from their mother. But it is obvious that her fallback is to run as Governor of Camarines Sur. As Naga is a chartered city, its residents don’t vote in provincial elections.
It’s a shame the way op-ed columnists resort to fooling the public into believing a lie. There is nothing sincere about Robredo’s intentions. All along she has been playing a game. She is the political heiress of her husband and she isn’t the reluctant politician she proclaims herself to be. Perhaps, if she were more honest about her intentions, the public would have a better view of her. The basic problem of Robredo is she is more image than substance. She is Exhibit A for what covert narcissism is all about. It’s high-time that her feet start touching the ground again for her days in the limelight are numbered. If her province mate is to be believed, she doesn’t even have a lock on the governorship if she runs.
The Chief Political Analyst of Digivoice, Antonio Contreras, has released the results of their survey showing Robredo trailing in Region 5 if she runs for President. Her proxies in her hometown of Naga haven’t done much for their constituents. She herself has chosen to focus on other cities and municipalities where she can gain political mileage such as Cebu and the National Capital Region (NCR). Her criticism of the pandemic response in the Davao City local government unit (LGU) attracted an acerbic statement from Inday Sara “Daughterte” which she didn’t bother to reply to anymore. The truth is no political party in its right mind, would enter into an alliance or a coalition with the Yellows because their brand is a kiss of death to any election campaign. No one wants to admit it but the members of the Liberal Party and its allies, are all dead men walking. It’s about time they acknowledge this reality. The end is near.",Politics
Antonio Carpio’s lies about the South China Sea dispute cause false sense of nationalism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/antonio-carpios-lies-about-the-south-china-sea-dispute-cause-false-sense-of-nationalism/,"A more rational view of the game of chicken being played in the South China Sea is presented by Inquirer columnist and former Supreme Court Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban in his piece “The game of chicken and Scarborough”. Panganiban doesn’t criticize Retired Justice and leader of Opposition bloc 1Sambayan Antonio Carpio but the hints are there, particularly the jab about the United States still not being a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Claiming “freedom of navigation,” the United States (US) regularly dispatches a flotilla of aircraft carriers, warships, submarines, and warplanes to the SCS and ECS. Ignoring China’s self-proclaimed “nine-dash” line, the US conveniently justifies its actions by citing the Arbitral Award we won, though it was neither a party thereto nor a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
This is what Carpio is not telling the public. The US abides by its own rules which enables its rivals to do the same. It can’t always hide under the guise of freedom and democracy. Our location puts us squarely in the middle of any US-China conflict. Such a conflict would force us to take sides as we don’t have our own defense capability.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was neglected post the administration of Ferdinand bMarcos and it is only now that it has been given what it deserves in terms of equipment and compensation. Our defense capability is largely dependent on our fiscal position. We need to be as progressive as our ASEAN neighbors to have funds to purchase aircraft and warships for the country’s defense and the enforcement of territorial sovereignty.
The US has never given the country anything but the mutual defense treaty which is not an ironclad commitment. Talk is cheap. This has been proven during the Scarborough stand-off. The US didn’t even bother to pressure China into honoring the compromise agreement. The average Filipino should realize that what is being advocated by Carpio and his cohorts is a false sense of nationalism because it jeopardizes our interests more than it benefits us as a whole.
It’s good that former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay has finally come clean on what really transpired behind-the-scenes after the Scarborough stand-off. It is now on the record and it is up to Carpio to defend himself and his position, if he can.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s long-overdue EUREKA moment: “we” are not the “only” good guys!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/leni-robredos-long-overdue-eureka-moment-we-are-not-the-only-good-guys/,"It seems “vice president” Leni Robredo, presumptive “leader” of the entire “united” Philippine Opposition, had finally found it in her blessed heart to engage in a bit of inward reflection. Following the dud of an over-hyped “announcement” issued by Opposition coalition 1Sambayan Saturday, Robredo has come out with an apparent attempt to finally kill the failed good-versus-evil narrative of her camp. In his “report” that screams “Robredo urges supporters: Don’t think we’re the only ones who are good”, Inquirer “reporter” John Eric Mendoza provides the following English translation of Robredo’s statement which she “said in Filipino in ‘BISErbisyong LENI,’ her Sunday show on AM radio DZXL.”
“We are in this situation not because of just one person. It’s not just because of the president. We need to understand that,” she added. “We need to understand why many are attracted to the President. Why are so many attracted to this kind of politician? We need to recognize that.”
“It can’t be said that we are the only ones who are good — that, you know, we are the only ones who are sensible [‘matino’ was the term she used]. That cannot be,” she went on.
Welcome to the 2022 election campaign, Madame “vice president”. Perhaps Robredo’s small band of rabid followers can now recognise that winning an election is an exercise of addition and not subtraction. Under the leadership of the Liberal Party (a.k.a., the Yellowtards), the Opposition had, over the last five years since President Rodrigo Duterte’s ascent to power in 2016, habitually framed themselves as the “good guys”, effectively excluding the vast swathe of Filipino voters who disagree with this pompous self-appraisal or accord it mere bemusement.
The catastrophic loss of the Yellowtard-backed Otso Diretso coalition in the 2019 midterm elections demonstrated the fatal folly in this approach. Despite this, no lessons had been learnt. The video streamed by 1Sambayan last Saturday was marked by the very same election-losing themes — songs of Filipinos’ victimhood provided an annoying background din to grim images and video footage depicting the “casualties” of a purported conspiracy by state forces to murder Filipinos en masse. It is one thing that these tired claims that the Philippine government is a “fascist” state and, Duterte, a “tyrant” had long come across to most Filipinos as bratty cry-wolf sloganeering coming from a bunch of butthurt crybaby little girls.
One wonders who really failed the Yellowtards in their ineffective five-year campaign to demonise the Duterte government while they canonized their lot. Was it their public relations machine? Was it the legendary community of social media “influencers” who inflated social media Retweet and Share stats to the point of misleading their people into thinking they had the upper hand in the popularity contest? Was it their Big Corporate Media henchmen who eroded their brand equity by constantly making themselves and their celebrity “journalists” the stars of their own “news” stories?
Perhaps. But a lot of what contributed to the reduction of today’s Opposition to a sad punchline is on Robredo herself. Robredo, de facto face of the Philippine Opposition for the last five years, routinely conducted herself in a tone-deaf manner under the limelight and in front of a complicit broadcast media industry, often using disasters and human suffering as stages for her media whoring.
So, ok, the Yellowtards are no longer the only good guys in Philippine politics according to Leni Robredo. What then? There is still the job of crafting an inclusive platform and designing a campaign that seeks to convert voters instead of alienating them. More importantly, at a time when mounting traditional campaigns that involve a lot of face-to-face engagement and baby kissing is no longer possible, the battle for hearts and minds will be fought digitally. With that, will come immense opportunities to collect sentiment data and apply modern data science to its analysis. Seeing that the Yellowtards’ political machine has proven to be utterly incompetent at taking a modern approach to election campaigning it’s high time heads roll. The broader Opposition should start seriously considering whether Robredo’s head should be among them.",Politics
"WANTED: A new, better, and SMARTER Philippine Opposition",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/wanted-a-new-better-and-smarter-philippine-opposition/,"We need a new opposition. One that is constructive and puts partisanship behind after an election to work with the administration for the people. This is what the then opposition did when Noynoy Aquino came to power in 2010 but look at what happened. The typical Yellowidiot attitude of vengeance reared its ugly head again and Aquino went after his political opponents using his now infamous Secretary of Justice.
Despite their defeat in 2016 and again in 2019, they still haven’t learned. Professor Antonio Contreras, referring to the 1Sambayan June 12 announcement in particular, called them “pathetic” in his Manila Times column today.
I have said this before and will say it again. 1Sambayan and the political opposition is in a quandary because they committed seven deadly political sins. They have been exclusionary, purist, moralistic, elitist, failed to recruit newer and younger blood, refused to read opinion polls, and stuck it out with unwinnable candidates like [vice president Leni] Robredo.
There’s still the possibility that 1Sambayan will dump the two “nominees” they have left. It’s possible that they will get behind Isko Moreno or the Macho tandem of  Ping Lacson and Tito Sotto. At this point, whoever is left in the game are keeping their cards close to their chest under the excuse that there shouldn’t be politicking in a pandemic. But we can be sure that they’re moving behind-the-scenes and are in the process of building up alliances with the regional kingpins who can deliver the votes.
Note however, that no commitment is cast in stone as far as Philippine politics goes. Nationally-accredited political parties are mere flags of convenience now similar to vessel registries. It’s the regional political agrrupations which wield real power. These are the political dynasties which have come under scrutiny lately because of the Opposition who are equally guilty of perpetuating the same. We need to be pragmatic about structural reform in all aspects. Hopefully the 2022 election will have the public looking more at the issues rather than the personalities.
We can’t have Manny Pacquiao as President nor can we afford Willie Revillame in the Senate. Just look at the neophyte senators who won in 2016 and are up for re-election in 2022. We should go through their output as they will be the senior members after the current election cycle. We don’t have much to look forward to in terms of up and coming candidates because of the incestuous nature of our political structure.
We are at a crucial tipping point because of the pandemic. It cannot be business-as-usual in this electoral exercise. We need capable and competent leadership to navigate through the challenges posed by the present environment.",Politics
Regard for China-Philippines relations should move on from the old Yellowtard and communist “bully” rhetoric,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/regard-for-china-philippines-relations-should-move-on-from-the-old-yellowtard-and-communist-bully-rhetoric/,"Check out Richard Javad Heydarians’s most recent crybaby piece “Why are we bullied?” published on the Inquirer. Heydarian basically whines about “our President’s almost slavish comments vis-à-vis the Eastern bully, which has been creeping into our waters with increasing impunity.” He worries about the prospect (presumably as the 2022 elections loom closer and campaigning ramps up) of “lower-level officials and traditional politicians” suddenly “parroting the worst aspects of Dutertismo, not out of political conviction but out of pure expediency.” He then writes…
Far worse than staying silent in the face of infamy is trying to justify it. And here lies the Philippines’ ultimate tragedy—the stubborn grip of a ruling oligarchy that openly, and often even proudly, extols its subservience to global bullies. In any other self-respecting nation, no statesman would even dare to traffic in such brazen rhetoric of defeatism.
Where does Javad get the gall? It’s patently clear that his patrons are working for their own vested interest with the US behind their back. The same is true with Taiwan which the United States has provided modern military hardware with. The Philippines as a former colony, wasn’t so fortunate. All we have received are hand-me-downs. A policy of rapprochement is not defeatism but pragmatic. We can’t rely on the US for material military support. Would it be safe to assume they will go to war with China in the event of an attack on our shores?
Lucy Torres Gomez may not have the academic credentials Javad has but her pragmatic approach is more sound than any of his theories will ever be. Gomez had earlier reportedly “urged for sobriety in public discussions over the West Philippine Sea (WPS) as she raised economic concerns over calls for the government to be more aggressive in dealing with Chinese military vessels that have been spotted in various reefs inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).” In his piece “Enforcing the Arbitral Award” published on the Inquirer last Sunday, former Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban for his part detailed the steps which are needed to enforce the arbitral ruling. He starts by proposing that Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra “form a team of international jurisconsults, headed by him and Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.,” to study the challenge of bringing China before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the matter of our South China Sea disputes considering that “China had publicly declared that only the ICJ has the jurisdiction to settle our EEZ claims”.
This is better than Javad’s ally, Associate Justice Antonio Carpio who hasn’t propounded anything to this effect. The practical reality is China is now our largest trading partner for both imports and exports. Panganiban further points out…
As the world’s second largest economy (and soon, the first) with the biggest army and a huge nuclear arsenal, China will not readily give up its preferred mode of one-on-one negotiation where it enjoys absolute superiority, and agree to litigate as an equal in the ICJ.
The recent proposal of retired Justice Francis H. Jardeleza, et al., to identify “by name and coordinates at least 100 features being claimed and occupied by the Philippines,” will help in proving in the ICJ our territorial title to 35 HTEs in our maritime domain. For now, however, I expect China to ignore this proposal and to insist on its old “nine-dash line” tune.
What Justice Panganiban doesn’t say is that instead of the arbitration panel in the Netherlands, the issue should’ve been brought forth to the proper forum which is the International Court of Justice in Switzerland from the very beginning. Simply put, it wasn’t in the best interest of the US to do so. Then President Noynoy Aquino at the time was subservient enough to follow American dictates. Note that the US itself has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) because it would limit their ability to conduct freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the territorial waters of another country. The truth is, Carpio is lawyering for the vested interests in the country that have investments in the energy sector. This is all about the oil and natural gas deposits in the Recto Bank and not about sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea. This is why Aquino issued the proclamation naming it so and the Luneta hostage incident was the trigger to begin the hostility towards China.
Do we put everything at risk by taking a belligerent stand similar to that which Aquino adopted during his term? If not for China, who would sell the country vaccines in the quantities it needs to begin a return to a semblance of normalcy? Pragmatic is being practical which Javad is obviously incapable of.",Politics
"Bakit Tuwing Panahon ng Eleksyon sa QC, Dumarami Ang Kamaganak Mo?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/bakit-tuwing-panahon-ng-eleksyon-sa-qc-dumarami-ang-kamaganak-mo/,"“Ano bang kailangan mo at nagpapanggap kang kamaganak namin?”
Dahil sa hindi pinagbabawal ng Comelec ang pangangampanya ng mga politiko at gusto maging politiko kahit sobra pang layo ng official campaign period, naglipana na naman ang mga nagpapakilalang kamaganak ng kung sino-sino.
Ito ang isa sa pinakalaos na gimik ng mga kakandidato para sa kung ano anong mga posisyon.
Time pa ni “Tita Cory” Aquino ito nuong panahon ng 1986 snap election ito pinauso para daw mas madali siyang makilala at mapamahal sa masa. Mula noon, naging kagawian na ng mga politiko ang magpatawag ng tito, tita, kuya, ate, ninong, ninang, at kung ano ano pang mga karaniwang tawag sa nakatatandang kamaganak.
Grade 7 ako nuong nangyari itong 1986 snap elections at noon pa lang, mali na ang dating ng ganitong gimik sa akin.
Nuong kabataan ko kasi ng 1970s, pinalaki kami ng mga kapatid ko na tanging mga tunay na kamaganak lamang ang kinikilala sa tawag na tito, tita, ate, kuya, lolo at lola. Sa ibang mga nakakatanda na kaibigan ng mga parents namin eh karaniwang Mang o Aleng ang katagang inuuna namin sa mga pangalan nila bilang sign of respect.
Kung mas pormal ang sitwasyon, diyan lumalabas ang mga English prefixes tulad ng Mister, Miss, at Misses o minsan-minsan, kapag lola ko sa Quiapo ang nagpapakilala eh Senyor o Senyora.
Nuong panahon na iyon, kapag may kumatok sa pintuan ng bahay namin at nagpakilalang estranghero sa amin na “Tita” o “Tito”, tinatawag namin agad ang magulang namin. Usually, nanay ko ang humahalili at pinapapasok na kami.
Tatalakan ng nanay ko ang kung sino man ang estrangherong iyon at sasabihang, “Huwag kang masyadong pamilyar, di ka namin kamaganak. Ano ba ang kailangan mo at nagpapanggap kang kakilala namin?”
Sa panahon ngayon, sa halos lahat ng pagkakataon, madidinig mong tinatawag na tatay, nanay, tito, tita, ate, o kuya ang kung sino sino. Para bang wala nang pormalan talagang alam ang karamihan at masyado nang pamilyar ang lahat.
Gayunpaman, andyan pa rin ang katotohanan na sambit na nanay ko, basta’t masyadong pamilyar eh karaniwang may kailangan o kailangan ka lang goyoin.
Mga Pekeng Kamaganakan Mo sa Quezon City
Nitong nakalipas na weekend, pumunta ako sa Novaliches bayan para dumalo sa magkasunod na birthday ng mga kaibigan ko doon.
From Commonwealth, dumaan ako sa Jordan Plains subdivision at duon sa bukana nito napansin namin ang halos sunod-sunod na mga tarpaulin ng isang Rose Nono Lin na nagpapakilala na “Ate mo, Ate ko, Ate nating lahat. Ate Rose Lin ang Ate ng Distrito Singko.”
Sa halos five years ko nang madalas na pagbisita sa Novaliches, ngayon ko lang nalaman na may Ate pala akong Rose Lin. Hahaha!
Ang madalas kong makitang mga pangalan sa mga kalye ng Nova eh Susano, Asuncion, Visaya, Vargas, at Liban. Ito yung mga institution na sa politika ng 5th District ng Quezon City.
Nagtanong tanong ako sa mga friends ko sa Novaliches at mga karatig pook nito kung kilala nila itong Ate Rose na ito. Ito yung mga taong ilang henerasyon nang nakatira sa Novaliches. Ni isa sa kanila eh di nakapagsabing kilala nila si Ate Rose.
Saan banda ba daw nakatira sa 5th District si Rose? Baka daw bagong lipat lang yan.
Naalala ko tuloy yung parang biglaang pagtakbo ni Mike Defensor (isang haligi ng politika sa 3rd District ng Quezon City) bilang senador nuong 2007. Doon, siguro batay na rin sa advise ni Boy Abunda nuon, eh binansagan niya ang sarili bilang Tol at may campaign tag-line pa yan na Walking Tol.
Potek! Dami naming tawa nuon sa sulok-sulok ng HUDCC at Pag-IBIG Fund na pinamunuan nya bilang chairman nuong panahon ni dating Pangulong Gloria Macapagal Arroyo na nag-appoint sa kanya sa pwestong iyon.
Sa mga nakakakilala kay Mike o Boss Mike, medyo mage-gets ko ang pagkabansag sa kanyang Tol. Karamihan ba naman ng mga pina-appoint nya sa ilalim niya eh mga brad niya sa fraternity. Wala namang masama duon kasi magaganda naman ang qualifications nuon at dahil kilala nga nya ang mga ito dahil sa frat nila, eh malakas ang tiwala niya sa mga ito.
Anyway, di ako nakuntento sa pagtanong tanong tungkol dito kay Ate Rose Nono Lin para malaman ang katotohanan sa pagkatao nito. Kaya dumulog na ako sa tanungan ng buong mundo, ang Google at Facebook Search.
May nakita rin akong Instagram account na Rose Nono Lin. Kung siya nga itong nsa IG post na public na may kasamang dalawang bata at isang lalakeng kamukha ni Jack Ma ng Alibaba, abay naman… Kasarap naman ng bakasyon nila sa Palawan nung May 2015.
Meron din syang selfie sa IG kasama si Ogie Alcasid at isang nagnga-ngalang Meng Ronquillo na mukhang malapit kay 4th District Councilor Marvin Rillo.
Bukod diyan, rin ang Facebook Page na Ate Rose Lin at iba pang mga Facebook Account na may pangalan na Rose Nono Lin.
Sa Facebook Page na Ate Rose Lin, makikitang nitong taon lang ito ginawa at ang creation date ito ay nasa February 18, 2021.
Ang unang post ng page na ito ay February 18 din at sa post na ito makikita ang isang logo na may mga salitang Dragon De Fuego Holdings Company.
Nakasaad din na may related pages ito na Isko Moreno Official Supporters pero ang URL nito ay https://www.facebook.com/YormeIMD/ na nakakapagtaka. Si Yorme Isko kay kilala sa pangalang Isko Moreno at Francisco Domagoso, malayong malayo sa YormelMD.
Sino ang Yormel MD? Baka naman pinagsamang Moreno Domagoso. Pero pwede ring Mike Defensor, diba? Ang pangit pangit lang kung lalabas na sumasakay lang sa popularidad ni Yorme Isko ang page na ito tapos later gagawing Mike Defensor for QC Mayor ang page.
Nakita ko na yang before nuong 2009 kung saan ang memorial page ni Cory Aquino eh biglang naging page ni Pnoy. Ang laking panloloko sa taongbayan.
Isa sa pinakabong post ng page eh nitong June 12 lamang.
Abay… Napaka-active pala ni Ate Rose nitong nagdaan na Independence Day. Sa isang post ng Ate Rose Lin page, may makikitang isang babae na namimigay ng sobre na may mukha niya.
Wow! Ano kaya laman ng sobreng yan?
Nakoh… Mukhang alanganing gawain yan Ate Rose.
Kung sabagay, wala namang politiko o magpopolitiko na nakulong na dahil sa vote buying.
At gayon nga na sabi naman ng Comelec na okay lang ang mangampanya kahit wala pa tayo sa official campaign period, tingin ko OKAY LANG itong pamimigay ng sobre na may mukha at pangalan. Sabi nga ng Comelec, BASTA WALANG KATAGANG “VOTE” HINDI ITO ILIGAL.
May video rin si Ate Rose kung saan waring pinapakilala niya sarili niya.
Bagamat marami siyang sinabi bilang pagpapakilala, nakalikha ito ng mas maraming katanungan tungkol sa pagkatao niya.
Galing daw siya sa mahirap… pero nakapagtapos ng kolehiyo.
May negosyo daw siya, pero hindi sinabi kung ano itong negosyo na ito.
Hindi pinakilala kung sino ang mga magulang at kapatid. Kahit asawa eh hindi pinakilala, which is karaniwang ginagawa ng mga politiko. Masama man pakinggan, pero pinagmukha syang putok sa buho ng sarali niyang video.
Abay, Ate ROOOOOSE LIN… NAPAKAHIWAGA MO NAMAN!
Itong mga tipong biglang pagpapakilala tapos may pabigay-bigay pa ng ayuda, halos tiyak na tanda na may hahangarin na posisyon sa pamahalaan. Kaya di dapat maituring ito na sincere o tunay na pagtulong sa nangangailangan, ITO AY SUHOL sa madaling sabi.
Kung bahagi man si Ate Rose ng bagong sibol na Malayang QC, tanungin sana niya sarili niya kung paano matatawag na MALAYA ang taong sisingilin ng UTANG NA LOOB?
Ang pangit naman isipin na ang tingin ni Ate Rose sa mga taga NOVALICHES at mga karatig pook nito eh mga BAYARAN.
Kalimitan, kung anong tingin ng tao sa sarili niya, yun rin ang tingin sa kapwa niya.",Politics
"No matter what the Opposition say, what Filipinos personally see as Duterte’s achievements WILL stick",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/no-matter-what-the-opposition-say-what-filipinos-personally-see-as-dutertes-achievements-will-stick/,"For sure the National Artist for Literature will cop flak again for his latest column on why President Rodrigo Duterte MAY YET BE THE BEST PRESIDENT THE COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD AFTER MAGSAYSAY. I put that down in ALL CAPS so morons will see it and hopefully be cognizant of the colatilla of F. Sionil Jose in his judgment of the President. In “Why Duterte” published on the Philippine Star, Jose starts with the bottom line which, ironically, doubles as a call to action for the Opposition…
It is so obvious now that whatever his critics say, or whatever hosannas his admirers heap on him, doesn’t matter because he has the people in the palm of his hand. What political and social analysts should do is to find out how he did this.
It is easy to get swayed by the propaganda being churned out by the hypocritical Opposition. I had a meeting yesterday with an individual whose identity I cannot reveal. He went on for close to two hours about how his principal should be the next President of the Republic. As I’ve stated repeatedly, I’m a political pragmatist. I swear no allegiance to any ideology or party. What I look at are platforms and outcomes. I don’t need to repeat what the National Artist has elaborated on as Duterte’s achievements during his term. Yes, he will fall short on his promises and the expectations of the public but it is safe to say that the public who support him see what he has done for the good of the country. He didn’t embrace the flag for show but he quantified his love of country in what he set out to do on Day One of his Presidency.
Duterte will bow out soon enough but not without the possibility of his running as Vice-President to his daughter, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte. Hindi ito Davao. Wala na bang iba? Sila lang ba ang magaling at may karapatan? We have heard all of these from the Opposition last Saturday, June 12, during the 1Sambayan announcement non-event. That was an exercise which was doomed to fail even before it began. The Opposition never learned from 2016 and 2019. They will not learn in time for 2022. What the esteemed national artist missed out on is the need for a new Opposition. One that is mature enough to set aside differences after an election cycle and work for the common good of Filipinos. This is not impossible to do if one is genuine and sincere in motive. We need a legitimate fiscalizer to keep watch for the public interest because the adage that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is true.
What the National Artist said about the oligarchy is true. But the fact is, they are still in power and the only way to curb their power is to open up the economy to foreign direct investment. As Jose said, Cory didn’t strengthen democracy. She weakened it with the 1987 Constitution. In the midst of the pandemic, where the only certainty is uncertainty, it is time to amend the Constitution. It is time to abolish and old political structure and replace with a more responsive and efficient system where equality and equanimity stand a chance of being institutionalized for every Filipino. It is only now I realized that in life, you start out with your dreams and then reality hits you hard in the face and you become pragmatic. But as I begin the twilight of my existence it is not impossible to dream again of a better future for the Philippines.",Politics
Opposition renews brouhaha over ICC “drug killings” investigation after embarassing June 12 @1Sambayan fiasco,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/opposition-renews-brouhaha-over-icc-drug-killings-investigation-after-embarassing-june-12-1sambayan-fiasco/,"Opposition “thought leaders” argue “if you’ve got nothing to hide then you’ve got nothing to fear” referring to the renewed hype surrounding the International Criminal Court (ICC) inquiry into “drug war killings” it alleges Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte perpeterated. They miss the point, however. It’s not that the Philippine government has anything to hide. In fact, it makes no effort to hide anything and it’s not as if anything can really be hidden in the Philippines where Asia’s most free press is King of the Airwaves and social media.
It seems that the Opposition is back to its old tricks stirring up anti-government outrage fads after the fiasco last Saturday that saw top Opposition coalition 1Sambayan fall flat on its face after candidates snubbed its so-called “endorsement”. The ICC is nothing more than a Mickey Mouse Court that picks on Third World countries. In giving it the one-finger salute, Duterte is showing the world that Third World countries need not put up with the veiled imperialism that former colonial powers wield using so-called “international criminal courts”. The fact is, the Philippine Supreme Court is the highest court in the Philippines. It remains functional and is doing its job as the final authority on the interpretation of Philippine law.
Clearly, the Opposition have not learnt any lessons at all. The style of “opposition” encapsulated by 1Sambayan — replete with tiresome highlighting of Filipino “victimhood” backdropped by annoying breathy acoustic “protest” ballads — no longer captures the imagination of Filipinos. That Opposition “thought leaders” would look to a foreign “court” that is a mere figment of the West’s former place as arbiters of “global justice” proves their ironic beholdenness to the former colonial powers that they claim to detest (if we are to believe the messaging in their protest rallies).
What the Opposition should be focusing on, specially now as the 2022 elections loom closer, is a forward-looking altnernative narrative to the Duterte Way. They are wasting their time on an international body the charter of which simply flies way above the heads of ordinary Filipino voters. They seem to be in denial that another catastrophic loss in a crucial national election is staring them in the face yet again. Foreign intervention, whether it comes from assurances of “solidarity” from Hollywood (or Washington DC) celebrities or kangaroo foreign courts seem to be really potent opiates the Opposition would rather partake in than step up to the more important job of crafting an intelligent opposition platform.
It is evident that Filipinos have had enough of the dishonest Opposition we see today — one whose members contradict their own pretenses of “nationalism” by working with foreign interventionists instead of channeling their “cause” through their own country’s democratic institutions and processes. The numbers tell the true story — numbers that the Opposition, like an alcoholic who won’t admit her alcoholism, simply refuse to come to terms with.",Politics
Why does selecting a Philippine president have to be so hard?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/why-does-selecting-a-philippine-president-have-to-be-so-hard/,"Who were our best President’s who never were. At the top of my list is Juan Ponce Enrile (JPE). To my mind, he is the only Filipino qualified to head all three branches of government. Next is former Ambassador Eduardo Cojuangco Jr (ECJ) for his business acumen and genuine devotion to agriculture. No one else comes after these two. I’ve written about men with gravitas in a past article and these two definitely are men with gravitas. Duterte is a man with gravitas which is why he became President. The bisaya bugoy-bugoy probably had his parents turning in their graves on May 9, 2016. Does current vice president Leni Robredo have gravitas? Former Senator Antonio Trillanes? Senator Grace Poe? Manila Mayor Isko Moreno? Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao? Senator Ping Lacson? Probably Lacson if given the opportunity but I question his becoming a fugitive when an arrest warrant was issued against him during the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) administration. When you compare him to JPE who was arrested after the 1989 coup attempt and Danding, who came back from his US exile even if he didn’t have a passport, Ping pales in comparison.
The elephant in the room is Davao City Mayor Inday Sara “Daughterte” Duterte. Does Inday have gravitas? Probably. The Presidential daughter largely minds her own business but is politically-savvy. Witness how she engineered the coup against then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez. Even the President had no idea it was going to happen or, even if he did, he couldn’t stop it. She exhibited her political mettle again in the term-sharing issue between Lord Allan Velasco and Alan Peter Cayetano. Result? She had her way again. This time it had Presidential sanction. Cayetano backed down after the President threatened to send troops in. Where is Cayetano now? Kangkungan. Frankly, if we want better leaders we should adopt or put in place a culture of excellence and do away with that of mediocrity. Government officials don’t act with a modicum of a sense of urgency because they are too complacent. What we have now are politicians who subscribe to the maxim of fake-it-until-you-make-it. Social media condones and promotes this. The proof is Isko. In less than three years he has become a Presidential contender all because of social media. While he has taken up certificate courses abroad, Isko hardly has the same kind of gravitas as JPE does and ECJ did.
Singapore should be our model in the development of leaders. Not only are they qualified in terms of academics but they are also given rigorous on-the-job training in government in both the executive and legislative roles. We should also do away with our flair for the dramatic. Narratives are easily spun. This is also part and parcel of the fake-it-until-you-make-it maxim. It cannot be form over substance because the latter always trumps the former. The danger is already there. We are on the verge of running out of the next generation of leaders if you go by what we have in Congress and the Senate at present. This is why constitutional amendments are urgently needed.
In his PhilSTAR piece today “Choosing a president”, Andrew Masigan writes…
At the heart of the problem is our flawed system for vetting a president. Unlike other democracies whose presidential candidates are selected through a series of caucuses and primary elections within political parties, presidential candidates in the Philippines are selected by the party seniors based on their winnability. Little regard is given to their capability or platform. Exacerbating matters is that the leaders who influence our votes – our senators, congressmen and local government officials – support candidates not based on qualifications but based on who best serves their political interest. We end up with presidents who are the best in political horseplay, but not necessarily the best as leaders.
The present political structure promotes mediocrity. Singapore has been able to maintain its growth track because of consistency of policies. Enabling laws are filed and passed because Cabinet ministers are also members of parliament resulting in less bottlenecks. It is high-time that the 1987 Constitution is amended or junked en toto because it is the albatross around our collective necks which continues to drag the country down. If we want to move forward at this crucial point where we are in the midst of a pandemic, now is a good time to take radical action to contend with the disruption.",Politics
"PDP-Laban circus leaves Manny Pacquiao a political orphan, possibly split Duterte admin camp",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/pdp-laban-circus-leaves-manny-pacquiao-a-political-orphan-possibly-split-duterte-admin-camp/,"Where will Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao, the political Peter Pan land in the aftermath of the PDP-Laban national assembly on July 17 where his ouster is certain? Definitely not the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) of former Vice President Jejomar Binay. If he’s not able to mend his rift with President Rodrigo Duterte then in all probability he will end up with the Reporma of Congressman Bebot Alvarez. Lito Banayo, writing for the Manila Standard, describes the situation as “Messy”.
It all began when Sen. Koko Pimentel, son of the party’s founder, decided to relinquish his presidency in late 2019.  He transferred the leadership, akin to a CEO where the chairman hardly involves himself in day-to-day affairs, to his fellow senator, Manny Pacquiao.
It just so happens that the chairman of the party is no less than the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Roa Duterte, who has been an on-and-off member or a local ally of the PDP-Laban, his Davao City-based political party at times in alliance with the party of Koko’s father, the late Aquilino “Nene” Pimentel.
The sidebar to the election is the grudge match between Inday Sara “Daughterte” and Bebot. In 2019, Alvarez defeated all of Daughterte’s candidates under Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP). While there was no reaction from the Presidential daughter, she does not take defeat very well. Alvarez’s “We Need A Leader” movement didn’t really takeoff as planned because it was poorly organized after it was overtaken by the onset of the pandemic. According to a source, there is supposed to be a meeting this week between Alvarez and candidates who are looking at a Presidential run.
There are other realignments which are under negotiation now that Congress is in recess until it reopens with the President’s last State of the Nation Address (SONA). There is the PDP-Laban national assembly on July 17. By then, the fates of Senators Pacquiao and Koko Pimentel will be known. Both may be ousted which leaves the President in control of PDP-Laban or worse, it splits into two factions which presents a problem similar to what the Liberal Party went through when Mar Roxas initiated the process of consolidation for his 2010 Presidential run.
After July, there are only three months left before the deadline for the filing of certificates of candidacy in October. There is a lot of work to be done in terms of finalizing Senatorial lineups and alliances at the regional and local level with the political kingpins. By September, we should have a clear picture of who will be the protagonists for the national posts. The political temperature will continue to rise until the last two weeks before election day on May 2022.",Politics
Philippines running out of qualified leaders because current system encourages stupid politicians,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/philippines-running-out-of-qualified-leaders-because-current-system-encourages-stupid-politicians/,"Political reforms aren’t forthcoming any time soon. The perfect opportunity to institute them was just after the 1986 “revolution” when Cory Aquino established a revolutionary government after she was installed as President. Unfortunately, this was wasted because the commissioners to the Constitutional Commission basically reinstated the political system in place before the 1973 Constitution was ratified. There were no objections raised to what amounted to the wholesale dismantling of the political structure because the allies of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos were the subject of witch-hunts which had them defending themselves against the immense power of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) which could simply issue a writ of sequestration without question and due process being accorded the person or the juridical entity.
The two-party system in place after 1946 had a revolving door in between. Defectors from either party formed a single file in each direction; in and out. That didn’t work either because Congress proved to be the stumbling block to any reform-minded President. This was Marcos’s frustration which was why he organized the 1971 Constitutional Convention. The result was a parliamentary system after the French model with the President as the Head of State and the Prime Minister as the Head of Government. It can be concluded that Marcos wanted this adopted because he could stay in power longer and nominate his successor. Unfortunately, the global economy was not ideal for the economic strategy he pursued. The oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 put the US in stagflation and the Philippines was in hock with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (IMF-WB) for development funds. The political opposition made the situation worse with the assassination of former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. in 1983.
In his Inquirer piece “The reform we need”, Cielito Habito laments how the Philippines’ political parties “are not solid organizations grounded on principles, but loose groups mainly built around personalities.” Changing this situation is difficult under the present system. Habito points out “the stark reality in Philippine politics” where “only candidates possessing large sums of money could ever stand a chance of winning political office”.
The ideal, of course, is for political parties to be democratic public institutions upholding a firm and distinct set of values and philosophies, based on which voters can form reasonable expectations on what their leaders would stand for once elected. There should thus be no place for political turncoats or “balimbings.”
We have seen the results of the 1987 Constitution on the present political landscape. We are running out of qualified leaders. The political benches of both sides are shallow. What we have now are mediocre legislators who have no idea what they’re doing because they lack the experience and qualifications necessary for public office. Just look at the potential candidates for President and Vice-President. Then look at the present crop of future leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives. There isn’t any one rising star you can pin your hopes on because no one has even come close to the level of a Juan Ponce Enrile or Miriam Defensor Santiago when it comes to governance. There is also no one like Serge Osmeña who, despite not having a college degree, was intelligent enough to actively participate in the affairs of the Senate. Imagine how in this election cycle, the senior members of the upper chamber would be Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla. Not exactly the ideal when it comes to leading an august body with a history of men with gravitas.
History has a way of making the public realize the deficiencies in the system. The post-Marcos history of the Philippines is about to end — if today’s Opposition is wiped out in May 2022. But our biggest problem is we will be left holding the bag in terms of their acts of omission and commission. The public was fooled into believing they were the good as opposed to Marcos being the devil incarnate. To this day, the jury is out on Marcos because history is not yet done with him or the Opposition. The true reckoning is about to come on May 2022. Thus our biggest problem is how do we move forward specially at a time when we are in the middle of a global crisis where the only certainty is uncertainty.",Politics
"Attention Ph Opposition: Show us INTELLIGENT alternatives, or LOSE in 2022",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/attention-ph-opposition-show-us-intelligent-alternatives-or-lose-in-2022/,"The nitty-gritty. Voter preference can be broken down extensively now because the technology is there. But it does not make much sense to do so because it all boils down to no-brainer hot-button issues that the majority of the public is concerned about. In a pandemic environment, it is about survival.
When in survival mode, people tend to be more conservative, less open to diversity, more suspicious of novelty, and more inward-looking — the latter, in the Philippines’ setting, translating to an increased focus on family interests and security. They are also likely to favour strong — even iron-fisted — leadership. Because the pandemic limited choices, choice and diversity of options becomes less-important and clear direction more paramount.
It is also about the future — a digital dystopia that is already here. The pandemic has disrupted First World approaches to the point that there is accelerated deployment of artificial intelligence and machine-learning. This has an impact on employment as unskilled work are the low-hanging fruits picked off by the early waves of an AI takeover. On the other hand, increased digitization may also enable government to reduce corruption and cut red tape and, as a result, improve its delivery of basic services.
Education also has been disrupted. We cannot move forward with a Department of Education (DepEd) that refuses to accept the reality that our learners are running behind global standards. High quality education is critical in a democracy where enormous power is in the hands of young people. If the youth are intellectually unequipped to worked that power, the quality of their government and politics will reflect that gap. This is evident in the politics and politicians Filipinos are subject to today.
What is ironic is that candidates who have signified their intent to challenge the incumbent are still in the dinosaur age of politics. They are still employing old tactics. Data-driven decision-making should be the linchpin of any campaign in this election cycle. It is too early to break down the electorate into liberal and conservative as “Chief Political Analyst” Antonio Contreras attempts to do in his Manila Times piece today “Invisible and unarticulated ideologies: Divisive issues and voter preference”. The professor’s data (which likely was collected at significant cost) reveals what any cluey political observer with a good ear on the ground could have told us way back…
As shown in Table 1, the results of the PINASurvey conducted by DigiVoice show that majority of the respondents agree with the death penalty (62.3 percent) and lowering the age of criminal responsibility (53.3 percent), even as only a minority favor the legalization of medical marijuana (30.6 percent), same-sex marriages (30.9 percent) and abortion (5.6 percent). These suggest that Filipinos, as represented by the respondents, tend to be more conservative on these issues. However, Table 2 shows that the majority support media freedom (67.3 percent) and only a minority support the position that communists are terrorists (27.3 percent). So, on these issues, Filipinos tend to be more liberal in orientation.
The 21-45 bracket is 40-million-strong. With traditional campaigning an impossibility, the candidates will have to use the platforms at their disposal to reach voters. The messaging has to be tailored. The divide-and-conquer strategy may work but why settle for a plurality when you can have a majority? Politicians shouldn’t waste this opportunity.
The future of the country moving forward is at stake. If the voters aren’t presented with a viable alternative, they will likely go for the incumbent. It’s a reality that the debates set the trend because that is how voters gauge their candidates. Surveys are guides. They are not the roadmap to victory.",Politics
Opposition SPOOKED by a possible Digong 2022 VP run because they know he will likely WIN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/opposition-spooked-by-a-possible-digong-2022-vp-run-because-they-know-he-will-likely-win/,"Mareng Winnie is slipping. You’d think she would have learned a bit about political theatre since the time that she ran for the Senate in 2001 and lost. She also dropped the ball with her defunct public affairs program on GMA with Oca Orbos and what she has running now — or has that been cancelled as well?
In her Inquirer piece today “Why he’s running for VP”, columnist Winnie Monsod “googled the number of times President Duterte talked of resigning from the presidency” and, guess what, found that “not a year has passed since 2018 that he hasn’t talked about resigning”. So, Mareng Winnie thinks out loud, “now he is agreeable to run for the vice presidency (“it is a good idea”) as requested/implored by his party-mates, so that, as they reasoned, he could continue the government programs he has started.” This leads Monsod to wonder out loud to her readers… “Mr. Duterte no longer tired and unhappy and frustrated, as he himself declared? Is he physically and mentally better off now?”
So much for any semblance of useful political insight from our revered “thought leaders”.
With less than a year left, the Opposition continues to dance to Duterte’s tune. You would think they would’ve learned their lesson by now. There is a cognitive dissonance among them who have the ideal or stereotype President in their heads against what Duterte actually is. He already said several times that he is not a statesman. He has a Mayor’s mindset. The Opposition then responds that the Philippines is not Davao but the former Mayor of Davao runs the country like it is one big city.
Monsod claims Duterte has achieved nothing. There is plenty to see. It’s just that they don’t want to. There is tax reform, infrastructure development and increased spending for social services. The economy was doing well until the pandemic struck. Other countries are in the same boat, even the developed ones. Monsod just does not want to acknowledge these. As far as violating the Constitution goes, the Edsa 2 ouster of then President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2001 is Exhibit A. That was a constitutional violation because Erap did not resign. Davide invented “constructive resignation” as the justification.
If Duterte runs for Vice-President with Senator Bong Go as President and they win, Go’s resignation paves the way for Duterte to succeed him. Succession is the operative word not reelection. In case Mareng Winnie forgot, it’s still up to the people who they vote for. It falls within the aegis of democracy. The Opposition is just piqued with Duterte’s audacity. No good boxer telegraphs his punches. The Opposition did not see this coming which is why they are seething. So much for the dumb promdi from Davao. Duterte has them all incensed and confused.",Politics
"Looming Isko Moreno candidacy for president in 2022, observers speculate on his possible running mate",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/looming-isko-moreno-candidacy-for-president-in-2022-observers-speculate-on-his-possible-running-mate/,"Inquirer columnist and former Communications Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) gives a political timeline for candidates and the public alike in his piece today “Why ‘pre-campaigning’ is necessary”…
While officially speaking, Feb. 8-May 7, 2022, is the official campaign period for national positions, and March 25-May 7, 2022, is the official campaign period for local elections, in truth for national candidates from the presidency to the Senate, they only have from Feb. 8 to March 25 to actually be campaigned for, by local allies: because starting March 25, it’s every candidate for him/herself as the local races kick off and monopolize the time, attention, and resources of the local candidates.
MLQ3 describes the period we are in until October as one marked by “what’s called ‘consciousness-raising’—activities meant to raise awareness of, and excitement/interest/support for, potential candidates: to make it worth the while of all sorts to buy-in and chip-in, to a potential candidacy.” Indeed, we have been seeing the ratcheting up of intensity in the horse trading and backroom negotiations over the last several weeks all of which will continue to ramp up. Several pundits have weighed in on possible presidential tandems for the 2022 elections. So far, the only viable one seems to be Senator pair Ping Lacson and Tito Sotto — if they do announce. President Rodrigo Duterte is still playing the game of political chicken. This keeps the rest of the field befuddled because indecision comes into play, specially if he runs for Vice-President, where he would be a shoo-in and automatic gadfly if an “opposition” President wins.
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is supposedly running. The question is with who? The Isko for President movement has Tim Orbos as lead convenor. If he does run, the Liberal Party pragmatists will likely support him, even if he doesn’t like it. He can’t afford to welcome them under his wing because that would be the kiss of death. Another complication is the National Unity Party (NUP) has announced they will renew their coalition agreement with Hugpong ng Pagbabago. Isko is with the NUP. Which political party will he use as his flag of convenience?
The split in the Liberals is a headache for Vice President Leni Robredo. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes is also limited because of his libel conviction. The Robredo loyalists will be left with few options because they would be hamstrung by funding and machinery at the ground level. Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao, if killed out by PDP-Laban, has the option of joining the Reporma of Bebot Alvarez. This makes a Lacson-Pacquiao ticket possible. But what if Pac-Man is made to run with the only goal of splitting the Visayas-Mindanao vote and act as a stumbling block for Duterte or Daughterte? The Villar Nacionalistas could also break from the ruling coalition if patriarch Manny thinks it’s worth the gamble. Mark Villar could be Isko’s VP as was thought of by political observer Doy Santos. But is it really worth the risk considering in six years the value of your real estate holdings have appreciated given the control over the road alignments of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)?
The way it’s looking for the administration, it’s options are either an Inday Sara “Daughterte” – Bongbong Marcos or a Marcos-Duterte tandem. In a three-way race with Isko and Lacson leading the other tickets, anything can happen. The slight edge of the administration is negated because of the 21-45 demographic composing the 40 million bulk of the voter population. The threshold for a win is between 16 million to 18 million votes.",Politics

The option has always been there but no one has bothered to test it until Duterte. Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) ran for Congress after her Presidency. This was largely ballyhooed by the Opposition but there was nothing illegal about it. The same is true with Duterte showing intent to run as Vice-President. He only needs a political party as a flag of convenience. He can win on his own as he did in 2016. The counter argument to be made is he can be a gadfly to the President who wins but it’s not within his nature to take an uncalculated political risk. He was in the 2016 race to win and he did in his own way on his own terms.
In a conversation with a GRP colleague last night, we analyzed the situation. Marcos wasn’t from the elite when he became a politician — provincial elite at best as his family was known in Batac. But, outside of Batac, Marcos was unknown. He would only rise to prominence when he ran for Congress and later Senator.
The environment in which Marcos won the Presidency in 1965 was different. In the present, the Philippines has 109 million Filipinos with more than half of them at voting age. There is the emergence of the new middle class; overseas Filipino workers (OFW) families who enjoy material wealth because of above-average incomes from working abroad. These are the masa who have moved up in the social rung of society. But their value system is still masa-based and Duterte appeals to them because of his promdi projection.
Duterte understands that continuity is needed to maintain the gains under his administration — “equilibrium” he said in his statement. The fate of the country depends on the power blocs that continue to support Duterte. On the opposite side of the political fence are those who are marginalized because they are out of power. But their main problem is they don’t have much to show for during the 30 years they were in power. Duterte and GMA are both septuagenarians but they still have what it takes to be leaders with gravitas.
There is, however, also room for an alternative to emerge — one who sees the niche in the middle between the two narratives which naturally evolved from the political division which began in 1986. This is why history’s jurors are still out with their judgement on the Marcos period in the country. It took twenty years before there came a President — Marcos — who did what needed to be done right after World War II. The Philippines had always been the leader in democratic initiatives in the region but it has almost always failed to progress because the root cause of the plantation-style political structure has never been addressed. That fundamental social problem persists to this day.
We are not privy to what goes on in the heads of GMA and Duterte but, surely, they have their respective ideas for what comes next. The Opposition, for their part, continue to be stuck in their old narrative. Instead of admitting their mistakes of the past, they continue in their belief that they did right and the public will gravitate back to them. Unfortunately for them, this is no longer the case. Their exploitation of former President Noynoy Aquino’s death ended just as quick as it began. Only their diehard supporters were nostalgic. The general public did not respond to the appeal to emotion because they made that mistake when his mother former President Cory Aquino died in 2009 and Noynoy became President despite his lackluster record as Congressman and Senator.
It is up to the worthy challenger to put forth a disruptive platform which will make an impact on the public. Otherwise, the public will go for what they have seen works.",Politics
"President Duterte running for VP is perfectly legal, Opposition fails to propose a BETTER option",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/president-duterte-running-for-vp-is-perfectly-legal-opposition-fails-to-propose-a-better-option/,"I wonder what former Bayan Muna House Representative Teddy Casiño is describing as President Rodrigo Duterte’s “brand of authoritarianism” when what he has been ordering implemented is within the context of the 1987 Constitution. The rise of populism was fueled by neoliberal ideology to deliver on its promised gains in developed countries. The template is not applicable to Asia as it has been proven that “democratic” authoritarian regimes are the norm. Communism itself is only a label Vietnam and China both use. In effect, what has been adopted and modified is the Singapore template put forth by Lee Kuan Yew.
Casiño asserts that Duterte “exploited” the weaknesses of the “EDSA Republic” postulated by political observer Doy Santos in a previous tweet supposedly to implement that authoritarian state Casiño imagines is in effect today. He further asserts in a subsequent tweet…
After failing in his efforts to impose a “revolutionary government,” declare martial law nationwide, or prolong his rule via charter change, he is now down to his last card – running for VP and ensuring the win of his daughter Sara or aide Bong Go in the 2022 elections.
Not so fast, Teddy. Duterte’s toying with the idea of running for Vice-President is not prohibited, either expressly or implicitly, in the Constitution. It cannot also be prohibited in the context of political optics or tradition because Duterte is not one to conform to the same. In fact, he is a disruptor. Those who are preparing to challenge the administration in 2022 still don’t get this. If they don’t put forth a disruptive platform then they will most likely lose. Just as much as Casiño fails to step back and regard the big picture, Santos also remains fixated on historical frames that no longer apply today.
In response to Casiño, Santos suggests that “[the] EDSA republic’s neoliberal fixation on markets as the mode for social transformation obscured its founder’s/Ninoy’s original vision of Christian socialism, which emanates from Northern Europe.” To Casiño’s shrill theory that “the neoliberal agenda hijacked whatever progressive spirit there was in EDSA”, Santos adds his quaint lament that “[neoliberal] and progressive agendas inspire backlashes from the right due to the nihilistic materialism and break with the past they produce or advocate.”
Ok, let’s step back from that interesting pillow talk between the two members of the liberals’ brains trust. Be reminded that this administration is the only post-EDSA government which hasn’t been wracked by major corruption scandals. Cabinet secretaries have been fired early in its term. It had to contend with destabilization attempts from the Opposition in Congress and Islamic fundamentalists allied with drug lords in Marawi. It has increased spending on infrastructure development and social social services without plunging the country into debt. It continues to maintain a consistent fiscal policy even under the pandemic environment. What the two in the thread — Casiño and Santos — are missing is the transition that will take place if the administration candidate wins. The Yellows and Reds begin their descent into oblivion and the strongest among the challengers becomes the new opposition, which hopefully, will be a partner in nation-building while effectively fiscalizing the administration.",Politics
What REALLY happened in 2016: Why the proposed July 12 National West Philippine Sea Victory Day is based on LIES,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/what-really-happened-in-2016-why-the-proposed-july-12-national-west-philippine-sea-victory-day-is-based-on-lies/,"The South China Sea dispute has been in the news cycle ever since President Rodrigo Duterte announced a shift in Philippine foreign policy after he was sworn into office in 2016. It was one that would not be closely-aligned with the United States as the former colonial master but an independent foreign policy where the Philippines would be a friend to everyone but subservient to none.
Since then, it has been a continuing battle between the administration and the Opposition. The latter went on to make, as a cornerstone of its “opposition”, accusing the President of being a traitor and betraying the interests of the country he has sworn to protect and defend from enemies, foreign and domestic. We are not at war with China but the Opposition appears to want to drive the country into one.
Duterte has done away with his predecessor’s belligerent policy towards the regional military and economic giant that is China. His policy of rapprochement has led to warmer ties and a de-escalation of the tension-filled relations during the administration for former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III when there was a travel ban in place and Philippine banana exports were subject to quarantine before being allowed entry. This was the offshoot of the Luneta hostage-taking incident over which Aquino refused to apologise to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Worse, Aquino also did not speak on the telephone to Donald Tsang, which added insult to the injury and death of the Chinese nationals who were taken hostage.
It is only recently that there have been interesting developments in the issue, which were triggered by retired Senior Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio’s revelations about what went on behind-the-scenes during the filing of the arbitral suit against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, in his Inquirer column “Aquino and the arbitration against China” published right after the death of the former President. In that piece, Carpio wrote gushingly about how “the Philippines’ landmark victory against China in the South China Sea Arbitration” is “[one] of the enduring legacies of President Benigno Aquino III”.
Former Solicitor-General Florin Hilbay, broke his social media hiatus, by posting a detailed account of his version of events which portrayed both the former Justice Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario in a bad light. As it turns out, both had been pushing for joint-exploration and development of the potential oil and liquefied natural gas reserves to be found at Recto Bank, which is internationally-known as Reed Bank. The arbitral ruling was specific in its language that Recto/Reed Bank is Philippine territory and generates its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This may have been one of the true purposes behind the filing of the arbitral case against China.
Despite the massive infighting that this matter now mires the Philippine Opposition in, factions within the Yellowtard bloc (the members of which are partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) remain committed to propagating the lie. Two weeks ago, Yellowtard Senator Risa Hontiveros, filed Senate Resolution No. 762 which, the Inquirer “reported” then, “seeks to immortalize July 12 as the National West Philippine Sea Victory Day commemorating the country’s 2016 victory in the arbitral court against China and in honor of the late former President Benigno Aquino III, whose administration pursued the case.” A desperate effort at best. Hilbay’s revelations have all but unmasked the Carpio – Del Rosario tandem as working for vested interests. More than likely it is for Manny Pangilinan to whom Del Rosario has been closely-identified with even before he joined government as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Carpio’s former high-power law firm was known to be the legal brains behind the impeachment of then President Joseph Estrada. It was through brilliant legal machinations and power and influence-peddling that Manny Pangilinan was able to gain control of incumbent telecommunications company PLDT.
The other mystery in this long-running saga is the role of former Senator Antonio Trillanes as the back-channel negotiator with China. The Senator has never made public what exactly was the role he played. What he has admitted to is his trips during the crisis period when the Chinese fishing vessels, also known as their maritime militia, entered Scarborough Shoal together with their Coast Guard white ships, which triggered the standoff.
We were able to interview an individual who had access to a transcript of an off-the-record interview with Senator Trillanes. According to his his narration, the latter became the back-channel negotiator through the intercession of then Budget Secretary Butch Abad with President Aquino. Trillanes made known to Abad the Chinese government functionaries he met during his study tour in 2011. Trillanes gave the interviewers a verbal summary of the aide memoire he submitted to President Aquino after the standoff was resolved to the detriment of the Philippines. He was tasked to negotiate with the Chinese and report directly to then Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa. At the time of Trillanes’s involvement, there was a total of 31 fishing boats and Chinese maritime militia as well as 50 dinghies inside the shoal. There were also two Chinese Coast Guard white ships outside the shoal. The Philippines only had one Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) patrol vessels inside the shoal and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels outside the shoal. The timeline is detailed per the infographic below:
The timeline is consistent with the narrative given by Trillanes. The former Senator makes no mention of the names of the Chinese officials he was back-channeling with but official accounts quote him as dealing with China’s Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying. As it turns out, Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario, then Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia and Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell of the US Department of State, were also dealing with the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister on the same issue. Trillanes reveals that the Americans wanted the issue resolved before Aquino left for his scheduled state visit to the US. The US also did not want the standoff to deteriorate to the point of conflict because it was an election year and then President Barack Obama was running for a second term. The US did not want another conflict in its hands because Obama made a campaign promise to get American troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hilbay in his statement made very interesting revelations about Carpio. Trillanes, for his part, does the same with Del Rosario. As it turns out, Del Rosario fed the Philippine Daily Inquirer with two stories; the first was the headline with an accompanying photograph showing the Chinese flag planted on the shoal on June 19. Subsequently, he also fed a story to the Inquirer about a ramming incident where a Chinese fishing boat allegedly hit a Philippine banca (small outrigger boat). Trillanes himself received confirmation from the Inquirer as per his account. The ramming incident took place but it was not deliberate but more of an accident in nature. It also did not take place in Scarborough as the banca’s origin was Pangasinan, not Zambales, which is closest to Scarborough Shoal.
According to Trillanes, President Aquino’s instructions to him were 1) de-escalation of the tensions between the two countries and 2) the agreement to confidence-building measures between the two countries as indication of good faith. Trillanes claims that he was successful in both if it were not for the contrary actions of Del Rosario in Washington where he was in direct contact with Kurt Campbell. Where Trillanes was already able to get the Chinese to agree to a sequential withdrawal, Del Rosario reportedly bypassed both President Aquino and then Department of Transportation and Communications Secretary Mar Roxas, by ordering the withdrawal of the Philippine Coast Guard vessel at the shoal by communicating directly with the Coast Guard Commandant. Evidently, Del Rosario was quite powerful during the period he was a Cabinet member.
The last-ditch effort of the government was to “internationalize the issue” by bringing it up during the Association of Southeast Asian Natins (ASEAN) regional forum where all foreign ministers of ASEAN member countries would be present. The Philippine plea fell upon deaf ears. This was due to the Philippines being perceived as an interloper in ASEAN during the time of President Aquino because it was parroting US policy towards ASEAN instead of acting as one of the five founding members of the group.
The Philippines went on to file the arbitration case against China. Interestingly, the tribunal’s ruling on the Scarborough Shoal was “The second key finding in the case was that neither Scarborough Shoal nor any of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own” and “are therefore legally rocks for purposes of Article 121(3) and do not generate entitlements to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf” (paras. 643 and 646). This means that the only EEZs and continental shelves in the South China Sea are those generated by the coastlines of the surrounding states and, possibly, some of the Paracel Islands. The Spratlys and Scarborough Shoal “generate only a series of 12-nautical-mile territorial seas.” In short, the Philippines lost Scarborough Shoal in the end because the tribunal was silent on sovereignty. Instead, the shoal was pitched for the joint-exploitation of China and the Philippines. What then of Carpio’s fulsome praise for the Murillo-Velarde map, which Mel Velarde graciously purchased, to prove that the Scarborough Shoal or Bajo De Masinloc, as it was known during the Spanish colonial period, has long been recognized as Philippine territory?
Hilbay wrote in his statement on the matter, “On the other hand, Justice Carpio’s formal designation was, as he correctly pointed out, that of an ‘observer’ – he had no direct and formal relationship with President Aquino; was not officially part of the legal team which handled the case; and did not have any authority to speak for or bind the Republic, during arbitration. While his expertise on the matter is a given, as an observer, he had no skin in the game. And yet, he has somehow positioned himself as the voice on the West Philippine Sea case, with authority to make accusations and insinuations ex cathedra.” For the benefit of us who are not familiar with Latin legal terminology, ex cathedra is “with the full authority of office (especially that of the Pope, implying infallibility as defined in Roman Catholic doctrine.” In short, Hilbay challenges Carpio: Who died and made you King?
In the end, the Filipinos spent over one billion pesos for the arbitral case and still lost Scarborough Shoal in the process. But it was a win for Carpio, Del Rosario, and their principal, Manny Pangilinan. Philippine sovereignty was established at the Recto/Reed Bank. Pangilinan has announced he is looking at the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) as Forum Energy’s technical partner for oil and gas exploration in the same area. This, despite an earlier agreement signed between CNOOC and the Department of Energy (DOE) in 2003. A seismic survey was conducted after the agreement was signed during the Arroyo administration which became the basis for the awarding of the service contract by the DOE.
It would be safe to assume that the Administrative Order No. 29 renaming the territorial waters off the South China Sea within the Philippines EEZ as the West Philippine Sea, was also at the prodding of Del Rosario as the then Foreign Affairs Secretary. Think about it though. If there is a West Philippine Sea, why isn’t there an equivalent East Philippine Sea in territorial waters off the Pacific Ocean? The term does not make sense at all.
What is evident now is both Carpio and Del Rosario were not acting for and in behalf of the interest of the Philippines and Filipinos but for Manny Pangilinan and the Americans. The US became wary of China’s rise during the same period which had Obama announcing his pivot to Asia strategy along with a new free trade agreement, which ironically excluded the Philippines, but included the most favored manufacturing ASEAN member countries. The US is not a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but the arbitral ruling enables it to continue conducting freedom of navigation operations, including naval exercises in the contested waters.
The cabal of Carpio, Del Rosario, and Pangilinan expect to get away with murder at the expense of Filipinos in general, and Rodrigo Duterte, in particular. Duterte is just their convenient bogeyman. It is then no mystery at all why Pangilinan and other anti-Duterte oligarchs such as the Ayala’s and Lopez’s are ready to back Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso’s presidential run. Isko is malleable unlike Duterte who has a mind of his own as former President Fidel Ramos realized too late in the game.",Politics
"After “Achievement War,” Yellows fail to Prove that their Admin was “clean”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/achievement-war-yellows/,"The way the Duterte-Aquino “Achievement War” rolled a while back demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of political discourse in the country. Although I would hammer the Aquino side more, I maintain the point I made in my earlier article “Positive should never be used to cover the Negative Up” that achievements by politicians are not a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Both sides are throwing out achievement lists to try and show that their president is better. If you ask me, I’d trust Ben Kritz’s article that compares the two sides based on quality over quantity, giving the Duterte side a little advantage. But for me, no matter the achievements, corruption or any huge mistake will soil any record. Political leaders should be punished accordingly for those, or at least should not be heaped with high praises.
But here’s why I would hammer the Aquino side more: the Yellow side is more cultic. In my article on GRPSupport, BS Aquino Fandom reflects Starstruck Ignoramusness and Wokeness, I showed how the blindness of Aquino supporters continues to this day. They continue to insist that BS Aquino is an unblemished, faultless saint, even if so many lucid moments of callousness and in-your-face disrespect of others were recorded.
Opposition keeps harping on Duterte, or even Arroyo and other presidents, as evil (it’s obvious that they consider anyone not on their side as evil). On Duterte, they keep parroting the kwentong barbero (barber shop gossip) that he maintains a secret hit squad from his days as mayor, never mind that this cannot be tried in court without any proof (Let me also reemphasize that Aquino himself likely had his own private goon squad and may have ordered hits, as I mentioned in my GRPSupport article). Just that contrast, the Aquino fandom insists, justifies preferring Aquino over any other to the point of worshipping him.
I think Aquino worship is already the sign of a mental disorder, since people are willingly blinding their eyes to obvious signs. You may call Duterte worship like it, but I think Duterte was different in that he never pretended to be the good guy. The Aquino side was the devil who takes the guise of an angel.
But as I said, the problem with Filipinos is how they treat leaders as silver bullets. They think, choose the right leader for the job, the “born leader,” or the clean, faultless leader. The truth is, no such person exists. There is no such thing as a naturally “good person.” All people are on equal footing and do either good or bad at different times. And, as I said in an earlier article of mine, I more believe that the role of leaders, especially national ones, is perhaps overrated and that things move forward despite more than because of them. People should lead themselves.
It’s a given that any administration should come up with infrastructure and achievements. Praise is best kept to a minimum for anyone. It’s the foul-ups that are something to measure and to harp on, especially those of the ever-holy, uninsultable Yellow Saint.
I still think the Yellow Cult still wants to do the dumb thing called overthrowing government so that they could take over and maximize their gains. They should be denied that.
The Yellow Cult also believes in the baloney saying, “when you are neutral, you are actually siding with the oppressor.” I believe neutrality is a legitimate thing, and painting one side as “evil” is just a publicity ploy. There are no good or evil sides in politics, only vested self-interests vying with each other. The recent spat between Florin Hilbay and Antonio Carpio seems to prove this.
The said spat also seems to be a leftover of the Balay vs. Samar days of Aquino’s term. I wonder what other things would come up related to this. It would be interesting to see if this fully exposes the “good guys” as vested interests and bursts the Yellow Bubble for good.
I wonder if it is finally making some Yellow supporters ask themselves how could two anti-Duterte people quarrel. “How could they not put up a united front? They’re the good guys right? But wait… are they actually vested interests working for selfish gain?”
Truth hurts. But if you don’t accept it, it can hurt even more.",Politics
What does it take to beat a massively-popular candidate in an election? Simple: a DISRUPTIVE campaign platform!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/what-does-it-take-to-beat-a-massively-popular-candidate-in-an-election-simple-a-disruptive-campaign-platform/,"Glad to see Manila Standard columnist Lito Banayo share my opinion in his piece “The disruptor”. Anyone who wants to challenge the administration will have to be as disruptive as the incumbent. Banayo happily points out the winning formula at play again in these times of impending election campaign writing “[President Rodrigo] Duterte is once again the ‘disruptor,’ a role he played successfully in 2015 leading to his victory in 2016.”
But who will the disruptor choose?  The daughter disdains the PDP as a flag, and would rather cobble a coalition with GMA and her Lakas, plus virtually hollowed-out parties as the late Miriam Santiago’s People’s Reform Party.
The loyal assistant meanwhile is likewise being egged upon to run for president, even if he seems truly reluctant, and may accept a secondary role, as vice-president.
It looks like a replay of 2015.  Substitution shall be the weapon of choice in the forthcoming jousts.
I’m sounding like a broken record by constantly repeating that the old campaign norms don’t apply anymore since the landscape was altered by the promdi from Davao City. He continues to be disruptive with his threat to run for VP and his continuing advise to his daughter not to run for President. None of the challengers have presented a disruptive platform to the public. There is Vice President Leni Robredo with her motherhood statements. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes with his corruption exposés. Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao with his Ma-ney machine.
The Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto campaign floated the idea of running the country like a corporation in the same manner Singapore does. If they will pursue this then it would be best to spin-off the regions into separate business units. The tandem is silent on federalism and Constitutional amendments but moving forward in the pandemic environment requires disruption to counter the disruption caused by the pandemic. Think Schumpeter and his economic theory of creative destruction. You need to destroy first in order to create. Duterte may have had this in mind when he ran for President. He destroyed the political template. He destroyed the Office of the President in terms of how things get done. He is not a statesman but acts more of a Mayor but gets the job done.
Six years is too short for a good President. For the sake of argument, let’s just say that Duterte is a good President because the late former President Noynoy Aquino set the bar very low. Still you can’t discount the fact that it is not everyday you see a President threatening oligarchs on national television. It was usually the other way around in the past. Bottomline, it won’t be a business-as-usual campaign. The conductor is leading the orchestra and he continues with his disruption. Duterte is the black swan of Philippine politics. Much to the chagrin of the establishment.",Politics
Less than 11 months to go: Isko races against Inday Sara’s election machine while Lacson-Sotto pair gears up,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/less-than-11-months-to-go-isko-races-against-inday-saras-election-machine-while-lacson-sotto-pair-gears-up/,"Analysts are pointing out that the high — some describe it as “near perfect” —  88 percent awareness rating Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte registered in a recent survey needs to be regarded within the context of voter acceptability. In the case of Manila Mayor Isko Moreno who has a lower awareness score of 37 percent, he is showing in the survey as being potentially able to attract the vote of 54 percent of respondents (higher than his awareness score). Duterte, in contrast registered a voter acceptance rating of only 38 percent.
This is the voter conversion challenge. I wouldn’t read too much into this at this stage because we still have a bit to go before the election in May 2022. A lot of things can happen between now and then. Isko’s image has been established and burnished on social media. His track record as Mayor is only three years. Recall, in the lead up to the 2016 election, presidency was the last thing on then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte’s mind but when he decided to run, he put together a powerful and coherent strategy that appealed to voters. Still it wasn’t a slamdunk, so to speak. He was up against the formidable machinery of the administration which included government resources at their disposal. He didn’t even have a political party to begin with. No senatorial slate either. He had little support at the local government unit (LGU) level. But no political operator accounted for the impact of social media which Nic Gabunada exploited to the hilt, particularly the OFW vote. Tapang at Malasakit and Change is Coming became buzz phrases. What was thought of before as conduct unbecoming of a presidential candidate became the norm. Putangina talagang papatayin ko kayo.
Duterte showed his mettle in the debates as well. Isko can claim he is a harbinger of a kinder and gentler Duterte but his weakness lies in shortfall on intellectual chops. Duterte played the role of dumb hillbilly from the province perfectly. But inside that mind of his was his true nature; cold, calculating, probably even diabolical. He knew which buttons to press and how to best communicate with his audience. There is a bit of natural enmity between the Tagalogs and the Bisayas. Isko’s best shot at victory is bagging the National Capital Region (NCR) and balance Luzon. But there is the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem standing in his way. Ping has more experience and a track record to show for it. He can also step into the role of a kinder and gentler Duterte but with the same iron-fist.
Isko also does not have a running mate yet. A natural would be Grace Poe. It would be the Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ) fanbase against the Dabarkads of Eat Bulaga. That’s a good match-up. The question is, is Grace Poe willing to run? She’s on her second and last term in the Senate. If she loses, she can still serve out her term. If she wins, she’s the second highest elected official of the land. Would the risk be worth it? The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) also has a formidable political machinery at the local level. It also has the most number of returning Senators. If Lacson-Sotto makes it, it would already have a base to build on in both houses of Congress. What is definite is Isko will also have the support of leftist-militant groups. This can work both for and against him. This isn’t 2016 when Grace Poe ran with the Left on her side. Duterte has disrupted that narrative as well.
This is why data analytics will play a crucial role in this election cycle. Voter sentiment is the key to victory. The technology is there to collect, crunch and analyze data. Candidates should harness the full potential of this advantage. It’s still my opinion that Lacson-Sotto can pose the biggest challenge to the administration provided they run their campaign right.",Politics
"Lacson-Sotto tandem viable alternative to Duterte/admin camp in 2022, excellent Opposition leaders if they lose",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/lacson-sotto-tandem-viable-alternative-to-duterte-admin-camp-in-2022-excellent-opposition-leaders-if-they-lose/,"The break is official. A Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem it will be! Truth be told, this tandem has a clearer path to the Presidency than the so-called Opposition that continues to be in a state of shambles. Vice President Leni Robredo as titular head of the Liberal Party had done nothing to unite the Opposition so far. The same is true with 1Samabayan, which has now relaxed its selection process, with its statement that they are open to taking in Sen. Manny Pacquiao into their fold should he be nominated.
The Lacson-Sotto tandem would be a viable alternative for voters who don’t identify as Dilawan (loyal to the Aquinos and Cojuangcos) or DDS (“Duterte Die-hard Supporters”). No less than eminent political strategist, Malou Tiquia, has mentioned the significant number of both pro-Administration and pro-Opposition supporters who have become “persuadable” voters. This is an interesting niche to tap considering that the 21-45 demographic is 40M strong. Lacson-Sotto would be a kinder and gentler alternative to the Duterte brand of politics. Both candidates have a track record of experience in public office. Sotto focused on the Senate since his election and rose through the ranks learning the intricacies of parliamentary procedure even if he is not a lawyer. Lacson has also taken his legislative position seriously with a Master’s in Government Management from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila under his belt. He also has executive experience having been Provincial Director of Laguna and Isabela. He was also Cebu Metrodiscom Commander and Chief of Task Force Habagat under the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) during the Ramos administration.
The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) headed by Sotto is the oldest political party still in existence since 1992 when it was founded by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. for his Presidential run. The NPC boasts a vast national and local machinery in key provinces. It also has the most number of possible Senatorial candidates in the persons of Sen. Loren Legarda, Gregorio Honasan and Chiz Escudero. They are in addition to incumbent Sherwin Gatchalian. The NPC is also looking at adopting Senators Joel Villanueva, Migz Zubiri and Richard Gordon. Lacson and Sotto’s political experience also serves them well. One of the new members of NPC is Narvacan Mayor Luis Chavit Singson. Singson is the incumbent President of the Mayor’s League of the Philippines. This bodes well for the NPC in drawing and firming up support at the local level.
What the tandem needs now is a disruptive campaign platform that will convince the public that they are the better option against the administration in light of the same disruption caused by the pandemic. Foremost on the minds of voters are economic recovery, public health and education. Lacson understands what ails the bureaucracy having developed a reputation as the budget expert of the Senate specifically when it comes to pork barrel or lump-sum insertions. Sotto can use his experience as Senate President to become the consensus-builder between the Executive and the Legislative.
The duo hasn’t made public their platform yet as they have slated August 5 as the date of the announcement of their decision. But seeing as how Atty. Goyo Larrazabal has stated that the NPC will not be renewing its coalition agreement with Hugpong ng Pagbabago, it’s evident that Sotto has crossed his Rubicon. For all we know, 2022 could be a showdown between two candidates which works to the advantage of the public. A Lacson-Sotto defeat wouldn’t be a total loss as they can step into the role of the responsible and mature Opposition — one that is not a destabilizer but a more a fiscalizer in the public interest and, most important of all, a genuine partner in nation-building.",Politics
Uncommon courage marks how Ping Lacson and Tito Sotto stepped up to the call for a TRUE Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/uncommon-courage-marks-how-ping-lacson-and-tito-sotto-stepped-up-to-the-call-for-a-true-opposition/,"It’s not really the early-bird-catches-the-worm aphorism as Manny Dooc writes in his Business Mirror piece “The Lacson-Sotto tandem” which allies in the face of the Lacson-Sotto tandem but more of a calculated risk in taking on the daunting challenge of running for the two highest posts in the land. Dooc does make an important point nonetheless…
When others hem and haw and disavow any ambition to seek the top two positions only to make a complete turnaround when the filing for the candidacy begins, the Lacson and Sotto tandem is more forthright and open with their goals. Lacson had been there before. In 2004, he ran for president as an independent candidate when he was disowned by his own party, the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino. Despite being partyless, Lacson finished third garnering more than 10 percent of the total votes cast. He edged out Senator Raul Roco and Bro. Eddie Villanueva who wound up fourth and fifth, respectively, in that presidential derby.
Recall in 2015, the news cycle was occupied by candidates who wanted to get then President Noynoy Aquino’s anointment. There was Grace Poe and Alan Peter Cayetano in the headlines. The former because of the case questioning her citizenship while the latter was jockeying to become then Liberal Party presidential bet Mar Roxas’s running mate as gratuity for his demolition job on then Vice President Jejomar Binay who also made a bid for the presidency. The situation is different today not only because of the pandemic but also due to the changed political landscape. President Rodrigo Duterte broke the political template with the strategy he employed in 2015. It was political striptease at its best. When he finally decided to run, he seized control of the news cycle with his disruptive style.
So far, there is nothing disruptive about the manner with which Senators Ping Lacson and Tito Sotto are going about their candidacies. Sotto has gone all-in with his political gamble. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) has broken with administration. It was announced last week that it will not be renewing its alliance with Hugpong ng Pagbabago. Sotto won’t be ousted as Senate President this late in the game but the President took a dig at him last Saturday at the inauguration of the new Clark Airport Terminal by referring to him as “Vice-President Vicente Sotto”.
The public has to realize that it’s not easy to come to a decision to challenge any incumbent, specially a hugely popular one. This comes with a lot of risk. But Sotto is throwing it all in because he has reached the apex of his political career. He did the same in 2004 when he cast his lot with then presidential candidate Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ). Ironically, that was the same year Lacson also broke from the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) to run as an independent candidate for president with Carlos Padilla as his running mate. Politics is about timing and few are given second chances. What is different today is the traditional opposition is in its death throes. If left on its own, the administration will run roughshod over the opposition. It wouldn’t be much of a competition but more of a massacre at the polls. This is what he Lacson-Sotto tandem aims to achieve; give the voters an option.
Lacson-Sotto brings a wealth of track-record and experience to the table. Ping has his weakness not in leadership and work ethic but more in his connecting with the public. He does not joke around. His demeanor is stern. He is all business. He keeps his personal life private though it has been exposed in the past then weaponized against him. He has survived an organized vilification campaign which led to his becoming a fugitive. On the other hand, there is Tito Sen with his Tito, Vic and Joey and Eat Bulaga roots. The Dabarkads are a formidable force since they are the base of the longest-running noontime show in the country. This is what got him elected to the Senate four times. His political provenance has roots in Cebu which is one of the most vote-rich provinces in the country. The province with the most number of voters is Cavite where Lacson traces his roots in Imus. Sotto has been registering with voters in the Vice-Presidential race with double-digit ratings which is the same with his job approval as Senate President. Lacson finds himself in the fringes of the margin for error but this is due to public perception. This can still be changed since he has crossed his Rubicon. It falls on him to convince the public why he should be the next President of the Philippines.
The Lacson-Sotto tandem’s advantage is in their ability to appeal to the middle-of-the-road voters who identify neither with the administration nor with the opposition. Recently released Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA) data shows the three most populous regions as the National Capital Region (NCR), Region 3 and Region 4-A. The ten most vote-rich provinces are in the order of number of voters are Cavite, Rizal, Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, Batangas, Cebu, Bataan and La Union. A digital campaign can target specific demographic parameters to a degree not possible in the past.
The Lacson-Sotto tandem has a clearer path to a possible victory than the opposition will ever have in this race. Voters who are tired of the old narrative being peddled by the traditional opposition will see Lacson-Sotto as an opportunity to look at the issues from a fresh perspective. With the possibility of the 2022 race having only three candidates at most, it may well become a referendum on the Duterte administration. Do voters want more of the same or do they want a change? This is why it is essential that this election be issues-based and not personality-based. The future of our country depends on it in these times where the only certainty is uncertainty.",Politics
President Rodrigo Duterte as Vice President in 2022? Only Filipinos hold the RIGHT to decide!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/president-rodrigo-duterte-as-vice-president-in-2022-only-filipinos-hold-the-right-to-decide/,"Early this year, I was one of the first to float the idea of a Duterte-Duterte tandem in the 2022 elections, with Davao City Mayor Sara “Inday Sara” Duterte-Carpio as candidate for president and her father, incumbent President Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte, as candidate for vice president. My reason for doing so is for continuity in the programs, policies and projects that were started by Digong. This can only happen if the next president belongs to his inner circle or his closest political ally, and his daughter, Inday Sara, is the best and most qualified person to assure us that. At the same time, a “Leni Robredo situation,” — one where the vice president is more of an obstructionist and opportunist who causes unnecessary disruptions to government programs, policies and projects, and shamelessly smears on the image of government and the country before a local and foreign audience — should not happen again, thus the idea of having Digong becoming vice president after serving as president for six years.
What was a mere idea of Digong running for vice president months ago is now slowly turning into a real possibility. The recent Pulse Asia survey showed Digong as the most preferred possible for vice president in the 2022 elections. He has a somewhat comfortable lead over the person who ranked second, Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso.
So far, Digong has been sending mixed and often not so serious messages regarding the possibility of him running for vice president. Much earlier, he said that he would not seek the vice presidency if his Inday Sara would run for presidency. Nowadays, he seemed to be trolling everybody by saying that he is considering the idea of running for vice president, with his most recent statement, delivered during the National Assembly of his party, PDP-Laban, at Clark, Pampanga last July 17, 2021 where he suggested that he would run for vice president in 2022 “because of the constitutional immunity from suit that accompanies the position, no thanks to persistent threat of lawsuits to filed against him by the likes of Antonio Trillanes IV and Antonio Carpio.”
The idea of Digong running for vice president has, for some weird reason, shaken the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, which still claims to have a monopoly over national political and intellectual discourse, and the decision-making process over the political and economic destiny of the country. The likes of Christian Monsod and Maria Sol Taule said on both traditional and non-traditional mainstream media outlets that Digong “is not allowed” to run for vice president because, according to them, 1987 Constitution prohibits the president for running for re-election. They see a president running for vice president as a form of “re-election” because the vice president can succeed the president in case of the latter dies or becomes incapacitated. Other members of the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media, having ran out of other valid reasons, were saying that Digong should not run for vice president in 2022 “out of delicadeza” because “he mismanaged the Philippines as president.” Obviously, members of the elite in the capital are already overreacting to something that has not yet happened simply because some people floated the idea of Digong running for vice president and Digong sending mixed, or, should I say, trolling messages flirting with the idea.
But then again, is Digong really qualified to run for vice president in 2022 when his six-year term as president ends?
Section 4, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution states that:
“The President shall not be eligible for any re-electon.”
What does “re-election” mean? Dictionary.com defines “re-election” as:
“The election of a person or persons for a further term of office.”
Is an incumbent president running for vice president when his term of office ends a form of “re-election?” Even a grade school-level child would say no because the positions of president and vice president are not the same. A person who seeks re-election wants a further term of office for the same elected office. This is not possible in the case of the President because Section 4, Article VII of 1987 Constitution explicitly states that the incumbent cannot run for re-election when his single six-year term ends, which makes the assertion of Monsod and Taule partially correct.
However, the 1987 Constitution did not explicitly prohibit the incumbent president from seeking a lower elective post such as that of vice president, senator, congressman, governor, vice governor, provincial board member, mayor, vice mayor, city or municipal councilor, barangay captain and barangay kagawad. There are precedents to this prior to the hullabaloo created by members of the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, and mainstream media when the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022 was floated.
When Joseph “Erap” Estrada was deposed from power as president in 2001, he ran again for president in 2010. He claimed that he could run again for president because “he was not able to finish” his six-year term as president, which was supposed to end in 2004. He ranked second behind eventual winner Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino, III and even performed better than early frontrunner and his erstwhile ally Manny Villar. In 2013, after making a highly publicized decision to switch voter registration and residence from San Juan to Manila, he ran for Mayor of Manila, challenging and eventually winning against then incumbent Mayor Alfredo Lim. Erap served as Mayor of Manila for six years from 2013 to 2019.
At the conclusion of her full six-year term as President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ran for and won the House seat for her home province of Pampanga. PGMA served as Pampanga congresswoman for nine years, most of which she spent under hospital and house arrest due to trumped up charges filed against her by Noynoy’s administration, all of which were eventually dismissed by the courts. On her final three-year term as congresswoman, she was elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives, replacing Davao del Norte Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez and with her leading the chamber in passing key pieces of legislation that were in line with the legislative agenda of the Duterte administration.
When Erap and PGMA decided to seek lower elective posts upon the conclusion of the respective terms of office as President of the Philippines, did we hear anything from the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media? The answer is none. There was nothing but silence from them at both instances.
So why are the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media afraid of the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022? Are they fearful of the possibility of him winning as vice president, as how the recent Pulse Asia survey results would suggest? Are they afraid of the possibility of two Dutertes- Inday Sara as President and Digong as Vice President- holding the top two political positions of the land, as suggested also by the latest Pulse Asia preferred president and vice president candidates surveys?
Clearly, there is no legal impediment for Digong to run for vice president, senator, congressman, governor, vice governor, provincial board member, mayor, vice mayor, city or municipal councilor, barangay captain and barangay kagawad when his term as president ends. As a lawyer and former prosecutor, he knows the provisions stated by the 1987 Constitution, which is why everything is going to be legal should he decide to seek the vice president post next year. If he decides to run and eventually wins as vice president during the 2022 elections and, one way or another, becomes president on the basis of line of succession, as stated on Section 8, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, that should not be taken against him. Responsibility for that loophole falls upon Corazon “Cory” Aquino’s handpicked framers of the 1987 Constitution, including the ever-so-noisy Christian Monsod. They evidently lacked foresight and applied a reactionary nature to drafting it being driven by a paranoid-schizophrenic fear of a repeat of the events that happened during the time of President Ferdinand Marcos.
I should say let Digong run for vice president in 2022 if he really wants to run during next year’s election. At the end of the day, it will be the Filipino people who would decide if they want him to become vice president after serving as president for six years. The only ones who make a fuss out of the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022 are those who are aware of the fact that the majority of Filipinos does not like them anymore and, just like in 2016 and 2019, they are going to end up being flushed down the drain once again.",Politics
Sotto-Lacson tandem emerges as the new GENUINE Opposition as Inday Sara #Daughterte tops 2022 stardom,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/sotto-lacson-tandem-emerges-as-the-new-genuine-opposition-as-inday-sara-daughterte-tops-2022-stardom/,"The recent Pulse Asia survey has the Presidential daughter and Davao City Mayor Inday Sara “Daughterte” at the top of the rankings followed by Manila Mayor Isko Moreno but not a close second. Still, the question: Will she run? From a definitive no it has now become a conditional yes. She has met with the leaders of the power blocs supporting the President’s administration. The Marcoses and former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) have broken bread with her. Only the Villar Nacionalistas have not done the same though they have indicated they will renew their alliance with her Hugpong ng Pagbabago.
The Presidential troll has not spared his daughter having said glibly that he is inclined to run for Vice-President. He later on admitted that this was only to keep his detractors at bay. President Rodrigo Duterte was apparently piqued by Senate President Tito Sotto’s show of support for the corruption exposé of Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao. Yesterday, Sotto was again the object of the President’s joke. He referred to Sotto as “Vice-President” when he acknowledged his presence at the inauguration of the new terminal at Clark International Airport. This comes with the act of breaking away from the ruling coalition which Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) spokesperson Goyo Larrazabal announced last Friday. Inday Sara succeeding her father became plausible when she cobbled a coalition that ousted then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez in 2018. The move was stealthily executed that even the President was caught unaware and had to wait for the situation to resolve itself before he could deliver his State of the Nation Address (SONA). It was also he who revealed later that it was a Sara rather than a GMA show.
Daughterte inherited her father’s political acumen. She tested the waters as campaign manager of Hugpong in the 2019 midterm election. This had her going around the country getting the feel of the campaign. She is also a silent operator who builds alliances on her own. She is unlike other Presidential progenies who rely on their father to guide their political career. The reality is the Davao political base of the Dutertes is split. The Origs are looking at Senator Bong Go to succeed his boss. Inday Sara having a mind of her own is apparently not too keen on this idea. I never imagined Bong Go would become a Senator. I thought he would become the most powerful man in the country as the gatekeeper. Go’s rise is largely from trust and confidence the President has in him. But would this trump blood? Duterte has been dissuading Daughterte from running. Whether this is true or not is anyone’s guess as no one is privy to the family dynamics. The Origs will be out of power when Daughterte does ascend to power as she will very likely put together her own team.
There is the issue of Inday Sara’s experience as well. She hasn’t really practiced her profession after passing the bar as she plunged into politics immediately being the eldest in the family. Definitely she has the advantage because she will have the counsel of her father if and when she wins. Will she be the one to continue her father’s agenda or will she steer the country down her own path? The public has gravitated to the Duterte style of leadership. This is proven by Inday Sara being on top of the surveys. The people want continuity. Daughterte can tap the next generation of leaders to be at her side for guidance and also have her father’s team on the sidelines for wisdom.
It does not look like Isko will have a chance in a mano-a-mano with her. Isko is not a lawyer nor does he have the experience that Daugherte has. The better challenger would be the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem which has the track record of experience and the machinery at the national and local levels to boot. If it comes to down to this, the 2022 Presidential race could boil down to a choice between which flavor of governance the people prefer. Would it be Lacson-Sotto with Ping’s more Presidential and statesmanlike demeanor or would it be a continuation of the Duterte brand of leadership under the progeny?
It will be an interesting race because neither personality is prone to mudslinging. Lacson has been pushing for issues-based rather than personality-based politics. Daughterte only resorts to insults when insulted first. Witness how she rebuked the statement made by the incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo about Davao City’s pandemic response. Robredo didn’t even bother to reply anymore. Isko took a potshot at Daughterte after his State of the City address. This was ignored by the Presidential daughter. She probably thinks that Isko is nothing more than a creation of social media.
The Manila Mayor has been slipping of late. His State of the City address was more pandering than a reflection of his continuing vision for the capital city. Opening up the city’s public schools for non-residents is one. He is selling more dreams than reality which does not bode well for a Presidential run because it only exposes his inexperience. His window of opportunity is also closing because there are no more political parties which he can use as his flag of convenience. The Isko for President Movement hasn’t taken off despite Tim Orbos being its lead convenor. It does not make sense for him to run for higher office given the present circumstances he finds himself in.
For the most part it would appear that the Presidential contest would be a three-way race at most if Robredo pushes through with her candidacy.

Self-crowned “Chief Political Analyst” Antonio Contreras continues to use the Manila Times to promote his lame “voter base” analysis,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/self-crowned-chief-political-analyst-antonio-contreras-continues-to-use-the-manila-times-to-promote-his-lame-voter-base-analysis/,"Surveys as determinants of the shape of one’s voter base aren’t accurate. Why? Think of it for a minute. What if the candidate does not really have a voter base to begin with? As stated in a previous piece, Isko’s voter base is Manila. Grant him the benefit of the doubt and give him the National Capital Region (NCR) for argument’s sake. Though it is one of the most populous regions in the country, it does not mean each and every voter will go for Isko. The same is true with Manny Pacquiao and Grace Poe. The same was true for Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. But in the end, it’s the electricity in the air which an individual with excellent political gut feel will sense that a candidate will win. This was true with Duterte in 2016.
What then is “chief political analyst” Antonio Contreras touting as the middle ground with Pacquiao, Isko and Poe? In his Manila Times piece “Is a Moreno-Pacquiao (or Pacquiao-Moreno) middle ground rising?”, Contreras insists that President Rodrigo Duterte “may not even have the much-touted political firewall that comes with what used to be projected by his loyal DDS [“Die-hard Duterte Supporters”] as his formidable political base.” Contreras goes on to sneer that “he may not even have the assured protection from his daughter [Davao Mayor Inday Sara Duterte] if she runs for president, as her prevailing numbers indicate she is far from being a done deal despite being a frontrunner.” He goes on…
Her 28-percent preference rating for a presidential run stands in the context of an upper limit of a voter base of people willing to vote for her in any position that is only 37.6 percent. And this pales in comparison to the 53.8 percent voter base of Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso. In fact, Pasig City Mayor Victor “Vico” Sotto, while unqualified to run for president, has a broader voter base at 41.5 percent.
I’ve always opined that an Isko – Grace Poe tandem is viable. But as a winner, that’s another thing altogether. Their combined glass ceiling is low. The same is true with an Isko – Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao pairing. That’s an even lower glass ceiling there unless Filipinos prefer entertainment over governance for the next six years.
This is where Contreras fails as a “Chief Political Analyst”. He lacks the experience of being a key player in a campaign for national office. Candidates may win in several different ways. Some will pay to win. Look at Win Gatchalian in 2016. Some will make ex-deals for votes. Look at Joel Villanueva in 2016. But most candidates have a voter base by virtue of their provenance. Franklin Drilon is an Ilonggo. Leila De Lima is a Bicolana. And so on and so forth. For a time, there was a Catholic vote. These sorts of thinking do not hold now in the present context. The Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) vote is still there which is why it has become a ritual among national candidates to win the backing of the INC. Pacman has a voter base in Vis-Min but it does not mean that they will all vote for him. He’s popular as a boxer first. As a politician is another set of criteria in the public mindset.
At this point, the centrist position has been claimed by the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem with their confirmation they are running. A prospective Senate slate has been announced. Contreras is still devoid of political pragmatism because he still can’t see that political parties have been reduced to flags of convenience. Duterte will definitely endorse some of the “NPC” (Nationalist People’s Coalition) candidates. They were also on the list floated the other day. After the election is over, there will be coalition-building again which is a euphemism for switching loyalties in order to get funds for projects and getting pet bills passed.
Contreras seems oblivious to what happened to the candidate he endorsed in 2016. Jejomar Binay lost. His bête noire now is Duterte because of his bitterness. Emotions cloud the judgment of a “political analyst”. One should be both pragmatic and objective if one’s credibility as such is to be established. I wonder how many clients have so far engaged Contreras’s firm so far. They would be throwing good money after bad having him on their team as their principal political adviser. He hasn’t even had the experience of travelling throughout the country specially to the remote regions of the archipelago for him to have a feel of voter sentiment in those places.

Lacson-Sotto genuine Opposition the final nail in the coffin of the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/lacson-sotto-genuine-opposition-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-the-yellowtards/,"Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) makes much of the old political party conventions to select national candidates. In his piece today “Candidates looking for a reason” he writes about “what the absence of political party conventions tells about the state of our politics not just today, but for the past 40 years.”
We’re familiar with party conventions because of the United States, and our pre-martial law conventions were patterned on those our political leaders attended in the United States because Filipinos would lobby at each party convention for an independence plank to be included in the party platform (we had success with the Democrats but not the Republicans). But even in America, the conventions have become largely ceremonial occasions since 1968, because instead of delegates battling it out, their votes are predetermined through the system of primaries, where candidates compete to win pledged delegates.
Here at home, before the primary system could be copied, martial law killed the old parties. But it is worth reviewing what set our conventions apart from the Americans.
Truth is these were just for show as it was essentially imposed upon by the Americans during the Commonwealth period. But that was also a period of monolithic rule as the party in power was controlled by his adoptive grandfather El Mestizo, Manuel Quezon. It was General Douglas MacArthur who ordered Manuel Roxas to put up the Liberal Party. Collaboration with the Japanese was the major issue then and post-independence politics dictated that the veritable pound of flesh be extracted. Not that Roxas was clean himself. It was just that he was fortunate enough to obtain MacArthur’s anointment. Roxas went on to defeat Sergio Osmeña in the 1946 election. The Americans then had their puppet government in place.
The 1935 Constitution was even hastily-amended to give the Americans parity rights for them to be able to control their business interests in the country. The convention system eventually died and what has been taking place post the regime of former President Ferdinand Marcos is effectively a crowning but without the guarantee of victory. It was only Cory Aquino’s anointed son Noynoy Aquino who won under a cloud of electoral fraud by the thinnest of pluralities. Rodrigo Duterte broke that mold in 2016 by running on his own terms. Proof of this is the announcement last night of the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto camp that they are running for President and Vice-President respectively.
If Danding Cojuangco were still alive this would never happen without his explicit approval. But with the passing of the Boss last year and the inability or lack of interest of Ramon Ang to continue the role of Danding, it was inevitable that Tito Sotto would take the reigns of the party as its most senior member. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) is the oldest and longest-surviving post-Marcos political party in the country which still has a loyal membership. Political parties have evolved to becoming representative not only of political but economic interest as well. Ramon Ang’s pockets aren’t as deep as Danding’s which is another reason why he didn’t claim the titular leadership of the NPC.
The National Unity Party of Ricky Razon is better financed and they have announced they will stick with the administration. Lacson-Sotto is in the best position to challenge the administration to provide the public with a viable alternative in the 2022 polls. Vice President Leni Robredo and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno are still wet-behind-the-ears politicians who don’t really possess a track record of experience, most of all gravitas, to lead the country. In Lacson-Sotto, the public has two battle-seasoned veterans of the legislative and executive branches who understand how the system works and what it will take to get things done. It is also a welcome development because Lacson focuses more on policy debates than popularity. He disdains appealing to the baser instincts of the masses unlike other candidates who sing and dance their way to electoral victory without knowing what to do after they’ve won.
Now the public awaits their platform of government which they are sure to present when they make their formal announcement on August 4. What we are witnessing here is the birth of a new opposition and the death of the old one which simply couldn’t get anything right after they lost in 2016 and 2019. This development also puts the final nail in the coffin of the convenor group that MLQ3 is fond of. Lacson was wise to reject the overture of 1Sambayan. He pointed out in his letter to its founder, Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, the disconnect given he (Lacson) was a principal author of the Anti-Terror Bill in the Senate and also supported the passage of the law enacting the National Identification System which are complementary.
If the 2022 election becomes a two-party race then it will be to the public’s benefit. The 2022 election is crucial to our survival because of the pandemic environment. There has to be disruption in government in order to address the disruption caused by the pandemic in our government and society.",Politics
In these times of pandemic Filipinos need a UNIFYING Opposition rather than a divisive one,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/in-these-times-of-pandemic-filipinos-need-a-unifying-opposition-rather-than-a-divisive-one/,"The Delta variant just dashed the hope that a global economic recovery would begin two years into the pandemic. While most of the opinions expressed have been about pandemic response, both good and bad, the no one has dared to point out the elephant in the room that is the only clear path to putting an end to the pandemic; increased vaccine supplies. Viruses mutate continuously while circulating. That is  a fact. Yet rich countries continue to prioritize their own population for vaccination. This year we have seen how COVID-19 has ravaged South America, Brazil and Peru, in particular in that region. India has suffered worse than Brazil with record cases and deaths.
The same is being replicated now in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Indonesia, which is passing India’s numbers. Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar, are all enforcing lockdowns in a bid to contain the spread of Delta. But this is hard to do considering this variant is 1,260 times more contagious and has a shorted incubation period. The first community transmission was confirmed in the country on Thursday evening. Just as everyone thought it was safe to reopen, it is not again.
Filipinos have been grappling with uncertainty since the Luzon lockdown took effect. That prevented a heavy first wave but complacency caught up in March when cases spiked fueled by the UK variant. Healthcare capacity was strained but not to the point that people were dying on the streets. It was nowhere near the catastrophe that befell India and, now, Indonesia. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) still does not have a uniform contact-tracing system in place. There is no adherence to the 3Ts; test trace and treat. By the time the surge was contained in NCR+, another spike began in the regions. New cases haven’t fallen below 3,000 on a daily basis since March.
While the government has passed key legislation charting the path to economic recovery, the mindset is still that COVID-19 can be beaten. Unfortunately, this will not happen while majority of the global population remains unvaccinated. The virus will continue to mutate. Rich countries cornered vaccine supplies last year after the pharmaceutical companies announced a breakthrough in vaccine development. The equitable distribution of vaccines under the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) Covax facility largely went for naught because supply was short. The rich countries stockpiled vaccines good for three times their populations. It was inevitable that we would come to this point again.
Singapore has been more pragmatic in its approach. Their mindset is now Covid is endemic. The government is taking measures for its citizens and the economy to transition to the new normal. The Philippines should do the same. Our work is cut out for us because the government has no digitization plan in place. Connectivity is an issue even in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). What more in the regions?
For economic recovery to begin, there is the need for disruptive reforms in both the public and private sector. The Luzon lockdown put in focus the underdevelopment of the regions. This makes the 2022 election crucial because clear platforms of action need to be presented by candidates running for office. The economy, education and public health are the main issues the public deems as having the highest impact in their daily lives since the pandemic began.
The Opposition is constantly haranguing the government for social amelioration and stimulus when it is hard-pressed to increase revenue collection in the midst of the recession caused by the pandemic. Infrastructure development is better because it generates employment and economic activities. The so-called economic experts just want to agitate the poor so they can win them over their side in time for the election.
The Delta variant is a serious threat not only to the economy but also the citizenry. It falls upon us to take the necessary precautions. We should be united as a nation in facing the challenges posed by the pandemic and finding solutions. Divisiveness will not get us anywhere. The President has been appealing for unity since he won in 2016. This has fallen on the deaf ears of the Opposition. Think about it. Why would they still hold protest rallies on Monday when the President delivers his final State of the Nation Address (SONA) given the health risks?
The public should realize that divisions only serve to worsen the situation. Instead of criticisms, it’s best if out-of-the-box solutions are proposed instead. This is the only way to move forward and minimize the element of uncertainty that each and every Filipino is dealing with at present.",Politics
The time is right: 2022 could potentially see a Marcos back in Malacanang,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-time-is-right-2022-could-potentially-see-a-marcos-back-in-malacanang/,"Mang Ding still has his political crystal ball from his days at the Daily Express. In his PhilSTAR piece today “Marcos-Duterte duo looms large in 2022”, veteran journalist Federico Pascual writes of his profound fear that “a strategic link-up of the Marcos and the Duterte dynasties would be so overwhelming that only divine intervention could prevent its sweeping the 2022 national positions down to the senatorial level.” He then issues his desperate call to anyone — anyone — who could be bothered to heed it…
What/Who will organize and revitalize disparate opposition elements to move quickly as one with the people to stop what looks like an impending viral sweep by a Marcos-Duterte alliance?
Hold that thought for a minute while I digress a bit.
I had been tipped off about former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez’s departure from PDP-Laban as a result of the appointment of Manny Pacquiao as Acting President. This didn’t sit well with the former Speaker because it didn’t go through the process. Alvarez has keen political acumen. Proof is how he took down Tonyboy Floirendo and made mincemeat of Inday Sara’s candidates in his bailiwick in 2019. They all lost. Alvarez was looking at an independent Presidential run at that time. He can beat at Duterte machinery in his bailiwick but no way cannot be done at the national level.
Manila Mayor Isko Moreno was being backed by anti-Duterte oligarchs from Day One of his mayorship. He was being touted as a kinder and gentler Duterte. The problem was the shoe wouldn’t fit because of his limited intellectual capacity. Isko may be popular but he doesn’t have gravitas.
It’s not worth discussing the candidacy of Vice President Leni Robredo because only her die-hards believe she is capable. We all know what happened in 2016. Then vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos (BBM) wanted to run for President in 2016 but was advised against doing so by what remains of his late dad Apo Lakay’s closest advisers. They felt the time still wasn’t right and BBM had no viable running mate.
Okay then.
This time around the time would be right and there is a running mate who can potentially carry a Marcos to victory. This is still not set in stone. Why? A Marcos Presidency is still a notion that may be hard for Filipinos to digest. Furthermore, it could get the oligarchs to open their checkbooks and spend to prevent it from materializing. The truth of the matter is the sequestered companies sold by Marcos cronies with the blessing of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) are owned by the Marcoses and they have the documents to prove it. PLDT and Philcomsat alone are worth billions and the Marcoses did not profit from their sale.
As it stands now, the viable options are Marcos-Duterte (i.e. Rodrigo Duterte, PRRD) or Duterte (as in Inday Sara Duterte, ISD) – Marcos. It can also be a Duterte (ISD) – Romualdez (House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez) ticket with BBM running for the Senate to eventually become Senate President. The efforts of closet oppositionists such as Koko Pimentel, to split the administration vote by running Manny Pacquiao, is doomed to fail. Filipinos aren’t stupid to vote for Pac-Man as President no matter what he promises. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) is now in the best position to become the new Opposition in the event they lose in 2022. But they also have the best path to a potential victory for Filipinos looking for an alternative between the opposition and the administration.
The political dynamic is greatly affected by the pandemic. It does not help that there is the looming surge due to the Delta variant. In effect, the pandemic is the great equalizer. The US election has proven this although now there seems to be growing buyer’s remorse with Biden. What is certain at this point, is the death of the Yellow Ribbon and the Hammer and Sickle in 2022. This will be for the good of all Filipinos moving forward.",Politics
Long-overdue campaign financing laws and system change needed to make democracy work FOR Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/long-overdue-campaign-financing-laws-and-system-change-needed-to-make-democracy-work-for-filipinos/,"Former Ambassador and Manila Times columnist writes in his piece “For the funds of it” today about “one of the main reasons – other than megalomania – why so many seem to want to run for Philippine electoral posts, even for national posts.” For the most part, Tiglao points out, “It’s an income-generating project.” The inference to the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is there for everyone to read.
The phrase describes the strange phenomenon in Philippine elections in which candidates, except for the very rich, end up richer after an election, whether they win or lose.
The practice has been institutionalized for the longest time. It may have been prevalent in past Presidential contests where there was a high element of political instability but this time around, with an Opposition in its death throes, what would the public’s alternative be if there was no Lacson-Sotto to put up a challenge against the administration? It’s no secret that politics is a lucrative “profession” in the country. This is specially true at the local level among Governors, Mayors and Congressmen. Political contributions are invested in legitimate businesses which provides employment and tax revenues for the government. Ask any elected official and this is their usual defense against allegations of corruption.
Running for the two highest posts in the land is not easy during normal times. It is more difficult now in the middle of the pandemic. The incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo refuses to admit the fact that she has no financial backing for a Presidential campaign because of her image problem even if her survey numbers are higher than Lacson’s. This is the essence of democracy; the freedom to choose in a manner where the people make their choices known through the ballot. In comparison, a federal parliamentary system is less expensive for the candidate and the public. Why? A Prime Minister can be voted out of office for loss of confidence. Continuity can also be ensured and lawmaking an easier process because Cabinet Ministers are also members of parliament. The 1987 Constitution is but the justification for the continuing existence of oligarchs and corruption in government, if you think about it. How much do taxpayers spend annually for the Senate and the House of Representatives? A system consisting of regional parliaments and a single national parliament is cheaper, more effective, and allows the direct participation of constituents.
It is crucial for the public to have a choice in the 2022 election. The people are wary of the Opposition’s intransigent attitude towards the administration. There are those in the Opposition who would vote for a viable alternative. There are also those who are disaffected with the administration. This can’t be denied. Each individual has an opinion. This is the basic principle of a democracy no matter how flawed. But there is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully once the Lacson-Sotto tandem makes public their platform, federalism and charter change find their place in it. Lacson’s Budget Reform for Village Empowerment Bill (BRAVE) actually makes development funds available for the provinces down to the barangay level that are not subject to the control of the national government. This prevents the politicization of the release of funds from the national budget which is traditionally under the control of the Executive and the Congressmen by way of the Internal Revenue Allotment and the pork barrel. It is a budget reform measure aimed at minimizing corruption and ensuring funds are spent for the benefit of the constituents.
The more stringent reform measure to prevent politicians from running “for the funds of it” as the former Ambassador puts it, is the enactment of a campaign finance law which would allow the public to contribute to candidates campaigns directly. Current campaign finance provisions in the Omnibus Election Code are a joke. Every Juan knows that campaign spending reports are doctored to comply with the law. Delay in submission means disqualification but look at what happened in 2016 when then Comelec Chair Andy Bautista granted the Liberal Party an “extension” to prevent disqualification. This is not provided for under the Omnibus Election Code and then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez filed suit against the Comelec but nothing came out of it anymore. Maybe we are really better off under an authoritarian government but while we are in a democracy, there is no other choice but to be politically pragmatic.",Politics
Reform of the Ph’s corrupt bureaucracy only possible if 1987 Charter is JUNKED,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/reform-of-the-phs-corrupt-bureaucracy-only-possible-if-1987-charter-is-junked/,"In his Inquirer piece “Behind the durability of institutions”, Randy David speaks of public institutions which withstand the revolving door of leaders who come and go every Presidential election cycle. These are the constitutional offices with a fixed term, regardless of whoever is in power or the highest career bureaucrat in any department or agency of government. Governments are similar to private corporations in this respect. When a new CEO takes over, he usually brings with him his own team. There is the accompanying politics and power plays within the organization. It’s part of how the game is played.
Other countries have stronger institutions simply because of control mechanisms designed to isolate the administrator from politics. The other side of the coin is when the administrator uses the institution to work against the the government. Examples would be the Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the Vice-President. These institutions do the public a disservice because they perform their mandate in a manner which is detrimental to government. Witness how they have worked against not only the Chief Executive but also the public they are supposed to serve. The civil service code was supposed to be the guide for bureaucrats.
In earlier times, only the best and brightest joined government. Low ranking positions were handed out as political largesse. The higher positions were reserved for those who were at least qualified. The same standards were held for those running for elective office. But the truth is, the dynamics would vary between the national and the local level. Patronage politics, influence-peddling and power brokers are all part of politics anywhere in the world. It is the level which varies.
Nonetheless, David criticizes President Rodrigo Duterte again in this piece.
In the remaining one year of the Duterte presidency, we will be witnessing the quiet departure from public office of some of those who had joined this administration and shamelessly allowed themselves to be used to buttress the powers and burnish the image of an unworthy leader. Some of them may be appointed ambassadors or justices, or rewarded with sinecures in government corporations. Others may simply retire from public life.
The truth is, the bureaucracy is defective. Local chief executives get a pass when they don’t perform because critics would prefer to lay the blame at the feet of the President because it is convenient. The media play and mileage is better. Social media has made it possible to immediately measure public sentiment on issues raised. The Opposition tends to confuse viral posts with election victory. There is no causal relationship to begin with. It is not guaranteed. It thus raises the question, why does the system work better in other countries?
It’s really simple. Government offices at the national level can be manned by anyone who is qualified but regional and local offices should be manned by those who are actually from the constituencies. The pandemic has exposed the development imbalance between Luzon against Visayas and Mindanao. If there was balanced development then the economic recession wouldn’t have been as severe as it has been. This imbalance should be corrected moving forward if the mindset will finally be that the pandemic is endemic. It won’t happen with one fingers’ snap but steps should be taken to make it a reality.
It is actually painful to see that challengers to the administration continue to use old obsolete tactics applied to winning votes. The incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo has been at it for five years even if her efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The other candidates are making the same mistake. What these politicians miss out on is the fact that public opinion is now very dynamic because of the easy access to information. In 2019, the Opposition candidates lost. They didn’t change their strategy. This didn’t improve their prospects for 2022. You don’t solve a problem by throwing money at it.
The structure is also important and the same goes for the institutions created by the structure. The Budget Reform for Village Empowerment (BRAVE) Bill authored by Sen. Panfilo Lacson allocates development funds for provinces, cities/municipalities and barangays. It basically bypasses the control of the Congressmen and the Executive Branch in the disbursement of funds to the local level. It has a noble purpose but the challenge lies in getting it passed into law. The oversight function is also very bureaucratic because it is at the national level. Regional development has a better chance of success if the review and decision-making process is at the same level.
This is why the reform of the political structure should be an election issue. The 16 million voters of President Duterte in 2016 pinned some of their hopes on the promise of federalism. Nene Pimentel had the same in mind when the Local Government Code was drafted. We have seen how the law is still largely ineffective. The BRAVE Bill of Sen. Lacson is also a step in the right direction but it still falls short of what is actually needed to achieve the goal.
Leave it to Opposition stalwarts like Randy David to see the problem but not propose any solution. This is because they don’t want to touch their precious 1987 Constitution even if it is obvious that it has been the root of our political and social problems since it was passed. It’s about time that this is acknowledged and addressed.",Politics
"Old motherhood statements no longer work in political narratives, time for REAL platforms and vision!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/old-motherhood-statements-no-longer-work-in-political-narratives-time-for-real-platforms-and-vision/,"In his Manila Standard piece “The narrative”, columnist Lito Banayo focuses on the candidate’s narrative as the selling point. He highlights what, at first, seems to be a disturbing fact in Philippine politics…
It will not be the facts enumerated today; nor even the truths we will either believe or dispute.  It will be the narrative of the candidate, his or her life story, and how he or she can build upon it to better people’s lives—that is what will the voter give the candidate a “yes!” come Election Day 2022.
This has worked well in past elections but it may not be as potent as it was for the 2022 election cycle. The dynamics of voters have changed with their exposure to social media. Witness how Rappler was born in 2012 as a result of the need to “manage” the impeachment trial of then Supreme Court Chief Justice, the late Renato Corona. Optics was vital but the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino wasn’t confident that it would succeed in its goal of putting public pressure on the Senators. This was why the so-called “Disbursement Acceleration Program” (DAP) — essentially pork barrel thinly-disguised by a nonsensical acronym — was the last resort to get the Senators to convict.
In the Corona camp was formed the first of the so-called “bloggers,” the social media influencers who could sway public opinion with their posts. Jojo Robles was its father. This is what I encountered when I decided to go back to writing in 2013. If I found an interesting article, I would post it on my Facebook account with my own short take on the content. It was inevitable that I wrote about politics because, I have to admit, I’m a political junkie. The Opposition to the Aquino administration was born on social media. Traditional political operatives didn’t see the trend because most of them were Luddites. Since then, the social media political landscape has expanded by leaps and bounds. It was Nic Gabunada who saw the trend and made it work for then candidate, Rodrigo Duterte, specially for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). Other candidates’ operatives didn’t have a clue how social media worked. Their basic construct was to post news stories from envelopmental journalists on Facebook.
Facebook has evolved since then. It is now hard to develop an organic following unlike before because Facebook now wants you to pay for the following. Back in the day, it was likes and shares which got you noticed. This pattern was confirmed by the latest Pahayag survey of Publicus. Manila Mayor Isko Moreno’s and Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao’s popularity numbers are down. The President’s trust and approval numbers are down as well. But this is to be expected as the pandemic is foremost in the minds of Filipinos. Their hopes were dashed by the surge in March through April and there is now the Delta variant to contend with.
President Rodrigo Duterte’s last State of the Nation Address (SONA) wasn’t dramatic in its focus on the pandemic. Naysayers will always be negative. But the truth is, the measures passed pre-pandemic had an impact on softening the blow on the citizenry. If there was no free tertiary education and universal healthcare, where would Filipinos be now? The President made mention of e-governance in his tasking to Congress. This is digitization. It is really up to Congress because the budget season begins in August. If there is to be any implementation of a law that is to be passed, the budget will be needed as well. The President’s SONA was about what had been achieved. He will do what he can in the time he has left but the visioning for 2022 and beyond will have to come from those who are running in 2022.
It’s now up to the candidates to present their vision and how they intend to achieve that vision. Enlightened voters will not fall for motherhood statements anymore. Recall during the 2016 campaign how Duterte had the same messaging for each and every sortie and rally. The only difference was in the stories he told each crowd. Tipong nag-kukuwentuhan lang na mga kapitbahay sa kantong tindahan. This is what appeals to voters and this is why narratives won’t sell like they used to. Negative campaigning is also out. It does not take a genius to figure out that the more you hit Duterte the more his base rallies around him. In case most of you forgot, particularly the Opposition, he’s still the President. You think he won’t campaign for the administration ticket for 2022? Potential candidates who will still not move today are out.
The next goal post is October which is the deadline for filing of Certificates of Candidacy. Any serious candidate should have a campaign organization in place by that time. The way it looks, the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem has the edge. It has laid claim to the centrist label by declaring first. Lacson could’ve easily won re-election to the Senate and even become Senate President but he has decided to go all-in for a Presidential run. Looks like Banayo won’t have Isko as a candidate anymore. Pac-Man should run for re-election under the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) and away from the clutches of Koko Pimentel and Ron Munsayac. Vice President Leni Robredo is finished. It’s back to the province for her. She should take pity on her “supporters” and stop leading them on by making her decision known. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes is the biggest loser of them all. Isn’t it ironic that the three Senators then who did the demolition job on former Vice President Jejomar Binay are all out? Pimentel, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Trillanes.

In my opinion, the windows of opportunity for Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and Senator Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao have been shut. This is per the latest Pahayag survey conducted by Publicus Asia.
Former House Speaker Bebot Alvarez displayed his political prowess in 2019 by winning over the Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP) candidates in his bailiwick but we all know that Davao City Mayor Inday Sara “Daugherte” doesn’t take any slight, perceived or otherwise, sitting down. 2022 is a grudge match between the two. If she does run, you can be sure she will focus on the areas where her candidates lost in their Mindanao bailiwicks. The Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) –Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma alliance will only get stronger with the inclusion of the Liberal Party, formally or informally. The targets are the Opposition bailiwicks of Region 5 and 6. The Solid North may not be that solid with Manong Chavit joining the NPC. The vote-rich regions, however, are the National Capital Region (NCR), Region 3 and Region 4-A.
To my mind, a one-on-one showdown between the administration and Lacson-Sotto works to the latter’s advantage. But the final battle will be fought on the ground as election day nears. The regional and provincial parties all cut a deal with then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte when it was clear he was leading back in 2016. Then Vice President Jejomar Binay lost the support of the Remullas. The Revilla and Tolentino clans were the first to cast their lot with Duterte then.
The battle in Negros Occidental will be interesting because Albie Benitez is running against Bing Leonardia for Bacolod City Mayor. Cebu is another battle ground because Sotto traces his roots there while Lacson was Metrodiscom commander when he was still with the Philippine Constabulary. Lacson is a native Caviteño and was also Provincial Commander of Laguna and Isabela. His survey numbers are lower than Vice President Leni Robredo but this works to his advantage because they have nowhere to go but up. He has consistently been in the top 5 or 10 of the Senate races he’s run in.
Lacson and Sotto also have the added advantage of experience and track record in government service which other candidates don’t have. They will hit the ground running if they are victorious on May 2022. My money is still on a two-way race for 2022 for the two top posts.",Politics
Antonio Trillanes: History catches up with a rabid Yellowtard attack dog,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/antonio-trillanes-history-catches-up-with-a-rabid-yellowtard-attack-dog/,"The runup to the May 2022 elections has begun with political realignments taking place at a slower pace compared to the last cycle. This can be attributed to the preoccupation with coping with the pandemic and the fact that there is a vacuum in the political landscape due to a dearth of qualified candidates.
It doesn’t augur well for a country when the first to declare their candidacies is a pair of septuagenarians. This is not disparaging their competence and qualification but more about the question of their capability to come up with an equally disruptive platform of goverment to cope with the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic. Technology provides the solutions to the challenges so it’s hard to think of how they can come up with innovative and out-of-the-box solutions when they’re barely tech-literate?
The incestuous nature of political dynasties also comes into play. Both houses of Congress are bereft of talent who have the potential to work their way up the leadership ladder with an eye on winning the top spot in future Presidential contests.
The Senate is the best or the worst example, depending on how you you look at; Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid are the most senior Senators. Neither one is even hardly qualified, much less capable, of being Majority Leader or Senate President. They’re more silent than outspoken which qualifies them to be the sign language interpreter on televised public hearings if ony they could sign.
The opposition is in the same boat. Much as they wanted to build a coalition against the administration, they failed miserably. 1Sambayan was supposed to be the vehicle to unite leftist-liberal-militants under one roof but this didn’t happen. Their event last June 12 was a miserable failure and with the politicians whom they named have all declined save for Leni Robredo and Antonio Trillanes.
The problem is both have poor chances of winning the two highest posts in the land. Leni Robredo hasn’t been able to gain ground despite being in office for five years as Vice-President. Trillanes is the same because he’s perceived to be a mercenary. Proof of this is how he has taken Robredo to task for her consultations with Sen. Ping Lacson and Sen. Dick Gordon. The outspoken putschist-turned-Senator has publicly rebuked the incumbent Vice-President and titular head of the opposition. This betrays his underlying desire to be the anointed candidate of the opposition despite his being at the bottom rung of the surveys for both Vice-President and Senator.
Trillanes has no one to blame but himself. Despite his unexpected win as Senator in the 2007 midterm election while under detention for leading the Oakwood Mutiny in 2003 against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo he remained resolved. The masa who were disenfranchised by Erap’s ouster vented their ire on Arroyo by making Trillanes win in the Senate race. He became the youngest Senator elected to the office taking over the distinction previously held by Ninoy Aquino.
Trillanes made all the right moves from that time on until 2007 when he and co-accused Gen. Danilo Lim walked out of their trial at a Makati Regional Trial Court and proceeded to the Manila Peninsula hotel to mount another attempt to oust Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The standoff ended badly as Arroyo ordered the PNP Special Action Force to assault the Peninsula where Trillanes, Lim and soldiers and civilians loyal to them were holed up. The image of Trillanes being led out of the Peninsula by his waist band by Superintendent Geary Barias of the PNP is the first image which comes up whenever Trillanes is googled on the internet.
Trillanes would only regain his freedom after Arroyo stepped down in 2010 and Benigno Aquino III assumed the Presidency. He was later granted amnesty for the coup charges leveled against him and promptly began going after his enemies in and outside of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Several anomalies in the AFP were brought before the Senate Blue Ribbon Comittee. All of these were part of the issues which the Magdalo Group claimed pushed them to mount a coup against the Arroyo goverment. It was an ugly specter to see Trillanes relentlessly questioning his seniors at the Academy and the AFP. It resulted in the suicide of Gen.Angelo Reyes and charges being brought against Gen. Carlos Garcia and Jacinto Ligot, who were both AFP Comptrollers.
Trillanes developed a reputation as an attack dog of Aquino. After the AFP scandal came the impeachment of Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012. Aquino had his way with the House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker Sonny Belmonte. The Senate was a more independent body under then Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile but he had to contend with the cabal of pro-Aquino Senators in the persons of Trillanes, Alan Cayetano, Koko Pimentel and TG Guingona.
After Corona’s ignominious conviction under very dubious circumstances came the demolition job on then Vice-President Jejomar Binay. The Senate inquiry on Binay ran for three years until before the 2016 election. It was a demonstration of naked power which was unprecedented as the Senate became the venue of how due process was not accorded the accused in hearings which were supposedly in aid of legislation but appeared to be more in aid of political persecution.
Binay went on to lose in the 2016 Presidential race. The demolition job on him, the subsequent arrest and charging of incumbent Senators Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla and Juan Ponce Enrile by then Justice Secretary Leila De Lima, were all meant to weaken the opposition in preparation for Mar Roxas’ presidential run in 2016.
After Binay, Trillanes focused on Rodrigo Duterte next. He hounded the presidential candidate for all of the campaign period as he originated the hidden wealth claim against the Davao City Mayor with the monies allegedly deposited at the Bank of the Philippine Islands Julia Vargas branch in the Ortigas CBD. He then produced a negative political advertisement showing children cursing as the effect of Duterte’s penchant for lacing his campaign speeches with expletives during the campaign.
Trillanes didn’t stop even after Duterte became President. He has taken it upon himself to unseat Duterte despite his mounting string of failures the latest of which was the series of the Ang Tunay na Narco-list videos on YouTube before the 2019 midterm election. It was also Trillanes who pushed lawyer Jude Sabio into filing a complaint against the President at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands.
What is ironic now is Trillanes is beginning to turn into a political pariah with his criticism of Robredo for her meeting with Lacson, whom Trillanes has labeled a Duterte-enabler. Trillanes was allies with Sen. Lacson and Honasan against Arroyo. If reports are to be believed, it was Honasan who tapped Trillanes to become the leader of the Magdalo Group along with other offices of the AFP’s special operations units whom Honasan was familiar with having been their instructor at Fort Magsaysay.
At this point, Trillanes has nowhere to go except his Magdalo Group which has evolved into a political organization. However, with Lacson having the support of his seniors at the Academy, the end might well be near for Trillanes if the juniors who form the core of Magdalo defects to Lacson’s Reporma, which was founded by former General, Executive Secretary and Secretary of National Defense, Renato De Villa.
Trillanes had a promising political career if only he played his cards right. His weakness has always been his inability to decline the opportunity of being an attack dog. At this point, even his prospects of winning a Senate seat is bleak. Not only has public support for him waned but he has made too many powerful enemies who would want nothing than to put him down. This is usually the fate of  political attack dogs who have become rabid beyond redemption.",Politics
Opposition in DISARRAY as Trillanes slams Robredo and Liberal Party loses leadership clout,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/opposition-in-disarray-as-trillanes-slams-robredo-and-liberal-party-loses-leadership-clout/,"The public intellectuals who form part of the Opposition’s think-tank groups are so out of touch with reality. Even they aren’t aware of such a reality as evidenced by Inquirer columnist John Nery’s piece today “Warning: Trillanes”. Nery laments the “hysterical activism” of former Senator Antonio Trillanes that, he writes, is “undermining” both the leadership of Vice President Leni Robredo over the Opposition and efforts of their camp to “ensure the rejection of the Dutertes at the polls”.
To foster unity, not only among opposition groups — who by themselves will NOT have enough voters to win the presidency — but among all political groups who do not want any form of continuity for the Duterte regime, the focus must be on drawing a straight line between that big-tent political coalition and the mission. But while Trillanes’ political analysis is valid, that Robredo is the only possible unity candidate, his behavior since January this year has been baffling, and only serves to invalidate his previous work. In his triangle of options, the vice presidency and the presidency are out of his reach; but the last option is important, too: To earn a return to the Senate. He should recalibrate.
Trillanes wasn’t exactly part of the opposition before 2016. He was with the Nacionalista Party of Manny Villar. But, since then, President Noynoy Aquino (PNoy) granted him amnesty for the part he played in trying to oust former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA), he finally made his entrance at the Senate session hall. Trillanes relished his role as part of PNoy’s inner circle — at least, in his mind, he was part of that circle — which is why he was able to snag that back-channel negotiator role during the Scarborough standoff. He followed this up with the demolition job on Vice President Jejomar Binay.
Trillanes actually approached then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte with an offer to become his Vice-Presidential candidate which the latter declined. It was Alan Peter Cayetano who won that contest out of a combination of persistence and dangling of campaign financing. The Nacionalistas had three candidates for Vice-President, including Cayetano and Bongbong Marcos. The sight of three members of the same party slugging it out during the debate was painful to watch because it showed how immature the political system was. But the actual strategy then was to make the race crowded in order to deny Marcos victory. It didn’t work at least in the eyes of the public as evidenced by Marcos’ continuing appeal to voters for the 2022 race, either as President, Vice-President or Senator, as opposed to how fate had treated Cayetano and Trillanes. Both are now considered to be political pariahs. If you look at it closely, the same fate has befallen Koko Pimentel. They were the three Senators who orchestrated the demolition job on then Vice-President Jojo Binay.
While politics is addition, Vice President Leni Robredo can’t be given too much credit for meeting with Senators Ping Lacson and Richard Gordon. Of the two, it is only Lacson who has the gravitas to forge a coalition. In truth and in fact, the alliance of the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), Reporma and Aksyon Demokratiko is broader than any coalition the Liberal Party can come up with under the present political environment. Robredo is merely looking for a graceful exit because she is cognizant of the reality that she can become politically extinct by 2022. Her only option is to run for either Governor, Mayor or Congresswoman. The Camarines Sur Governorship is not hers for the taking since she will go up against Manoy Louie Villafuerte. The latter was once a member of the NPC so maybe there can be a deal brokered by the Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem in exchange for support in Region 5. But the reality is, the Lacson-Sotto tandem is in the best position to challenge whoever the administration candidates will be.
It’s the beginning of the end for Robredo and Trillanes. There are unconfirmed reports that Robredo will be scuttled by the Liberal Party. What Nery misses out on is how the two region mates are deceiving the public with their actions. Both have no chances of winning. Their only chance of winning exists in the minds of opposition die-hards who live with the memory of how Cory Aquino came to the Presidency. That in itself wasn’t a direct result of the broader-based coalition organized then. That was courtesy of Juan Ponce Enrile, Gringo Honasan, RAM and the US. It’s time for the “opposition” to wake up from its stupor. The end is near.",Politics
"TRADITIONAL Opposition make desperate calls for “unity”, ask Lacson-Sotto tandem to make way for Poe-Moreno tandem!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/traditional-opposition-make-desperate-calls-for-unity-ask-lacson-sotto-tandem-to-make-way-for-poe-moreno-tandem/,"To first give a bit of credit, blogger Katrina Stuart Santiago wields a pretty good portfolio of blog posts that lay out an intelligent critique of the state of the Philippine Opposition these days. In her particularly-cluey piece posted in March this year, she admits that, in this Game of Thrones that is Philippine politics, Duterte’s killing it. She writes that “despite thousands of dead bodies, the militarization of the government, billions in unaccounted public funds, the stench of corruption growing stronger by the day, and an epic failure of a Covid-19 response, this government has stayed afloat”. The more important part of Stuart-Santiago’s piece is her lucid call to action to the Opposition; that “the only way we even have a chance of winning 2022 is if we go back to basics: understand the enemy, battle with propaganda, set aside difference, unite on common issues, and get our shit together.”
Ok na sana, right? But then she goes on to field this tweet thread today where she beseeches the powers-that-be in the emerging New Opposition to take one for the team…
Just when you thought that there was one ray of light in the Opposition, it turns out she’s just like the rest of them – harebrained. A Grace Poe – Isko Moreno tandem will not win just as a Moreno-Poe will not either. Why? What have they actually accomplished as public servants? In 2016, Duterte was an outlier. He won because he focused on the issues bedevilling the public for the past 30 years. He also has the natural ability to connect with his audience. He focused on his areas of expertise and left those he had no or little knowledge of to the experts. What he had tucked under his belt was the transformation of Davao City. What does Poe or Moreno have?
Asking the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem to give way to a Poe-Moreno tandem is not only illogical but stupid as well. Why? Even if they won, they would have a steep learning curve. Proof? Look at the previous administration of Noynoy Aquino when it assumed office. It was described as a student council government. Ping De Jesus resigned even before he could warm his seat at the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). Contrast this with the Lacson-Sotto team each with their own network of appointees who already have experience in government.
A Poe-Moreno tandem wouldn’t even be appealing to voters because of their lack of vision. Both are illusions like the mirage of an oasis in the desert that recedes as you approach it. As for ground machinery all they would have is what remains of the Liberal Party die-hards. Nonetheless, there have been reports that Moreno-Domagaso is “it” for the Liberals, not the other way around. Word on the street is that Vice President Leni Robredo is about to be scuttled. The Yellowtard Opposition’s mouthpiece in the Inquirer, John Nery, has come out swinging against former Senator Antonio Trillanes yesterday. It was he who tweeted about the fractious factions in the opposition ranks.
The political environment has changed. The  Opposition still can’t read the tea leaves because they’re more stubborn than a mule with regard to “ideological purity.” The more realistic assessment is their campaign backers don’t find the Lacson-Sotto tandem palatable. They prefer Poe-Moreno for malleability.
The 2022 race will probably be a referendum on Philippine politics from 1986 to the present. We have had an Aquino book-ended thirty year period of the Yellows. Duterte is Marcos Lite. Now it’s up to the public to make up their mind what they think is best for them. The center now belongs to Lacson-Sotto. Not Moreno-Poe. The latter would find it hard to sell themselves to the public by claiming not to be Yellow. This is why Lacson-Sotto is being labeled as “Duterte enablers” by the Yellows.",Politics
Yellowtard brand of free-for-all “democracy” no longer an election-winning platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/yellowtard-brand-of-free-for-all-democracy-no-longer-an-election-winning-platform/,"Joel Ruiz Butuyan asks a question in his Inquirer piece “Two worlds at war” to which he already knows the answer. He just doesn’t want to admit it. Butuyan writes about “the existence of two different worlds in our midst” that the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte supposedly “exposed”. Interestingly though, he highlights an important contribution to the situation he laments by the very partisan camps that profess to champion “democracy” in the Philippines…
One very impactful cause of the dual realities in our midst is the kind of leaders who have caused extreme and longstanding disappointment to many of our countrymen. These leaders have perverted and destroyed our people’s view and experiences with our version of democracy, our brand of economic development, and all the other ideals upon which our people have looked up to for deliverance and salvation. The resulting disillusionment has caused our people to associate democracy with unresponsiveness, intellect with arrogance, and civility with insensitivity.
Indeed, the “restoration” of “democracy” in 1986 led to a free-for-all in anything and everything. This is why we’re in the mess we find ourselves in today. It’s been proven that Western-style democracy does not work in an Asian setting. I have no clue as to when colonial-minded public intellectuals and politicians will finally realize that it simply doesn’t and will not work for Filipinos.
Our ASEAN neighbors overtook us after they gained independence from their colonial masters because they had the advantage of the latter rebuilding what was destroyed during the war. In contrast, the US abandoned the Philippines by granting independence while retaining their bases and giving Japan a free pass with respect to war reparations. It was only during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos that vital infrastructure was built. The advantage then was we had a smaller population. How much has our population grown since 1986 when the Church became a governance partner through its alliance with the Yellows?
This is why it is ironic that certain comebacking Senators are taking potshots at the administration. They were in office before Rodrigo Duterte became President in 2016. What did they do during their tenure is the operative question? Butuyan is the same. Public opinion is divided. There are sectors whose members don’t care about the fatalities of the drug war because they believe it is justified. There are those in the Opposition who profess to believe in the value of human life but are just posturing and virtue-signalling for the sake of it.
The 2022 election is a referendum on what kind of governance the public prefers. Vice President Leni Robredo has harped on what she claims is not the true public sentiment about the support of citizens for the administration. Yet, the Opposition lost in the 2019 midterm election. The Opposition can’t claim they are the silent majority if they continue to lose electoral contests. Vox Populi is the principle at work here. The minority can’t impose its will on the majority. When they will get this is the question without an answer even now with just 10 months to go.",Politics
Philippine Opposition candidates fear “troll armies” because they lack the courage to COMPETE for domination,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/philippine-opposition-candidates-fear-troll-armies-because-they-lack-the-courage-to-compete-for-domination/,"Why blame “trolls” only on the administration? The good versus evil narrative doesn’t sell anymore. The proof of the pudding is in the eating as the maxim goes. If Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte didn’t achieve anything in the last five years, do you think he would still be popular even with his vaunted “troll army?” The opposition maintains they don’t have trolls. Yeah right. The pattern is more evident on Twitter to which they shifted to as their base after their defeat in 2016. They turned it into their own ecosystem. But this isn’t the case anymore.
Administration supporters have made the move to Twitter in the last three years. Why? Facebook has become the den of asininity. The algorithm immediately adjusts to the last thing you searched for. You can’t even get the news in your news feed anymore. Twitter’s algorithm is more balanced. It shows promoted tweets but not in the “in your face” manner of Facebook. It has also evolved to allow threads after increasing the character count of each tweet. It would be perfect if it allowed the editing of a tweet for typos. Twitter also allows the development of an organic following unlike Facebook where you have to pay in order to gain followers. Prior to monetization, Facebook likes and shares allowed one the capability to increase follower count by at least a thousand per week. I know this from actual experience.
As for the claim that the public is being unduly influenced by “trolls”, PhilSTAR columnist Andrew Masigan gives them too much credit in his piece “Understanding the inner workings of trolls” where he writes about the proliferation of “troll armies” that give administration candidates “an advantage”.
I have come to know the inner workings of trolls from first hand experience as an inquiring client. A messaging agency quoted me P5 million for a 30-day messaging campaign. When hired, the messaging agency contracts professional trolls who, in turn, manage their own army of “smurfs.” The more smurfs, the higher the fees of trolls, but rates start at P60,000 per month. The majority of smurfs consist of students and idle housewives. The smurfs typically operate ten accounts each. They are recruited by trolls and given a weekly allowance to spread the propaganda. Bonuses are given for a quota of “likes” and comments. This is why smurfs and trolls goad the public to engage. The budget dictates the number of trolls to be deployed in a campaign.
A script, however, can’t give you the spin on the story in such a way that the public would believe it even if you tailor the message for the demographic. What still sells is analysis based on facts and logic. There are those who brazenly mislead the public. This is outright propaganda and can be found mostly on YouTube. Ironically, mainstream media is also guilty of this with the prevailing fad among journalists of fancying themselves as “journalist-activists.” Reporters don’t report the news based on facts anymore. There has to be color or spin to it, or worse, their own opinion, which results in the editorialization of the news.
Media outlets are also in a bind because it’s expensive to promote their content on social media platforms. But public preference is still based on what the individual actually believes in. The editorial keel of the organization is what drives the individual to bookmark the URL. This is where the influence of the oligarchs come in. The Inquirer and the Star are pro-opposition. The Tribune is pro-administration while there are the in-between such as the Standard and the Manila Times.
I don’t buy into Masigan’s claim that the Opposition is the underdog. The Opposition disadvantaged themselves against the administration because they have no concrete proposition to offer the public due to their being oblivious to how the voter preferences have changed since 2016. Their defeat in 2019 was another wake-up call which they ignored. This is why they are the “underdog” and why theirs is a lost cause.",Politics
"Hopelessly fragmented Philippine Opposition no match for the vision, leadership chops, and mass appeal of Sara Duterte",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/hopelessly-fragmented-philippine-opposition-no-match-for-the-vision-leadership-chops-and-mass-appeal-of-sara-duterte/,"I fail to see what PhilSTAR columnist Boo Chanco is talking about referring to widespread poverty and hunger as claimed in the surveys in his piece “COVID as 2022 kingmaker?”. The number of the homeless living on the streets isn’t out of the ordinary. They may be homeless but they don’t look like they’re on the verge of death. What is unconscionable is how these morons still procreate without even thinking about what kind of future their child or children will have. Yet Chanco paints a shrill catastrophic picture writing about “hunger and poverty that reached horribly inhuman levels”.
Inflation is higher but that’s more a result of supply-chain issues due to the production capacity being halved as a consequence of the pandemic. What’s stupid is how the leftist-militant groups continue to carp about pandemic response. It’s as if the government is responsible for the Delta variant. The surge is global. The Philippines is no different to any other country in the world. We are in fact, one of the last to experience the surge. This is not to say that we don’t have morons for government officials. Unified contact-tracing system, adherence to test, trace and treat and the absence of a digitization plan is what the government needs to address if we are to move forward under the assumption that the pandemic is endemic. It doesn’t take a genius to figure this out.
Covid would definitely have an effect on the May 2022 election. But as Chanco said, he’s amazed that the public don’t blame President Rodrigo Duterte. He laments how “survey after survey is showing that the people are not blaming the Duterte administration” for their troubles. Why should they in the first place? Most of the problems faced in terms of vaccine rollout is on the local government units (LGUs) not the national government. The Opposition finds it convenient to target Duterte because that’s what they’ve been doing since 2015. It’s not working and will not work until June 30, 2022. As for the candidates, Chanco is frustrated that Inday Sara “Daughterte” is leading the surveys.
Nearly half of the people interviewed in one survey now consider themselves poor, but that sentiment does not translate to dissatisfaction with Duterte. He may just be able to transfer this positive sentiment to his daughter Sara, who is now leading all polls.
Thing is, Mr. Chanco, what can you do if that’s the public preference? If the people are unconvinced that Duterte is a failure, that’s on the Opposition and not on the people. This is classic Yellowidiot reaction to not getting what they want. The blame isn’t on them.
It looks like the cat is out of the bag. Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is running for President. Who his running mate will be remains to be seen but logically, it should be Senator Grace Poe. Sources tell me it is not Poe. Isko will definitely be the Yellow candidate for 2022 but under Aksyon Demokratiko. How the public will react remains to be seen after his formal announcement. Lito Banayo will be his campaign manager. This early, it’s obvious that he has the support of leftist-militant groups as they came out in force to defend him against the stupid show-cause order issued by the moron Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Ricojudge RJ Echiverri who, more than likely, was acting on his own.
It’s not surprising that Daughterte has an independent streak and wants nothing to do with the original Davao group if she runs. It’s not in her nature to be a robot. This presents a quandary for the administration because the coalition has to be maintained. The PDP-Laban resolution endorsing a Bong Go- Rodrigo Duterte ticket is the Duterte old guard protecting their interests. The President isn’t a political idiot. He knows when his subordinates are sucking up. A Duterte – Bongbong Marcos (BBM) ticket is still the best but if BBM isn’t inclined to be the VP candidate it presents a problem. Marcos must realize he can’t win on his own. He is too polarizing for the electorate and the oligarchs will unite against his candidacy because they have nightmares about losing the Marcos assets sold to them by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). If you were in their shoes, wouldn’t you do everything in your power to prevent the loss of your business empire?
Chanco discounts the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto ticket which still has the best chance of challenging the administration candidate. Isko is youthful but he is also inexperienced. There is no room for a learning curve if the administration candidate loses. The winner should be ready to hit the ground running on day one given that the pandemic is getting worse. It’s a question of experience in crisis management and governance under a very challenging environment. Isko will easily wilt during the debates as his glass ceiling is low. Lacson and Sotto may not be lawyers but they have the experience. Daughterte is a lawyer. Marcos was in Congress and the Senate so he’s on the same footing as Lacson and Sotto.
The election is now a three-way contest. It may become four if Robredo insists on running but she will only split the Opposition vote. It is actually Lacson-Sotto which can take away votes from the administration. The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) has taken away two weeks from the run-up to the October deadline for the filing of certificates of candidacy. Robredo will have to make up her mind soon. The same goes for Daughterte. Lacson-Sotto has the edge after declaring first as they’ve been in the news cycle since their informal confirmation. All of the declared and undeclared candidates have name-recall. Chanco himself resigns to the facts before him…
A disunited opposition will almost guarantee a Duterte 2.0. It doesn’t look like they will be able to agree on a common candidate. From the latest numbers, even Manny Pacquiao will not be able to divide the solid Mindanao votes for Sara.
Chanco’s fears aren’t unfounded. Even confronted with her dismal numbers, a rabid community of loyalists continue to hold up Vice President Leni Robredo as the Opposition “leader”. Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco writes in his piece “Run, Leni, run” that Robredo is “qualified to lead our nation”.
You won against all odds at a time when very few knew you, at a time when you barely registered in the polls. I believe you can do it again, this time when so much more is at stake for our nation, not least of which are justice and hope.
Fat chance, Mr. Lasco. What’s important is the platform. What the public is looking for is the way forward to remove the cloud of uncertainty hanging over their heads. It will be an issues-based campaign. It will also be a referendum on the Duterte administration. Like it or not, the incumbent has the advantage. Duterte won in 2016 as the underdog.

In an Inquirer “report” on “Governance prospects for 2022 and beyond”, a certain Dindo Manhit, “founder and managing director of Stratbase Group”, regurgitated the outcome of a “town hall” organised by this “institute” which “saw participants discussing a gamut of issues and concerns spanning the social, political, and economic landscape of the Duterte presidency, along with forward-looking analysis in light of the 2022 national elections.” Not surprisingly, enough space is reserved in this “report” for the all-too-familiar script…
On the state of our democracy, former ombudsman and Supreme Court justice Conchita Carpio Morales opined that the current landscape is anchored on the “policy of fear.” “Inaccuracy” is what best describes Mr. Duterte’s claims of achievements, she said.
Indeed, summing all these up, where is the promise of a “comfortable life” for Filipinos after five years? One cannot simply shrug one’s shoulders and blame the troubled times that have befallen the nation on the pandemic.
There has been a disconnect between our politicians and those in civil society since 2016. Civil society made its way to government as a result of the EDSA “revolution.” It began with the appointment of civil society personalities to government posts. It was supposed to develop a close working relationship between government, the private sector and the academe with the goal of reforming government and giving way to the needs of the private sector while the academe provided the research into reform measures benchmarked against best practices. What went wrong? The intentions were good but the maxim that the “road to hell is paved with good intentions” prevailed.
What were prioritized were the vested interests of the power blocs funding the non-goverment organisations (NGOs). This was how the oligarchs strengthened their power base by being able to get projects and contracts from the government. The privatization of government-owned and controlled corporations in vital industries and the sale of other assets was the hallmark of the adminstrations of Cory and Noynoy Aquino, Fidel Ramos and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. This is why the public is saddled with high power costs and a water service where everything is passed on to the consumer. This was what the President spoke about in his last State of the Nation Address (SONA).
In the opinion of this “civil society” group, the administration hasn’t done anything right. Never mind that the public has felt and seen palpable change compared to previous administrations which is why the President continues to be popular. If the claims made by the administration were false, the public would certainly react. Indeed, by the time the Aquino administration began its last year in office, the public was impatient. They couldn’t wait for their agony to end because there were daily reminders of how bad the situation was for them in terms of traffic congestion and a decrepit mass transport system.
The truth is any well-meaning appointee will find it hard to change the system if there is no backing from no less than the President himself. Career bureaucrats will make life difficult for any head who is out to institutionalize reforms. It is easy for the speakers of the Stratbase-ADR forum to analyze and criticize. But then give them government posts and you will see how they will fail miserably in their task or just carry out the instructions of their patrons to manipulate the system in order to gain advantages.
An example of the system being gamed is renewable energy. Meralco has been charging its customers a monthly amount for the feed-in tariff subsidy for renewable energy. The beneficiaries of this subsidy are companies which venture into renewable energy. Look at the list of companies in the energy sector -+ same old oligarchs. Nuclear is by far, the cleanest and cheapest source of power but the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant has been scuttled. Former Pangasinan Rep. Mark Cojuangco has been pushing for its upgrade and commissioning but this has fallen on deaf ears.
Meanwhile, the Malampaya reserves are about to run out and power demand is increasing. Service contracts have been awarded by the Department of Energy for exploration but none of the companies are moving. Why? They don’t have the technology and financial capability for exploration. Neither Shell nor Caltex is interested in Recto Bank because it is disputed territory despite the arbitral ruling. Manny Pangilinan holds the service contract for the Recto Bank field but Chinese companies are wary of partnering with him because of his anti-China attitude. It is no secret that Pangilinan is bankrolling the Stratbase-ADR think-tank which bears the name of one of his top lieutenants, Albert Del Rosario, the former Foreign Affairs Secretary during the Aquino administration.
If the country’s economy is to recover from the pandemic-induced recession, it will need more foreign direct investment. Cheap power and labor are two issues which foreign investors have been raising with government officials. The oligarchs are protecting their turf because they don’t want the economy opened to foreigners since their profits would be reduced drastically. It’s no surprise that Stratbase-ADR would give the administration a failing grade for its efforts in the last five years. This is what they would like the public to believe in order for the anti-Duterte oligarchs to get back in the economy’s driver’s seat.
The anti-Duterte oligarchs are behind the candidacy of Isko Moreno. He is their candidate. Moreno’s tone has changed in the past two weeks and he is being defended by the Yellows and the Reds. He has been receiving favorable coverage from the media entities owned by these oligarchs. He is their version of Duterte which they hope the Filipinos will buy for them to get power back.",Politics
Leni Robredo is leading history’s “most stupid” Philippine Opposition down a path to oblivion,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/leni-robredo-is-leading-historys-most-stupid-philippine-opposition-down-a-path-to-oblivion/,"The true state of the Opposition is laid out today by former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao in his Manila Times piece “Philippine democracy is in trouble”. Tiglao writes about how today’s Opposition is “the most feeble, most stupid opposition ever in our history”. Among other aspects of the problem with the “opposition”, his indictment of the media, in particular, by itself sums up their key intellectual shortcomings…
The Philippine Daily Inquirer continues its pathetic nitpicking against Duterte with all its fatuous columnists, open or secret members of the anti-Duterte Yellow Cult. Burdened by huge debts and the high salaries of its top people, Rappler should have died with a thousand cuts, if you believe its CEO’s claims, yet it’s still there with its inane anti-Duterte articles by unthinking, never-heard “thought leaders.”
Therein lies the rational explanation in how the Opposition was lazy when they were in power and in how, following that, they continue to be so out of power today. Their formula for winning back power has always been the same — vilify and destabilize. They deem the Constitution “sacred” but conveniently throw it out the window when they need to as in the case of the civil-military coup against then President Joseph “Erap” Estrada under the guise of “People Power” in 2001. Then they plead clueless as to why they lost in 2016 and 2019.
Nothing proves this point more than Vice President Leni Robredo’s statement yesterday on why she rejected the offer of Sen. Panfilo Lacson for a unification formula. Robredo claimed that the basis was for common candidates to be fielded but those who are found to be weak on the basis of surveys should withdraw and be replaced by stronger candidates. Robredo said this was unacceptable. Why? Because if she was found to be weak in the surveys, she would have to withdraw as well. The reality is, if there are two or more “opposition” candidates running for the top two posts, the chances of winning become slimmer because the vote is split. Lacson’s formula does not prevent Robredo from declaring her candidacy but gives her an exit strategy that saves face. Haven’t they learned their lesson from 2016 when Roxas made a desperate appeal for Poe to withdraw so he would have a better chance against Duterte? Robredo has only been in national politics since 2016. Lacson was first elected Senator in 2001 and has been reelected twice. He ran for President in 2004. Surely his experience and network trumps Robredo’s.
Lacson’s reaction to Robredo’s statement was succinct; he stood up to take the challenge. At least, he made the effort. Robredo did not even think about it in depth. Her posturing continues with her saying that she will only make a decision either in September or October. This will be too late. As it is, time is running out what with the latest enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) running until August 20. Robredo forgets that as titular head of the opposition, it is her duty and responsibility to offer the public an alternative to the administration in the coming polls.
Lacson and Tito Sotto aren’t the opposition. In fact, Robredo’s supporters have described them as “Duterte enablers.” Tito Sotto had no choice because as a member of the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), he had to abide by the decision of Danding Cojuangco. It is not as well known that Duterte was also close to Boss Danding. When Duterte finally decided he was running in December 2015, Boss Danding decided to withdraw his support for Grace Poe. By then, Cojuangco also had had enough of the infighting between Chiz Escudero and Neil Llamanzares over campaign funds. There are reports that the two actually brawled at one point. Lacson actually took a risk meeting with Robredo because he is also perceived to be Yellow what with his appointment as Yolanda rehabilitation czar in 2013. Robredo is again caught in a deer-in-headlights situation because she might not be aware that Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is the anointed of the anti-Duterte oligarchs. This is why he is moving to Aksyon Demokratiko.
The state of the Yellows now is so miserable because even Mar Roxas refuses to be dragged into the affairs of the party his grandfather founded. This goes to show the lack of principles among the so-called “leaders” of the opposition. Robredo was again playing the victim in her statement when in truth and in fact, she is actually struggling in her fight for political survival. At this rate, the Liberal Party might not even make it past October. The funding for 1Sambayan will eventually dry up or it will after it crowns Isko as its candidate under Aksyon Demokratiko.",Politics
Survey and analytics firms set to make big bucks as 2022 election campaign goes digital,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/survey-and-analytics-firms-set-to-make-big-bucks-as-2022-election-campaign-goes-digital/,"What’s in an OCTA? The research group is in the headlines again and making enough waves that PhilSTAR columnist Alex Magno described them as “busy”…
In the last OCTA Tugon ng Masa (TNM) survey, no surprising development was registered among those leading in the rankings. Sara Duterte pulled in 28 percent, Bongbong Marcos took 13 percent, Isko Moreno 11 percent, Grace Poe and Manny Pacquiao 10 percent apiece. These were the top choices tracked by other surveys and other polling outfits.
Congressmen want to probe its activities. But why? Only our esteemed honorables know. The OCTA Research Group made its presence felt when it came out with a political survey which was widely cited by mainstream media. The general reaction was, “OCTA who?” The firm is actually composed of members of the academe of the University of the Philippines (UP) and the University of Santo Tomas (UST). The country has a dearth of data analytics specialists. Data analysis plays a large-role in science-based decision-making. The last two enhanced community quarantined (ECQs) were based on the data crunched by the Department of Health (DOH). OCTA’s data is useful for mainstream media because those in the opposition use it against the government to criticize pandemic response. It is hard to criticize without numbers. OCTA now competes with the likes of SWS, Pulse Asia and Publicus in the political survey business. The more the merrier.
The Delta variant has thrown a monkey wrench into the political calendar. The Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem launch has been postponed to September 8. So with the impending transfer of Isko Moreno to Aksyon Demokratiko. This makes it very tight for the administration as well. Who will run? Will it be Inday Sara “Daughterte”? Bongbong Marcos? A Bong Go – Rodrigo Duterte tandem? The President is keeping rivals guessing.
The Opposition already has Isko “Yelorme” Moreno even if they deny it. Vice President Leni Robredo has painted herself into a corner. No sane financial backer will give campaign funds to her. This is both at the national and provincial level. Her gubernatorial run is also a difficult race because she would be up against the Villafuertes, the political overlords of Camarines Sur. It will not happen that there would a deal to be cut unless the carrot is attractive enough for Manoy Louie.
There are other candidates who are posturing in the administration because of Daughterte’s independent streak. You have Win Gatchalian and Sonny Angara looking at the Vice-Presidency. In the meantime, PDP-Laban has come out with an endorsement for Go-Duterte. But then, even the President can’t make his loyal aide win as President. This is all indicative of the power play in the President’s camp. The Davao Origs don’t want to give up power. If Daughterte runs, she will bring in her own team. This is a wise move on her part because she can’t be accused of being a figurehead leader being manipulated by her father.
Aside from the usual political theatrics, the biggest challenge is the campaign or rather, how to campaign? Rallies and sorties are out given the game-changing emergence of the Delta Variant. The advantage goes to candidates who can ride a big bike to go around the country. Anyone for a Zoom rally? This is where the barangays come into play. They will do the heavy lifting in the distribution of campaign materials and get the vote out on election day. Explainer videos will be produced for the candidates for the public to be informed of their platform. Three minutes or shorter is the norm.
In this kind of campaign environment, it’s essential to determine what’s working and what’s not. Survey companies will be raking it in. OCTA’s advantage is their relative youth. It remains to be seen if they are willing to work with administration candidates given that their academic backgrounds would make it logical that they be with the Opposition. The election will help the economy as campaign funds run into billions of pesos. This is pump-priming in another way.
The number one question which hasn’t been asked yet is if the Commission on Elections COMELEC has a plan for the conduct of the election under a pandemic environment? I don’t know if anyone has noticed but it’s only under the Duterte administration that the COMELEC Chair hasn’t made his presence felt. So much so that most people probably think James Jimenez is the COMELEC  Chair. What’s certain is we live in very interesting times. It will only get more interesting in the lead up to May 2022.",Politics
Traditional Opposition REALLY worried as disastrous fiascos under Leni Robredo leadership strengthen’s Lacson-Sotto 2022 bid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/traditional-opposition-really-worried-as-disastrous-fiascos-under-leni-robredo-leadership-strengthens-lacson-sotto-2022-bid/,"The Opposition appears egregiously divided among the ideological purists and the political pragmatists. Amang Rodriguez said politics is addition. How can the opposition win if they do not know how to add? John Nery’s column today, “Warning: Lacson”, comes on the heels of the latest public relations fiasco of Vice-President Leni Robredo which she herself lit because of the answer she gave her co-anchor on her Sunday radio program, as to why she rejected Sen. Ping Lacson’s “unification formula.” He is clearly worried. On the Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem’s play for a centrist positioning that is “neither pro nor anti” Duterte, he is “certain that this move to the center will play well with many voters”.
Yesterday, Robredo’s disastrous posturing was still in the news cycle which prompted Senate President Tito Sotto to tweet a screenshot taken by his Chief of Staff, showing that it was the Robredo camp which approached him by way of a text message from Robredo’s Chief of Staff to his, in order to negate the impression given by Robredo that the Lacson-Sotto tandem approached her and not the other way around.
The problem with the Opposition is that time is running out and so are their options at putting up a credible candidate against the administration. Former Ambassador Rigoberto Tiglao, in his column yesterday, pointed to the possible death of democracy in the country because of the asinine manner with which the Opposition under Robredo has been conducting itself in the past five years. Both Lacson and Sotto issued polite but obviously piqued statements in reaction to Robredo’s latest boo-boo. Both expressed disappointment because the proposal was shot down immediately during the meeting. Short of accusing Robredo of acting in bad faith, the two said that they expected the proposal to be thought over and then discussed again. In short, the unification formula wasn’t a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Lacson added that he just rose to the challenge seeing as how the Vice-President also met with Sen. Dick Gordon over a possible alliance for the 2022 polls.
Nery is again using Lacson’s record as a Constabulary officer at the defunct Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group under Col. Rolando Abadilla and his posting as chief of Task Force Habagat under the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission against him. It’s clear that the public are behind this given that Lacson has been elected to Senate each time he ran and won convincingly. Nery even admits to the promise in Lacson’s “positioning himself as ‘Heneral ng Bayan,’ the People’s General” considering how the “Duterte campaign in 2016 proved that an entire presidential run can rest on the peace and order issue, even though, at best, it ranks only seventh in the list of voters’ concerns”. Nery goes on to compare Lacson with former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada and his bid for the Presidency in 2010 when there is nothing in common between former subordinate and superior. Estrada was out for vindication in 2010. If Cory did not pass away in 2009, Erap would’ve established another record for being the only candidate who ran for President twice and won. Lacson’s case is different because he is offering himself as an alternative to the public given the dearth of credible candidates. He could easily win reelection to the Senate but chose to rise up to the challenge, as he himself put it, because it is his political valedictory.
Lacson and Sotto are both 73 years old. They would be 79 at the end of their six-year term if they are successful. Contrast this with the Vice-President who is only 56. In a way, Lacson and Sotto are giving the political pragmatists among the public a choice; would they prefer more of the same under a Duterte or Marcos Presidency, or would they opt for a measure of change if they vote for Lacson and Sotto? In essence, the Lacson-Sotto tandem is keeping democracy alive in the country as opposed to what the traditional opposition under Robredo is doing.",Politics
"Manila “achievements” pimped into service for Isko Moreno 2022 presidential run, ultimately BETRAYS Manileño constituents",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/manila-achievements-pimped-into-service-for-isko-moreno-2022-presidential-run-ultimately-betrays-manileno-constituents/,"You know it would come to the point that a puff piece praising Manila Mayor Isko Moreno would eventually be written. It was just a matter of time. In his PhilSTAR piece “The city of Manila acting like Singapore”, columnist Andrew Masigan describes Isko as a “transformative leader” gushing about how Moreno had “achieved more than expected in just two years. He is the transformative leader the city needed”. All this fluff would not be complete, of course, without the customary denigration of the “enemy”. Masigan goes on to write how all this is “[in] stark difference to how the pandemic was mismanaged by the national government”.
For sure, there is no downplaying the quantifiable achievements Isko has to show for in the capital city. It had regressed under two terms of former mayor Joseph “Erap” Estrada who promised to bring back its former glory as the Pearl of the Orient. It did help that Isko allied himself with then candidate Rodrigo Duterte. He ran for Senator and finished a respectable 15th place. Duterte is not one to let a slight slide and so come 2019, there wasn’t one member of Estrada’s extended family elected to office. Having interacted with the Mayor personally, one can’t discount his genuine concern for the poor because that is his provenance.
However, what does it say about him that he is willing to abandon the Manileños who voted for him on the basis of his promise that he will succeed where Erap failed by running for President? The premise is he can continue to serve Manileños if he wins as President because Malacañan is in the San Miguel district. But what if he loses? What Isko is exhibiting with his decision is he will not let an opportunity as big as this pass. Isko is fond of gambling which is probably an offshoot of his background; his early life was a gamble everyday. He probably thought that six years would be too long to wait for an opportunity to become the President. It certainly helped that anti-Duterte oligarchs have been looking for a viable candidate to run since the 2019 midterm election.
Monies have been pouring into Isko’s projects to bring back Manila to its former glory. Manny Pangilinan, the Ayala brothers, and Ramon S. Ang (RSA) have been funding these because they saw potential in Isko’s background as a narrative to sell to the public. Ricky Razon opted to keep the National Unity Party in an alliance with the administration but he also benefits if Isko wins because he  is now partners with the Ayalas in Manila Water. We have to be pragmatic enough and admit that politics is a business and businessmen are investors in politicians. The danger here is Isko’s malleability should he win.
Duterte was egged on to run by former President Fidel Ramos (FVR). Tabako wasn’t enamored with the prospect of a Binay, Roxas or Poe Presidency. He disdained former Preident Noynoy Aquino (PNoy) which is why he wasn’t even seen at the services for the son of the woman who made him President. Duterte acknowledged his debt of gratitude to FVR but has been independent from Day One. FVR could get into Malacañan but he couldn’t influence Duterte. Isko, on the other hand, was chosen because he will follow. A politician has to contend with the realities of his existence. It is the way the system has been set-up but the politician still has the choice of how he will play the game to balance out the interests of the people vis à vis that of oligarchs who wield power. The other danger with Isko is he is also in bed with the Reds. His conversion mostly likely happened when he was at the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) with Judy Taguiwalo and Noel Leyco.
Manila as the capital serving as the microscosm of how a Domagoso Presidency would actually transform the Philippines into another Singapore is the packaging. This is why one of the most grizzled veterans of political wars is Isko’s campaign manager. Lito Banayo has been on a winning streak since 1986 with the exception of the Arroyo administration. Banayo has the advantage now of running his own show unlike in the past when he had to contend with rival factions within the candidate’s campaign. It will be interesting to see how Banayo will work with Cesar Chavez and Noel Leyco. Isko will have to undergo a makeover to prepare him for his biggest role to date. He will need to be ready to answer questions about Presidential matters. The challenge is to sell him to Visayas and Mindanao voters. He will be fighting a battle on two fronts as the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is no political lightweight either.
The even bigger challenge is if the Duterte-Marcos pairing materializes for the administration. Isko will find it hard to go up against Inday Sara “Daughterte”. Unlike him, Inday doesn’t speak without thoroughly calculating what impact her statement will have. She is very calculating, self-effacing, and has the charisma to win over voters. She also trumps Isko in terms of experience and educational background. Isko’s greatest challenge is how not to be perceived as the Trojan Horse for the old traditional opposition. As early as now, he is being labelled as such. This takes the pressure off the Lacson-Sotto camp which bolsters their claim of being the centrist option. How all of these will play out will be an excellent case study for how campaigns are run in the Philippine political landscape. But, for now, we have the best entertainment we can get under these very trying times. We get the added benefit of being able to shape our future as well. Anyone for Pangulong Isko?",Politics

STATEMENT BY MAYOR INDAY SARA DUTERTE ON SENATOR GO AND PRESIDENT DUTERTE TANDEM AND THE PDP FIASCO
I would like first, to apologize to my mother for this statement. Second, I ask the nation to read my message from the point of view of a politician and nothing else.
1. The President, very recently, personally confirmed to me that he will run for Vice President and Senator Go as President. It was not a pleasant event. I was left with two letters endorsed to me by the President for consideration one note explained why I should endorse the Go-Duterte tandem and the other suggested that I take in Senator Go as my Vice President.
2. I strongly suggest to the President and Senator Go to own up publicly their decision to run as a tandem. If they can confirm it privately, then I do not see the reason why they cannot be candid about it to the public. They should simply present to the people what they can offer to our country and how they can help our fellow Filipinos. I respectfully advise them to stop talking about me and make me the reason for them running or not running.
3. Senator Pimentel and Mr. Ronwald Munsayac should stop blaming me for the sad state of their political party. It is not my fault that no one among you is a leader worthy of the respect of the majority. Do not blame me for the sitcom that your party has been reduced to.
4. I am not a “Last Two Minutes” person. I think, I organize, and I implement accordingly. In the meantime, I refuse to be a political punching bag for a party in complete disarray.
Maraming salamat mahal kong mga kababayan.
Mayor Inday Sara Duterte
If she does decide to run it will be her own decision with the blessing of her mother. The rift will have to be resolved by former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) who will be the final arbiter. Go has become like Ramon Ang (RSA) to Danding Cojuangco and his son Mark. If the Go-Duterte bid pushes through, Bongbong Marcos (BBM) will run, but with who? This opens up the possibility of a Trillanes move by BBM where he runs as President with Duterte as his adopted running mate. Whatever tandems are born out of the chaos between the opposition and the administration, it will be up to the people to decide who their choices will be. This makes the 2022 election an open race where issues will dominate the campaign which is actually good.
Go is a no-sell as President. A four or five-way race for the top two posts would open the possibility of a compromise candidate making it — think Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto whose packaging is neither administration nor opposition. The Senators will make a show of scrutinizing the proposed 2022 national budget. This again favors the public who believe that public health and education should be the top priorities in the midst of the pandemic. Sen. Ping Lacson has resigned as Vice-Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for this very purpose just the other day.
Daughterte is not the type who will be dictated upon not even by the pater familia. If she’s decided, she will form her own coalition. If not, she will just sit on the sidelines and focus on her Davao City constituency leaving the national political scene to those who are most interested in keeping power.",Politics
Leni Robredo has FAILURE written all over her face,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/leni-robredo-has-failure-written-all-over-her-face/,"The more critical thinkers among the public have noticed Vice President Leni Robredo’s speech pattern to be mostly incoherent. She can’t organize her thoughts verbally in a manner which she can be understood by her audience. Most wonder why this is considering she is a UP graduate of Economics. Even her grasp of her major isn’t good. Yesterday she went after the Department of Health (DOH) over the adverse findings of the Commission on Audit (COA) by saying “bakit tayo mangungutang kung marami palang pera na hindi nagagastos?”
It’s not as simple as she paints it to be. You can’t compare government borrowing to the operations of a department. She can’t get it in her head that government is not a for-profit entity. It is in the business of delivery of public services. Robredo also took up law at the Ateneo De Naga and from all accounts, it took her either two or three tries to pass the bar. Not indicative of being a good lawyer and it shows. She is hopelessly inarticulate. Figure that out. Being articulate is a basic requirement for one expected to competently argue cases before a court. It is hardly surprising that, most of the time, Robredo does not cite legal provisions in her critique of the administration.
The DOH missive is an example. A seasoned lawyer would normally put it in the context of what laws were violated. But, in her case, it was about public debt. She has been Vice-President for five years. She still has not grown into the job. Her speech pattern is based on non-government organisation (NGO)-speak. Actually, her office is akin to a trading outfit; it serves as a broker of donations from the private sector and NGOs for the poorest of the poor. These are whom she describes as “nasa laylayan ng lipunan,” literally “fringes of society”. Despite all of her efforts and her being in the news cycle 25/8 courtesy of her lamestream media allies, her job approval and trust ratings are still average at best. This can be attributed to the lack of sincerity in her manner of speaking. She does not come across as credible.
It doesn’t help that she affects the colegiala manner, which is something you don’t really expect to see in a woman in her mid-50s who is Vice-President and an economist-lawyer by profession. Most of the projects under her office are PR-oriented. They are not scalable enough to be institutionalized in government agencies. For example, take those vaccine drives that she puts under her personal brand but use the vaccine allocations of the local government units (LGUs). Why the need for such if it is the mandate of the LGUs from the national government to begin with? Post-Marcos, she is the only Vice-President to deliver a contra-SONA which is usually done only by the minority in the Legislature. The Vice-President is part of the Executive branch so what business does she have criticizing the branch of government she belongs to? In this respect, Robredo is not being faithful to the functions of her office as stipulated in the Constitution. She was given a Cabinet post by the President but didn’t buckle down to work which is why she was fired ignominiously. She was given another chance by being appointed head of the inter-agency committee on illegal drugs but she turned it again into a PR-show-cum-crusade against the administration in its drug war.
Robredo also fails at being the titular head of the Opposition. Look at the miserable showing of their Senatorial slate in 2019. Up to today, she still has not made a categorical statement on whether or not she is running for President in 2022. She is making it appear that she does not have the time to focus on making a decision because she’s busy with her so-called pandemic response efforts. Yet she admitted to meeting with Sen. Panfilo Lacson and Senate President Tito Sotto in a bid to out up a unified slate for 2022. She was again caught dealing with them in bad faith when she made it appear that she was approached when, the fact is, it was her Chief of Staff who reached out to his counterpart at Sotto’s office. Her supporters’ battlecry has been “Let Leni Lead”. But how can she lead when she does not manifest basic leadership qualities?
Perhaps the most glaring disconnect is in Robredo’s continued claim that she won over Bongbong Marcos in the 2016 race. Marcos has consistently come out as the second or third choice in both Presidential and Vice-Presidential preference rankings in all surveys. Robredo can’t even manage to scratch in a comparable showing. The ugly truth is Marcos won that race. How Robredo emerged the winner only she knows. The writing on the wall is clear.

The chilling effect on a DESPERATE Opposition of a Duterte-Marcos 2022 bid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/the-chilling-effect-on-a-desperate-opposition-of-a-duterte-marcos-2022-bid/,"A  Bongbong Marcos – Inday Sara Duterte or Duterte-Marcos ticket is the most feasible for the administration because of the voter base of each camp. You have the north and the south and everything else in-between. This is true for either the father or the daughter. For the Opposition, pushing for the candidacy of Leni Robredo is a no-brainer; no brains for them, that is. Isko Moreno is running as the anti-Duterte oligarchs choice, as of now. Why as of now? Isko has made mistakes since his State of the City address which reveals his weaknesses. I don’t think he actually contracted Covid. This may well have been a ploy for him to lie low since the heat was on him after being singled out by the President.
“Chief Political Analyst” Antonio Contreras is into complicating the simple in his Manila Times piece “A (not so) hypothetical scenario and what the political opposition needs to do”. Contreras believes that the rift between Duterte and Daughterte is all for show. He writes, “all of these, including Duterte-Carpio’s public scolding of her father, may just be well-choreographed moves to set the stage for a Marcos-Duterte (father or daughter) tandem.” Guess again, Chief. Do you honestly think that Inday Sara “Daughterte” would surround herself with her father’s men should she run and win the Presidency?
Robredo is a sock puppet. Daughterte is not. She will not betray her father but she won’t follow him blindly either. If we go by the quality of public statements alone, we notice that Daughterte is in a class of her own. Her thrashing of her father and his loyal aide was classic. But even better was her description of Koko Pimentel and Ronwald Munsayac. That put those morons in their proper place. If Robredo and Isko both run, they will cancel each other out.
It will be an interesting Presidential debate series if the cast is composed of Ping Lacson, Daughterte, Isko and Robredo. Daughterte is a better match for Lacson. Isko and Leni will only provide comic relief. At this point, the Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is the better alternative for voters if they aren’t inclined to vote for the administration bet. On experience alone, even if you combine Isko and Leni’s, they still won’t be able to hold a candle to Lacson-Sotto. Lacson’s survey numbers are still low because there is no formal declaration yet. But after September 8 and through January 2022, you will see a bump upwards.
The hot-button issues candidates need to address are the economy, jobs, public health and education, in that order. These are their primary concerns in the midst of the pandemic. The South China Sea dispute has been reduced to a non-issue because of the US debacle in Afghanistan. Former Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario can’t milk this anymore to prop up their failed 1Sambayan coalition. The administration still has the advantage because they have power of the purse and there is still time for Congress to pass their priority bills which addresses the public’s concern over the economy and jobs.
The “Chief Political Analys”t should advise his associates at Digivoice that they should put up at least a website so they have even a small measure of the credibility that they’re sorely lacking.",Politics
Cash-telo for QC Mayor o Vice Mayor? Huwag Po! Huwag Po!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/cash-telo-for-qc-mayor-o-vice-mayor-huwag-naman-sana/,"Kung ang nakikita niyo sa Facebook lang pagbabatayan niyo lang sa pagboto niyo sa 2022 ng mayor o vice mayor ng Quezon city, baka magkamali kayong iboto si Councilor Winnie Castelo.
Ang mga manaka-nakang pagpapakitang gilas nito sa harap ng kamerang gamit sa Facebook videos at mga litrato ang nagtatago ng mga kahindik-hindik na mga gawaing di nararapat para sa isang pinuno ng lungsod.
Nuong halalan ng 2019 lamang nakita na ang tunay na kulay ni Castelo at kung gaano kawalang kwenta ang mga salitang binibitawan.
Tatlong taon nang nakakalipas nang maghayag ito na tatakbo bilang Vice Mayor ng Quezon City. Katambal siya dapat ni dating congressman Bingbong Crisologo.
Matapos mag-iikot at magpakitang nagtitipon para sa pagtakbo bilang Vice Mayor, bigla na lang itong naglaho at tumakbo na lang bilang konsehal sa District Two ng Quezon City.
May mga nagtanong sa distrito niya na mga kaibigan ko kung ano ang nangyari sa suportang natanggap ni Castelo at mayroon din sa kanilang nagsabi na malamang napa-atras kapalit ang malaking halaga.
Bilang isang matagal nang communications consultant sa politika, ang sabi ko maraming dahilan ang pag atras ng isang nagpakilalang kandidato.
Sabi ko maaaring kulang sa pondo o di kaya pangit ang resulta ng survey. Pwede ding napakiusapan at pwede ding nga na nakipag CASH-sunduan.
Sa mga yan, hindi ko masasabi ng tahasan kung ano talaga ang dahilan pero given na may mga nakapaligid kay Castelo na kilalang hustler at raketero, di ko ma eliminate ang ikahuling posibilidad.
Sa pag-iikot ko sa district two, lagi ko ngang nadidinig ang bansag kay Castelo na Cashtelo.
Anya ng isang matandang political observer, bantayan mo kung ano ang papansinin ni Cashtelo at malamang may pakay yan dun.
Sabi niya, “Mula sa trapik dahil sa construction ng MRT hanggang sa mga away away ng subdivision, pansinin mo. Binaril nga nyan sarili niyang pwet para lang makasuhan ang isang sheriff   at para gumulo lalo ang kasong kaugnay ng isang writ of possession.”
Dagdag pa ng nakausap ko, “Huwag na nating pag-usapan yung mga kwento sa kongreso nung congressman pa yan. Kung sa mga reporter may nababayaran para mag-ingay, ganun din sa kongreso..”
Pero, kung ganun, kataka-takang walang naibalita tungkol sa kung ano man ang pinatutungkulan ng kausap ko.
Kung sabagay, di na bago ang kagawiang paghahatag sa mga reporter para magtikom ng bibig at ang pagpapayola sa mga editor o producer na huwag maglabas ng negatibong balita.
Kung tutuusin, minsan lang nadawit ang pangalan ni Castelo sa napakasamang balita.
Ito yung tungkol sa pagkakapatay sa boyfriend ng babaeng kapatid ni Konsehal Winston na si Nanette Castelo Daza.
Nung unang lumabas ang balita tungkol sa pagkapatay kay Noel Orate, a district manager of United Laboratories, nasabing MURDER ang nangyaring pagkakabaril sa kanya ng limang beses habang nasa loob ng bahay ng mga  Daza sa Maningning Street, Barangay Teachers’ Village East in QC.
Ang salarin ayon sa mga naunang report ay si Allan Robes na nakita ng mga pulis na may dalang baril habang palabas ng pinangyarihan ng krimen.
Sa tinutulan na hatol ng piskal sa Quezon City, naging homicide na lang ang kaso kay Robes imbes na murder.
Paano naging ganun, anya ng mga kampamilya ng napatay na boyfriend ni dating Congresswoman Nanette Castelo Daza?
Kung self-defense, bakit kailangang limang beses barilin? At bakit may baril na dala si Robes sa pamamahay ni ex-Congresswoman Nanette?
Sa kalaunan ng pagdinig ng kaso laban sa asawa ng pamangkin ni Konsehal Winnie, pinalipat ng mga kamaganak ng napatay na si Orate ang hearings mula sa Quezon City papuntang Makati City. Ayon sa mga Orate, nangangamba sila na gantihan ng mga Castelo at mukhang hawak nila ang batas sa Quezon City.",Politics
Philippine Opposition petty politicking causing Filipino suffering under COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/philippine-opposition-petty-politicking-causing-filipino-suffering-under-covid-19-pandemic/,"Who is really politicking? The administration or the Opposition? Professor Randy David writes in his Inquirer piece “Politicking in the midst of a pandemic” of President Rodrigo Duterte’s address to the nation the other night saying that it is “insensitive, it is irresponsible, it is disheartening—and it leaves one wondering if the country’s highest public official has any notion at all of the gravity of the ongoing pandemic, and how it is affecting every aspect of our people’s lives.”
No president in his right mind should use his weekly meetings with his COVID-19 team to talk about his political plans when he finishes his term. But that is exactly what President Duterte did last Thursday in his address to the nation. He laid out what he intends to do if he is elected vice president in 2022.
David, however, is being selective in his indictment of the Duterte government by cherry-picking an episode and expounding on it out of its proper context. Indeed, it is actually the Opposition and not the incumbent administration he should be picking on. It began in 2016 and never stopped — not even to unite the country to combat the pandemic. The Opposition is, in fact, responsible for vaccine hesitancy. If there was no vaccine hesitancy then we wouldn’t be hitting record-high case numbers in the midst of the Delta-induced surge. Unfortunately, Opposition “influencers” like “social media expert” Noemi Dado who have tens of thousands of followers spread misguided opinions about vaccines that misled many people.
Make no mistake, though. The administration is also at fault to some extent what with Senator Bong Go allowing hubris to get the better of him. The Opposition is also responsible for this development because they made Go popular by linking him to anomalies and the stupid opposition Senators calling him to the Senate “in aid of legislation.” When hubris hits you hard you begin to have delusions of grandeur like aspiring to become President.
I cringe at the thought of Bong Go as President. Majority of the public is of the same sentiment. The loyal aide is also dispossessed of gravitas. You cannot become President on the basis of “ang bisyo mag-serbisyo.” Even if he graduated from the De La Salle University (DLSU), I don’t think he has the intellectual capability to carry out the functions of the Presidency. You need to be politically-savvy to get legislation past Congress. Go’s power emanates only from his role as gatekeeper. That’s about it.
Those in the Opposition like David who believe that Inday Sara “Daughterte’s” statement the other day is part of the family zarzuela are not giving credit where it is due. Sara does not embrace the reputation of being the subservient daughter. She is, in fact, the family’s bastonera; the one who keeps everyone in line or makes them toe the line whenever they stray.
The revelations made at the Senate inquiry the other day landed Go in hot water. His reaction was to ask Health Secretary Francisco Duque to resign. That’s code for being the fall guy. The problem with the Opposition is they make it appear that their hands are clean when there were also anomalies during their time. Corruption goes both ways. The only difference now is we’re seeing more accomplishments because public funds have been cascaded and projects have been completed despite the nagging issue of absorptive capacity because of the bureaucracy. Whoever wins the Presidency should seriously address this.
The truth is the Ease of Doing Business Law hasn’t achieved its purpose because the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) has been consumed by the bureaucracy as well. Before this law, departments and agencies already had citizens’ charters but few were compliant. The perennial problem has always been enforcement. This is why the public should actually scrutinize candidates’ platforms instead of falling for gimmicks like free housing for informal settlers and the usual PR stunts of traditional politicians like Vice President Leni Robredo. If you think that a Mayor with only three years of experience is qualified to become President you’re dead wrong as well.
Platform of government is what’s important in these very trying and challenging times. What we need is innovation and out-of-the-box solutions to the problems we face moving forward in living with Covid in our midst. We’re now in the homestretch of the deadline for filing of certificates of candidacies. The political picture will get clearer in a month’s time. The Opposition should buckle down and do its homework.",Politics
Yellowtard “thought leader” Manuel L Quezon III’s flawed wishful thinking that Duterte’s coalition is self-destructing,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/yellowtard-thought-leader-manuel-l-quezon-iiis-flawed-wishful-thinking-that-dutertes-coalition-is-self-destructing/,"Leave it to the desperate traditional Opposition to still be hopeful of a sudden change in fortunes at this late a stage in the lead up to the 2022 national elections. In a post on Facebook, former Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) thinks he’s smelling blood much like a shark does going after its prey. MLQ3 suggests that the political camp of President Rodrigo Duterte is imploding as any administration would under its leaders’ missteps and “inability to corral their coalitions”. He is quick to interpret the drama currently engulfing administration party PDP-Laban as its dying pangs and gloating about how “no one expected the ruling coalition to fragment and fight amongst itself like it’s doing now”. This reading too much into events in order to extract “insights” that match his personal bias reveals itself in the incoherence in what MLQ3 writes here…
The only phenomenon more interesting than the current Autumn of the Patriarch, is the seeming (to me, anyway) inability of Ferdinand Jr. to recapture what he lost in 2016 –that aura of looming inevitability– in which the political class seems reluctant to engage him, to the extent that his own sister has been dangling him as a potential veep to Inday Sara –a humiliating recognition of reality which probably has a healthy dose of malicious enjoyment on the part of his sister. Satisfying that may be, it still leaves the various strands of the old Center and Left as outliers.If one looks at public opinion, for the ruling coalition, the worst is over; there is a kind of opening for a [Stockholm] Syndrome to work: having survived, there is a weird solidarity possible to pitch. And plenty of room to pitch more of the same as an antidote to taking a risk.
This is the very definition of a Hail Mary pass in American colloquialism. Which is why other Senator-sharks are joining the feeding-frenzy. One administration supporter echoed his sentiment by tweeting that one bad egg such as Senator Bong Go, in this case, isn’t enough for him to withdraw support from Duterte considering what he has accomplished in five years. MLQ3 is too blinkered by his unchecked personal bias to take into account the “discount” the public is willing to extend to the President considering how former President Noynoy Aquino set the bar so low. This is a fact the Yellowidiots refuse to accept. Like it or not, the images of Yolanda, Mamasapano, and Dengvaxia are still fresh in the public’s mind. Add to that the fiasco Leila De Lima managed to get herself into, the rigged impeachment “trial” of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona, the subsequent Napoles-DAP scandal, and Senators being hauled off to detention after they convicted Corona. The end result is a higher threshold for corruption given the Aquino Cabinet graduated with the President while the Duterte Cabinet is already minus its original appointees.
Then there’s the track record of the Yellowidiots when it comes to prosecuting the Marcos cronies. None, not one of them, landed in jail. Most of them are dead now but they all came back from exile to face the music. Contrast this with former-COMELEC-Chairman-now-fugitive Andy Bautista who remains holed up in the US. Look at the case of former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada who was offered exile but refused. He self-destructed on his own hubris by not living up to his promise to Manileños. Instead of going out in a blaze of glory, Erap couldn’t even defeat Isko Moreno who had the tacit backing of the President when he ran.
The Yellowidiots’ hypocrisy and sense of entitlement always does them in. If MLQ3 smells victory at the polls on May 2022, he’s sorely mistaken. Maybe that will be for the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem but very likely not for Isko-TBA and Leni-TBA. TBA to be announced.",Politics
Could either an Isko-Leni or Isko-Pacman tandem become a reality for the Opposition in 2022?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/could-either-an-isko-leni-or-isko-pacman-tandem-become-a-reality-for-the-opposition-in-2022/,"Manila Mayor Isko Moreno is back from a Covid-induced hiatus. I don’t think it was really Covid but more of a tactical retreat after having been the subject of a full-frontal attack by no less than the President himself. If you believe his campaign manager Lito Banayo, he gained political points for that. Unfortunately, we are not in any position to conduct independent focus group discussions (FGDs) to test that assertion. At a groundbreaking for one of his projects yesterday, Isko was spotted sporting a t-shirt with the “God First” logo. This will most likely be his campaign trademark. If Grace Poe will not agree to be his running mate then it makes sense that either Leni Robredo or Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao will be up for consideration.
Banayo has praised Robredo in two previous columns. There was a test event held at the Quirino Grandstand where the two shared the limelight. Isko as President is non-negotiable as this was what he conveyed to the camp of Sen. Ping Lacson when they met. This means that Robredo will have to run as Vice-President again. Considering the alternative of becoming the Mayor of Naga City or Congresswoman, the races of which she can easily win as opposed to a gubernatorial run where she would be up against the Villafuerte’s machinery, this would be the best alternative for the incumbent Vice-President. The problem is there is Robredo’s inherent weakness as against what Pac-Man brings to the table in terms of his popularity and being a native son of Mindanao. Pacquiao is more palatable to the masa as Vice-President than he is as President. But he has excess baggage of his own in the person of Koko Pimentel who is bent on having him run as President. Could Pac-Man break away from the clutches of Pimentel so he can chart his own political future?
Sen. Bong Go has formally declined the nomination of PDP-Laban for him to be their standard-bearer. This does not necessarily mean that the path is clear for Inday Sara “Daughterte” to run as President given she still has unresolved issues with the pater familia. She has retained only two of her father’s original aides to be part of her campaign, if ever. Jun Evasco and Peter Tiu Lavinia are the two originals who were marginalized by the Go- Salvador Medialdea Palace faction. Perhaps Daughterte trusts them more than the aide who has become the second most powerful man in the country today as the Presidential Gatekeeper. Banayo has indicated that they will not consider 1Sambayan as a legitimate convenor group. This means Robredo will also have to take her name off for consideration as the “common” opposition candidate for President.
Truth be told 1Sambayan lacks credibility to begin with. This is precisely the reason why all the potential candidates it named begged off only hours after their announcement. The Opposition has hard decisions to make between now and October 8. If the Isko-Leni or Isko-Pac-Man tandem does become a reality, the anti-Duterte vote would be a toss-up between the ticket led by Isko against the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem. The latter is not open to any compromise given they have crossed their Rubicon and decided to run whatever happens. The advantage is really on their side given the two are political veterans with the experience to match. A possible split in the administration ranks, where Marcos would run if Daughterte doesn’t or even if she does, makes the 2022 election anyone’s race.
The reason for this is the pandemic environment. Filipinos are wary of their future and this would be the first time that they will listen more to the plans of action of candidates instead of indulging in the usual theatrics of petty political rivalry as they have been wont to do in the past. Lacson-Sotto already has the advantage because they will be the first to formally declare on September 8.",Politics
Controversy surrounding Bong Go “protégé” Christopher Lao highlights Philippines’ dysfunctional civil service system,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/controversy-surrounding-bong-go-protege-christopher-lao-highlights-philippines-dysfunctional-civil-service-system/,"The brouhaha at the Department of Budget Management (DBM) caused by Senator Bong Go’s protégé Christopher Lao, former Undersecretary at the Presidential Management Staff–Office of the Special Assistant to the President, has brought to fore the issue of how political patronage and the bureaucracy contribute to the culture of corruption in government. It’s not wise to speculate on the outcome of the investigation into his alleged involvement in extortion but there is the issue of the appointment of unqualified individuals to government posts. The concept of civil service is the bureaucrats would be appointed on the basis of qualification standards and promotion given on the results of performance evaluation and continuing education. But this is not the case with our government. Undersecretary and Assistant Secretary positions are given out on the basis of the candidate’s “MBA” — May Backer Ako. This works both ways in case Sen. Franklin Drilon is reading this. His brother Cesar, has been a long-term appointee at the country’s de facto embassy in Taiwan, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO).
Senator Ping Lacson, for his part, has disclosed in several fora that he is not for new taxes in a bid to increase government revenues. He would rather ensure that the national budget allotments are spent for the specified purpose and that the practice of pork barrel funds for Senators and Congressmen is stopped. His proposal of adopting the zero-based budget process focuses on the need to determine outcomes after the time period for the allotment has expired. This is a variation of his proposed Budget Reform and Village Empowerment (BRAVE) Bill which specifies allotments of development funds to local government units (LGUs) up to the barangay level which is not subject to the control of the national government or the Congressmen of the LGU.
The development funds would be released on a quarterly basis to each local government unit (LGU). Under the bill, provinces would receive P500M – P1 billion per year, cities up to P200 million per year, municipalities P50 million to P100 million per year and barangays up to P3 million to P5 million per year. The local development fund (LDF) for each province, city or town will be based on the 50 percent of the prescribed amount for first-class LGUs, 60 percent of the prescribed amount for second-class LGUs, 70 percent of the prescribed amount for third-class LGUs, 80 percent of the prescribed amount for fourth-class LGUs, 90 percent of the prescribed amount for fifth-class LGUs, and 100 percent of the prescribed amount for sixth-class LGUs.
Lacson is also the first to propose the digitization of the bureaucracy in order to minimize corruption and speed up transactions of the public with government departments and agencies. This is essential in moving forward with the mindset that the pandemic is endemic and that lockdowns should be granular instead of covering a large area which hinders economic activities.
The Opposition, on the other hand, continue to indulge in politicking which is detrimental to the public interest. Vice President Leni Robredo’s “solutions” are nothing but PR stunts designed to make her popular but without much impact in addressing the needs of the public during this challenging time. Lacson’s scrutiny of the 2022 budget serves a specific purpose because if it happens that he and Senate President Tito Sotto emerge as winners in the May 2022 election, this is the budget they will be working with for the remainder of the year. This is why it is imperative on the public to focus on the issues in this election and not the sideshow that politicking brings. If only Vice President Leni Robredo would present a platform of government to the public like Lacson does. It’s easy to fall into the trap of negative campaigning but at this point, there is simply too much at stake. We need to find innovative and out-of-the-box solutions to the problems we face.",Politics
What REALLY motivates Antonio Contreras whenever he defends Isko Moreno in his Manila Times column?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/what-really-motivates-antonio-contreras-whenever-he-defends-isko-moreno-in-his-manila-times-column/,"The Chief Political Analyst gets all worked up in his Manila Times piece today “Moreno’s past and Duterte’s present”. Antonio Contreras writes about how President Rodrigo Duterte “demeaned and diminished” Manila Mayor Isko Moreno by referring to his past as a sex movie starlet and his posing in provocative photos dressed only in his underwear.
What is more fundamentally galling and plain offensive, about all this is the manner in which the President had to resort to this level of sliming his political enemies. There is really something so bereft of reason for our public discourse to be polluted by a president who would descend to the level of slandering a perceived political enemy not on the basis of what he does as a public official, but on what he did for a living when he was younger.
You can sense his blood pressure at boiling point while writing the piece as you read it. I’ve often wondered how an academic like himself could lack consistently lack objectivity when it comes to analysis. He does claim he is a “political scientist”. As such, one should deal with the data at hand and not make his personal opinion the basis of his conclusion.
First, it was Isko who initiated the blind items against Inday Sara “Daughterte” and Duterte to begin with. This was part of the campaign to build up his public image prior to his formal declaration as a candidate for President. His tirades began after his State of the City address. He attended the inauguration of the Clark International Airport terminal that weekend and his presence was even acknowledged by the President. Is that indicative of malice on the part of the President? It is no secret that Isko was adopted as part of Duterte’s senatorial slate in 2016. He was included in the official party to the President’s visit to Japan. After the one-year ban on appointments expired, he found himself Chairman of NorthRail. When he couldn’t perform his functions at the Government Owned and Controlled Corporation (GOCC), he was promptly transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) as an Undersecretary. No secret also is that Isko had the blessings of the President to run against Joseph “Erap” Estrada even if it was his last term. Duterte doesn’t forget any slight. He plays the long game. He waits until the time is right to get even. Notice how not one member of Erap’s family won in 2019 despite Duterte and Daughterte endorsing the father and the two brothers.
You wonder why Contreras drags Mocha Uson into the picture. Uson is not running for President. Her appointment is political. Like it or not, it is Presidential prerogative at play there. Mocha’s previous career as a sex advice columnist and vlogger isn’t the issue. If this were the case then Contreras should make a toe-to-toe comparison for objectivity. We all know politics is theater as well. What of Isko making Manila, God first as his slogan? Isn’t that a bit hypocritical for someone who has a penchant for gambling? It’s an open secret that Isko frequented the Solaire casino even before he became Mayor. There are also the cases which have been filed against him for graft and corruption on the matter of ghost employees.
Contreras appears bent on focusing on the President’s sexual proclivities. But don’t we all have the same? The frailes had affairs with nuns and lay women (no pun intended) there. You have the high-society scandal of Paco Ortigas being accused by his estranged wife of having an affair with her best friend and banging their househelp at the same time. Erap’s extended family is an open secret. Chavit Singson beat up the boyfriend of his mistress and allegedly hit his penis with a hammer repeatedly. Kris Aquino has had affairs with Philip Salvador and Joey Marquez and publicly flogged both after she was done with them. Contreras himself has a predilection for good-looking men whom he praises to high heavens such as Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar and Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla. Now he’s defending another one in the person of Isko. Isn’t it about time that the Chief Political Analyst looked at himself in the mirror and maybe, just maybe, come to terms with his own sexuality?
Let’s face it, our politicians are human beings. As such, they have their own sexual preference and proclivities. Each of us have our own. We can’t hold them to a higher standard than ours. The origin of Duterte’s tirade against Isko is political, not sexual. Isko asked for it. He got what was coming to him. That’s part of the rules of the political sandbox he’s playing in. The operative rule is one should be able to take as good as he gives it. The other is one should be responsible for the consequences of his actions. Contreras should also come clean about his sexuality if he wants to keep any semblance of his self-respect as a Chief Political Analyst.",Politics
A theory on why Leni Robredo was smiling during the funeral of her husband Jesse Robredo,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/a-theory-on-why-leni-robredo-was-smiling-during-the-funeral-of-her-husband-jesse-robredo/,"“They say the presidency is destiny. Perhaps the tribulation that the Vice President had to endure is how the universe is strengthening her for the most difficult job of her life.” With this premise PhilSTAR columnist Andrew Masigan deems it fit to claim that Leni Robredo is ripe for the Presidency in 2022. In his piece “Leni on the right side”, Masigan insists that Robredo “is on the right side of democracy, human rights and due process. She is on the right side of the West Philippine Sea dispute. She is on the right side of good governance, decency and humanitarianism.” Evidently, Robredo’s cheering squad have learned no lessons from 2016 and 2019. They are banking on the very same losing position yet again.
I never liked Leni Robredo since her rise to prominence in 2012 after the death of her husband Jesse who was, at the time, Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). I never liked Jesse either. I was a frequent visitor to the Bicol region in the 90s because I had business to oversee there. We put up the first marine products processing plant at the Camaligan Fishing Port Complex. This was a small fishing port by the bank of the Naga River. There wasn’t much fish being landed. Leave it to the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority to construct fishing ports in some areas where it isn’t even viable. It’s a money-making project whenever that is the case. But still, like BDO’s slogan, we find ways. Octopus landed on the Eastern seaboard of the country are larger than those on the Western seaboard. We had to balance out our size breakdown for our buyers. It was better to process in the provinces because labor was cheaper and we could avoid having to deal with quality issues in Manila on account of the long travel time from the landing areas to Navotas.
Jesse Robredo was being touted as an excellent local government unit (LGU) executive but you don’t hear that from the natives of Naga. His hand was in every viable business in the city, including the central transport terminal. Girls as young as 15 years old were available from pimps for tourists and natives alike. There was also drugs in steady supply, mostly shabu and marijuana. Naga still had a large number of informal settlers. The situation was worse in Daet, Camarines Norte, so you had the people there going to the more progressive Camarines Sur to find work. Jesse established Kaya Natin shortly after Noynoy Aquino won the Presidency. Robredo was more of a Mar Roxas acolyte. He belonged to the Balay faction. But he also had a moist eye on 2016. His plan was to test the waters in 2013 and run for Senator. If he won, he would consider a Presidential run in 2016. Jesse believed that Mar Roxas wouldn’t be popular enough to win the Presidency. He wanted to be ready with an organization and a machinery. This was Kaya Natin.
His plans were cut short by his death in the plane crash. That incident was bedevilled with inconsistencies. How did his security and aide survive with a broken arm? Why was there no autopsy of the fatalities? Why did the British technical diver who discovered the wreckage die from an apparent rubout? The theory is the security aide shot Jesse first then waited until the plane was near the Masbate coastline after which he proceeded to shoot the two pilots before jumping off into the open sea. What was the motive?
Robredo had been building up dossiers on government officials involved in illegal drugs and gambling. This was found out by Undersecretary Rico Puno who belonged to the Samar faction in the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. It was precisely the reason why he was given that appointment. The dossiers were part of Jesse’s grand strategy to become President in 2016. He had the image and packaging having won the Ramon Magsaysay Award. He had the support of the non-government organisation (NGO) network and civil society. He was a La Sallite. He resonated with the masses.
Recall how Leni had to seek the intervention of then Justice Secretary Leila De Lima to prevent Undersecretary Puno from opening and entering Jesse’s office at the penthouse of the Landsbergh Place condominium along Tomas Morato which was also the Robredo residence in Manila. That condominium is owned by them. The office at the penthouse unit was where Jesse kept all the dossiers he built up as DILG Secretary. It’s an open secret that the reason for Leni’s running for Congress was to keep political pressure on Jesse’s dummies for them to surrender the assets they held in trust for Jesse to Leni. This was probably the reason why Leni couldn’t stop herself from smiling in that now famous photo of her with top government officials standing by Jesse’s bier. She was finally free and with money to boot.
Leni only has a combined experience of nine years in politics. Her recent run-in with Senators Tito Sotto and Ping Lacson over “unification” bears out her inexperience. She hasn’t been able to unify the opposition despite being its titular head. Their disastrous showing in the 2019 midterm election is proof that she doesn’t have the voter base which “won” her the Vice-Presidency in 2016. If there was any logic to this then it should follow that Marcos wouldn’t place second or third in any Presidential or Vice-Presidential survey. But Leni is consistent with her single-digit ratings.
At this point, Leni is in a serious quandary because she doesn’t have the financial backing behind Isko Moreno, who is the nominal opposition candidate anointed by the anti-Duterte oligarchs. Leni running would take votes away from Isko. Worse, voters could shun the both of them and go with Lacson-Sotto instead whose tandem is actually the more viable option for those who are not inclined to vote for either a Marcos or a Duterte for the two top posts. Politics is always addition and all politics is local. Leni would also not have an easy time if she runs for Governor of Camarines Sur because she would be going up against the Villafuertes. It is for this reason that she is taking that long to decide. Even if she does, I don’t think she still has an exit strategy in place. Maybe she can win as Senator on the Aksyon Demokratiko slate.
The case of the Robredos is what usually befalls those who are evil and diabolical to the the point that there is nothing sincere about their character. This is why she and Jesse were actually a perfect match. Jesse played his cards wrong and so has Leni since 2016.",Politics
Opposition “journalists” dishonestly liken situation in Afghanistan to that of the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/opposition-journalists-dishonestly-liken-situation-in-afghanistan-to-that-of-the-philippines/,"This is a bit of a stretch. Joel Pablo Salud in his piece “It’s perfectly fine to sympathize with the Afghan people, but…” published on Licas News writes that “Afghan people and Filipinos today share one thing in common: both find themselves at a crossroads. Both must decide their people’s fate. And while Afghans are hard-pressed to stand against the Taliban, Filipinos, too, must realize their own responsibility to push back against Duterte’s tokhang regime.”
Saying the Philippines and Afghanistan are in the same boat just to be able to hit at President Rodrigo Duterte. This is why “journalist-activists” have little or no credibility at all. They don’t take into account public sentiment. What is important is only their own views. It’s ramming it down the public’s collective throats. There is also the issue of the lack of due process. We have seen this before with former Presidents Ferdinand Marcos and Joseph “Erap” Estrada. People power was “institutionalized.” Yet it is nothing more than an extra-judicial and extra-legal means of ousting a legitimately elected President from office.
Whatever these “journalist-activists” think, the Philippines is still a democratic country. The basic freedoms under the Bill of Rights continue to exist. There is no concerted effort by government to stop the public in the exercise of these basic freedoms. Leftist-militant groups are under pressure from the government but their links to Communists are there for the public to see. The public has made their judgment as well. The Anti-Terror Bill is not a fascist tool but helps the government protect the public from terrorists and terror attacks.
Salud would’ve been better off writing about the threat posed by Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorists being an Islamic Emirate. This is serious because terrorism has waned the past years mostly due to ISIS being defeated by US forces and Bin Laden’s death a few years earlier. It also helped that ASEAN banded together to clamp down on the activities of these radical groups in their respective countries. Salud and his clique of left-leaning bohemians styling themselves as public intellectuals rings hollow like an empty drum. The opposition to Duterte hasn’t been able to present a solid case to the people in the past five years.
The truth is the government has been making gains against the communist insurgency both in the field and in the mainstream with their front organizations led by the party-list groups in Congress. It’s about time the public realizes that these leftist-militants are no different from termites that infest houses and slowly eat away from within. It is about time they are permanently eradicated from society. This is why there should be a concerted effort amongst the public to make them aware that they shouldn’t vote for these pests again on May 2022.",Politics
Inquirer columnist Winnie Monsod MISLEADS her readers into thinking that women make better national leaders,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/inquirer-columnist-winnie-monsod-misleads-her-readers-into-thinking-that-women-make-better-national-leaders/,"I have nothing against women. Hell I love women. Period. I worship at the altar of the woman that is her body and soul. That’s how much I love women. The adage that you can’t beat them, can’t live without them is true; depending on how much bullshit you are willing to accept. To say however that “Women-led countries do better against COVID-19” as Winnie Monsod assets in her Inquirer piece is a dishonest stretch. Indeed, considering she is an “economist” Monsod commits the biggest sin of “data science” — equating correlation with causation…
Summary statistics: The mean (average) number of COVID-19 cases for the period under consideration was 19,064 for the F-led countries and 26,468 for the M-led countries; the mean number of deaths was 1,107 and 2,681, respectively. That’s what the raw figures showed. So on the face of it, the female-led countries experienced fewer cases and fewer deaths.
The backgrounder to this, she writes, is a study conducted — by women, she makes sure to point out — following “the big deal media made over the relative success of seven women leaders–Frederiksen of Denmark, Marin of Finland, Merkel of Germany, Jakobsdóttir of Iceland, Ardern of New Zealand, Solberg of Norway, and Tsai of Taiwan–on their performance (number of deaths per 1,000) in dealing with COVID-19”.
See, just because “statistics” show that “female-led countries experienced fewer cases and fewer deaths” does not necessarily mean female leadership is a cause of better COVID-19 pandemic management outcomes. That fact, of course, does not stop Monsod from issuing her shrill conclusion, that “women leaders have steered their countries more successfully in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.”
As if that were not enough to seriously mislead her readers, Monsod reveals the true agenda of this blurb at the end: “Women like Vice President Leni Robredo and Sen. Leila de Lima, who have shown their worth, have been very badly treated by this government. We, the Filipino people, have to correct this situation. Soonest.” Mareng Winnie, you are predictable, as always.
The idea that Leni Robredo and Leila De Lima are at par with the likes of Angela Merkel is a reach. An overreach, in fact. A friend and I have been discussing what truly ails the Filipino. We’ve come to an agreement that it is basically a socio-cultural dysfunction. Some psychological too. The definition of success is moving over to the other side of the social divide under the general classification of the haves and the have-nots. Women have been stereotyped as the weaker sex. I truly believe this is not true. How many men have been taken down by women? A lot. The casualty count is high.
The Philippines is, contrary to tradition, a matriarchal society. Look at PNoy and Duterte. Both had strong women for their mothers. Yet both are a contrast in character and personality. I have always been for gender equality. I don’t have any qualms about the sexual proclivities of Leila De Lima and Leni Robredo. It becomes an issue because of the standards they have to comply with as public officials. De Lima initially denied her relationship with her driver cum bodyguard. She admitted to it later on on Mareng Winnie’s program. Robredo continues to deny her relationship with Bolet Banal even if it is obvious. This is plain and simple hypocrisy.
Both cannot measure up to Angela Merkel who is one of the longest-reigning German Chancellors. She succeeded Helmut Kohl at a time when Germany faced the difficulty of reunification. She took the mantle of leadership for the European Union in addition to her leading the Germans. She took on the likes of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and other European contemporaries during her term. She has kept her simple lifestyle all throughout.
One of the reasons why we fail as a country is our love for status symbols. We don’t have an efficient mass transport system because a vehicle is a status symbol. The public is enamored with celebrities. This is how Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla landed in the Senate. Millennials haven’t come to the realization that this is a bad practice because they indulge in the same. They cater to the establishment for job opportunities and security. In the process, morality and ethics are thrown out the window. Fake it until you make it replaces the maxim of continuing education and hard work as pathways to success. Post-graduate degrees are sold and bought openly in public educational institutions. Since President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted, we have progressively become a nation of morons. Professionalism is practiced by only a few. The same is true with civility.
Monsod obviously favors De Lima and Robredo because they are in the opposition. If there is any female deserving of Monsod’s accolades, it should be Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. She ousted a popularly-elected President and instituted fiscal and economic reforms which laid the groundwork for growth. She kept her silence throughout the five years she was detained by PNoy. She ousted the sitting Speaker of the House even if she had less than a year left in her term as Congresswoman. She continues to play the role of kingmaker in the political scene.
What is wrong with the country isn’t only about the political structure but also the socio-cultural hierarchy. There is no concept of equality and equanimity. We have no right to know about how De Lima and Robredo conduct themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms but as public officials, there is a minimum standard they should comply with which they are both guilty of violating not only as public officials but as members of the Philippine bar as well.",Politics
Century Peak Tests President Duterte’s Resolve on Reclamation Ban,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/century-peak-tests-president-dutertes-resolve-o-reclamation-ban/,"It seems proponents of reclamation projects are out to test President Rodrigo Duterte’s resolve a few weeks after saying he had put a stop to such projects because of corruption.
“You know, itong sa (this) Manila Bay na reclamation, thousands have applied but because of the corruption that I’ve heard early last year, there’s no more processing of papers,” he said in a speech at the Philippine National Police headquarters in Quezon City on Friday, June 25.
“Hininto ko (I stopped it) and it has caused the big companies lots of money,” he added.
Duterte did not elaborate on specific companies or local government units applied to pursue reclamation in the famous Manila landmark. But he implied that some entities were bribing government officials.
“I told you, do not give money to the people in government. If I know you have given even a single centavo, I will throw your application to the waste basket and I have done that and I am doing that every day,” he said.

Apart from the 174 hectare reclamation project that threatens to destroy the Mindanao Sea, another reclamation project on Manila bay is being pursued with gusto by a mining company.
Sources say that Century Peak (Metals) Holdings Corp. (Century Peak) is ignoring Duterte’s seemingly hard no against reclamation in Manila bay.
Century Peaks reclamation project will occupy 1,330 hectares of the bay, with 1,043 hectares on the Cavite side and 287 hectares on the side of Parañaque City.
The project will affect 178 local government units including Las Pinas, Paranaque, and Cavite.
The Pambansang Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (PAMALAKAYA), a fisherfolk organization, says more than 700 families in Cavite will lose their homes and livelihood from fishing.
It was also claimed that Century Peak’s gargantuan reclamation project will destroy mangrove areas vital no only to the marine ecology in the area but also comprises one of the area’s main defenses against storm surges as well as flooding.
There are fears that it will block the Parañaque River, Las Piñas River, Zapote River at  Molino River. With these natural drains blocked, there are concerns that the resulting floods will damage the homes of more than two million residents of Paranaque, Las Pinas at Bacoor cities.
According to records from the Philippine Stock Exchange, Century Peak’s chairman is Wilfredo Keng. It is the same company suspended by DENR Secretary Gina Lopez in 2016 because of alleged violations in connection with the Rapid City Nickel Project at Casiguran Nickel Project in the Dinagat Islands.
If Keng’s Century Peak manages to break ground for its reclamation project, the Duterte administration’s growing number of detractors as well as political opponents will pounce on this as another instance of flagrant corruption.
The administration is already reeling from corruption allegations in connection with the flagging of the Department of Health and OWWA by the Commission on Audit.",Politics
#NinoyIsNOTaHero trends as Commission on Audit (COA) “flagging” campaign mounted by Opposition FAILS,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/ninoyisnotahero-trends-as-commission-on-audit-coa-flagging-campaign-mounted-by-opposition-fails/,"The hashtag #NinoyIsNOTaHero trended yesterday on the 38th anniversary of his death at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport. It is obvious that the Filipino people have had enough of that narrative. They have repudiated the proponents of such in 2016 with the loss of Mar Roxas to Rodrigo Duterte and again in 2019 with the defeat of the entire Senatorial slate of the opposition.
What is the endgame of the Opposition for the 2022 election? The purists are looking to Leni Robredo to run as their standard-bearer. But there is another candidate-in -waiting in the person of Isko Moreno. Isko has found a new home in Aksyon Demokratiko. A shell political party in the same category as a shell or holding company in business. It was founded by Raul Roco for his Presidential run in 2004. Since then, it has been mostly dormant but still convenient whenever needs such as Isko’s arises. The Opposition have their backs against the wall because Robredo hasn’t been able to build up a base in her five years as Vice-President, no matter what she does. The proof is in Bongbong Marcos, whom she “defeated” in 2016, who continues to do better than her in any survey for President, Vice-President and Senator. Marcos is electable while she is not.
What is pathetic is how the Opposition haven’t changed their strategy one bit. COA (Commission on Audit) “flagging” has become the trend since last week. The public is being agitated by the claim that billions of pesos in public funds have been wasted by several departments and agencies in the midst of the pandemic. This is meant to complement the Opposition’s support for ayuda or social amelioration each time an enhanced community quarantine is declared as in the past two weeks. This strategy is straight out of the old anti-Marcos playbook. The Opposition’s reason is if they were able to topple a powerful dictator then using this method, it should work again this time against a less powerful President who doesn’t even have the power to rule by Presidential Decree. This is stupid doing what stupid does.
Evidently, the Opposition thinks they can rebound in 2022 using the pandemic as a wedge against the administration. Public sentiment is they have had enough of the divisiveness that the Opposition have been promoting. It is fairly obvious that Filipinos are satisfied with the President’s performance. Just look at the surveys. Inday Sara “Daughterte” continues to top all of them. The President is the top choice for Vice-President if he runs. Meantime the Opposition continues to spew out motherhood statements like “we cannot have six years more of this kind of governance”. Robredo’s biggest problem is no matter how hard she tries to project a smart image, she still comes off as stupid to the public. But what can you do? You can’t squeeze blood from stone. She is what she is.
Other candidates looking at a Presidential run should realize that negative campaigning will not work this time. No matter what statement or sound bite about corruption, malfeasance, or anything anti-administration will register only with the minority and not the majority. Robredo is again proof of this. She had been doing the same thing over and over again for the past five years and continues to expect a successful outcome each time. This is the very definition of stupid. It hasn’t raised her numbers because the public is tired of bitching and whining.
Clearly what the public wants is action or a plan of action. And if the Opposition continue to miss it, they must face the fact that the public continues to acknowledge what Marcos built during his time — specially the hospitals without which we would be worse off now as we cope with the Delta-induced surge. It’s time for the opposition to wake up to the smell of their own crap. Three Aquinos are buried next to each other at the Manila Memorial Park and not too many Filipinos give a damn anymore. This is the truth they need to learn to handle sooner than later.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s lame bid to re-brand her camp to “Working Opposition” insults the intelligence of Filipino voters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/leni-robredos-lame-bid-to-re-brand-her-camp-to-working-opposition-insults-the-intelligence-of-filipino-voters/,"The bigger news yesterday was Sen. Ping Lacson resigning as Vice-Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Per the resignation letter he sent to Senate President Tito Sotto, he resigned because he wanted to have more time to scrutinize the proposed 2022 National Budget. Lacson has become the scourge of pork-loving legislators ever since he was elected Senator. Lacson needs more time to give the 2022 budget laser-like focus since it’s an election year budget and he’s running for President. The other news of the day was the Opposition rebranding itself as the “Working Opposition”. I’ve lost count of how many times they have undergone this exercise in the last five years. There has also been increased political noise for groups who “want” Leni Robredo to run for President.
The Commission on Audit (COA) flagging brouhaha hasn’t died down yet. Sen. Richard Gordon has issued a subpoena to former Department of Budget Management (DBM) Undersecretary Christopher Lloyd Lao to appear before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee which is looking into the alleged overpriced purchase of face masks and face shields are the start of the pandemic. Lao is a protégé of Sen. Bong Go. It’s safe to say that Gordon is going on a fishing expedition because it’s the season, and I don’t mean the holiday season. It’s political theater again at the Senate. Barring any last-minute change, the Lacson-Sotto tandem’s formal launch is on September 8. Lacson has indicated his displeasure over the President’s defense of embattled Health Secretary Francisco Duque and his offensive against the COA. This began the flagging versus flogging contest we have been witnessing the past week.
If the Liberal Party and its allies are now the “Working Opposition” what of the Lacson-Sotto tandem? We Need A Leader, as Tito Sotto has said. It is evident that Lacson is not going on a fishing expedition like Gordon. The national budget has been submitted by the DBM and Lacson is going to give it the fine-toothed-comb treatment he usually does but more so now that the COA has laid the predicate for possible anomalous transactions and unobligated funds which shouldn’t be the case with the lead department tasked with pandemic response. It is one thing to make public accusations bereft of proof of malfeasance. Credibility is established when there is evidence to back up one’s allegations. This is where the “Working Opposition” is weak because they generally practice the maxim of “it doesn’t necessarily have to be true. It just needs to look like it.”
Whatever faults Lacson has based on public perception, he can’t be as accused of using his position as a bully pulpit the way other Senators have done so in the past. Perhaps the better label for Lacson and Sotto is the Responsible Opposition which does not start shooting until there is definitive proof that graft and corruption occurred. Democracy is about checks and balances ideally. But the larger goal is nation-building. Leni Robredo’s “Working Opposition” has done nothing to contribute to nation-building as they had been bent on destruction and destabilization since their fall from power in 2016. We can’t expect the same level of scrutiny if ever Isko Moreno makes it to the Presidency. Aksyon Demokratiko is like the illegitimate child of the Liberal Party.
This is why it is a shame that Lacson has to choose between the Presidency or the Senate. The same is true with Sotto who is termed out. If the tandem does not make it in 2022, they will have to wait another three years before they can run for office again by which time they will be 75 years old. We are running out of competent leaders because the present political structure is defective. The platform of the Lacson-Sotto tandem hasn’t been made official but hopefully it includes charter change. A unicameral parliamentary form of government is more advantageous in terms of cost, efficiency and productivity. The Prime Minister as head of government and head of state offers consistency and continuity. If one loses his bid to become Prime Minister, he is still a member of parliament and can continue in a fiscalizer role as part of the opposition.
The composition of the Senate in 2022 is worrisome because the most senior members would be Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid. Both are outstanding in their silence during their terms. Both are not as assiduous as Lacson when it comes to job performance. These are not ordinary times we live in as we face the lingering threat of the pandemic like a Sword of Damocles hanging over our collective heads. What we need is less of the irresponsible “Working Opposition” and more of the Responsible Opposition as best exemplified by Lacson and Sotto who are neither pro-Administration nor pro-Opposition but simply pro-Philippines.",Politics
Opposition “journalist” compares Duterte to Ramos because the Opposition offer nothing,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/opposition-journalist-compares-duterte-to-ramos-because-the-opposition-offer-nothing/,"Former President Fidel V. Ramos (FVR) and President Rodrigo Duterte (RRD)? Columnist Boo Chanco compares the two in his PhilSTAR piece “Incoherent” today just for the heck of it. He first issues the tired old critique on Duterte’s form writing how his “streams of consciousness broadcasts” in his national broadcasts “reduce our confidence in government at a time when every effort must be made to increase it.” And then, out of nowhere, Chanco brings up Tabako…
If FVR were president at a time like now with the pandemic, he will make sure he has a calming effect on people. He will be focused on solutions, not cursing and fat-shaming his political enemies.
I didn’t think pandemic response would make a comeback as an election issue but it’s like the ghost of Christmas past. The Delta variant wreaked havoc in India last March, Indonesia recently, and now the US. Americans thought they defeated Covid only for Delta to ruin their party, literally. It was bound to come to our shores eventually as the virus is airborne. It has and our case counts have it at record-high levels. Delta is vaccine-resistant. It has a shorter incubation period, a higher viral load and is more contagious than the original virus. The only logical response is for people to get vaccinated and avoid large gatherings and, when going out, double-mask and observe physical distancing. This is the ideal of course but since this is also the Philippines, we know very well not all will comply.
The Opposition exploded another bomb last week which is the scandal at the Department of Budget Management (DBM) in relation to its purchase of personal protective equipment (PPEs), masks and shields. The link is to close aide and Senator Bong Go and the President, naturally. The Senate “investigation” is ongoing. It might even go all the way up to the President they say. Fine. The public has reacted with either skepticism or anger, based on political affiliation. The mud has been flying in both directions since last week. Even the President himself has gone down to the level of the Senators because he is piqued.
Chanco’s comparison has no basis because Ramos and Duterte were presidents over different periods. FVR is now in his 90s. His last public outing showed his age in his manner of dressing and speech. Incoherent he has also become. Not everybody can be like former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile (JPE) who is in his 90s but is still in full possession of his mental and intellectual faculties. The pandemic response could’ve been better, of course. We could’ve had better officials. That’s always the case. What should be pointed out is public conduct of government officials. The Presidential Spokesperson studied at the London School of Economics but he’s hardly professional in his demeanor. His gender confusion is not an excuse because there are others like him who conduct themselves with dignity and respect in public. But this is the nature of Philippine politics.
The Opposition claims the moral high ground but they aren’t exactly the epitome of morality. Just look at the personal lives of Leila De Lima and Leni Robredo. Region mates and both prone to the frailties of women of a certain age. When they itch, they can’t resist the urge to scratch it and not with any non-living scratcher either. Good manners and conduct have disappeared as the years have gone by. There is no more sensitivity to the public’s reaction. The public themselves are equally guilty of behaving like Romans at the Colosseum watching gladiators battle it out to the death. It’s political bloodlust. That’s entertainment folks.
If we really want to progress as a country then our level of political maturity should improve. By leaps and bounds. Inday Sara “Daughterte” is well-versed in the art of the terse reply. It gets the message across and hits the intended target, hard. She does not even publicly make a statement preferring infographic instead. Should the target respond, she doesn’t. She leaves it at that. This is how it should be done. Contrast this with Manila Mayor Isko Moreno who has a penchant for blind references. It’s probably excusable since his background is showbiz where blind items are the norm. Still, it shows his lack of gumption or balls. You need to have balls to become President.
An important virtue Chanco fails to consider in his piece is leadership. Surely Tabako has a better educational background than Duterte but his six years in office was relatively a failure. Aside from his dismantling of PLDT’s monopoly on telecommunications, there isn’t much more to crow about. Even the centennial celebrations were clouded by corruption. Nothing ever came out of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program. The Armed Forces of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits System (AFP-RSBS) went bankrupt during his watch. There wasn’t much infrastructure built. MRT-3’s convoluted ownership was another product of his administration. Power costs went up because of the Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). The Ayalas and the Lopezes got the water concession. It ended with a thundering thud because of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. How then can Ramos be better than Duterte? Chanco also forgets that it was Ramos who pushed Duterte to run in 2015. This is another practice we should be rid of; comparisons.
What the Opposition should be focusing on now is what they will offer to the public as an alternative platform of government and not continuing to destabilize the administration which is about to step down. But morons can’t help themselves because they prefer the shortcut rather than the hard work. The “good” versus “evil’ narrative is all played out. It’s time for a new strategy. The Senators should focus on realignment of the budget to make it more beneficial for the public in this time of great need instead of engaging in politicking. There is bound to be backlash in the May polls. Those who are running shouldn’t be surprised when they lose. Like it or not, the administration has achievements which have had an impact on the public. This is what they are up against.",Politics
Opposition still using obsolete “good” versus “evil” rhetoric as a lazy alternative to a real campaign platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/opposition-still-using-obsolete-good-versus-evil-rhetoric-as-a-lazy-alternative-to-a-real-campaign-platform/,"PhilSTAR columnist Boo Chanco seems to be losing faith in the youth. But the surveys he cited in his piece today “Faith in democracy” were done abroad, mostly in Europe. It doesn’t automatically apply to Filipinos in the same age group he cites…
The Center for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge found out that satisfaction with democracy is in steepest decline among 18 to 34 year olds in almost every global region. The researchers also found out that young people are most positive about democracy under populist leaders of both left and right.
This new generation of voters in democracies across Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific “are less concerned with the value of democracy as an ideal, and more concerned with its functioning in practice – including the ability to address problems of youth unemployment, corruption, inequality, and crime.
The 21-45 age group is the largest demographic numbering 40 million Filipinos. No survey company has focused on them which is why we have no idea what their sentiments are. I have met thirty-somethings who are pro-Marcos and pro-Duterte. Their belief is based on the oral history of their elders of how the country was better off during the Marcos era. But this is in the National Capital Region (NCR) where anarchy and chaos reigns for workers who commute everyday. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) hasn’t really done a good job with mass transport integration. The opportunity was there during the lockdown but without an intermodal mass transport system based on route rationalization there will be no improvement. The Pasig River Expressway shouldn’t be built. The Pasig River is better off as is as a mass transport waterway for commuters travelling from east to west and vice-versa. This was its purpose back in the day and it should be revived.
Chanco again concludes that Duterte is a failure writing that he “has failed to deliver on economic outcomes big time.” The economy was doing well before the pandemic. A ratings upgrade was the result of sound fiscal and economic management policies under the Economic Development Cluster of the Cabinet led by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. The tax reform program has resulted in a wider revenue base. The ratings upgrade lowered borrowing costs. The final result is more available funds for social services such as universal healthcare and free tertiary education. The subsidy for senior high school students continues. The pandemic is on a global scale and so is the economic downturn. We have always had a problem with foreign direct investments because of policy, infrastructure, labor and power issues. Infrastructure and policy are being addressed by Build-Build-Build (BBB) and amendments to the Public Services and Retail Trade Liberalization Act. We actually need to amend the Constitution.
The vital reform issue which we refuse to address is the bureaucracy. The Ease of Doing Business Act and the creation of the Anti-Red Tape Authority hasn’t had much impact on reforming the bureaucracy. The delay in the release of salaries and allowances of government employees is due to the bureaucracy. The local government unit (LGU) heads at their level haven’t done much either. Given the pandemic is endemic, now is the perfect time for bureaucratic reform because it is necessary moving forward. We should also do away with the bicameral legislature set-up. It is a waste of money and is both inefficient and unproductive. As Bobi Tiglao describes it, we cannot be at the mercy of 24 megalomaniacs. A unicameral parliamentary system is better-suited for legislative work. It will be more in-tune with the Executive and produce better results in terms of continuity and consistency.
Our political immaturity is being condoned by the Opposition with their antics. This is due to their being lazy and intellectually dishonest. They prefer the shortcut method instead of actually working to present an alternative platform of government. In their case, it is only about “good” versus “evil”, with them having the monopoly over the former. This is why they have little credibility left with the public and their mouthpieces like Chanco, blame the public instead of themselves, for the shift.
The focus now should be on the pandemic and economic recovery but we are stuck with politicking again because it is an election year. The public should force the politicians to shift to an issues-based discussion of the problems we face and not the usual mudslinging. The time of motherhood statements is over. What we need now are concrete plans of action moving forward. Chanco makes it about political ideology when it is not because there is no ideology in Philippine politics. It has been, and continues to be, all about power.",Politics

But before she gets to even the shallow criteria she applies to her argument, she plays the Woman Card writing how women “are getting to be more and more the attractive choice as we approach the elections next year”. Not having yet grasped the fallacy in her dishonest claim to a cause-and-effect relationship between a leader’s gender and a nation’s coping with the pandemic, she now “suggests that 1) women don’t become dictators (one among 70); and 2) the only exception was, compared to male dictatorships (think only of Marcos), a rather short, almost benevolent one.”
After devoting almost the first half of her column to that messed up logic, Mareng Winnie then crows…
So that’s another argument for women-led governments.
And then, Monsod gets to the main brainwave of her piece; that “Leni will come into the presidency with clean hands and a clean heart. No political baggage: She is a widow, her children have no political ambitions, so the corruption potential is minimized.” All things being equal, Inday Sara “Daughterte” and Leni Robredo being women (thus making a piece and a half of her recent work irrelevant), Monsod just has to squeeze in this pained appeal to you, “Reader”.
Wow.
If you were to pick, who will you choose? Sara has been leading all surveys since last year. Robredo hasn’t even broken double-digits despite her being in the news cycle 24/7 for the past five years. The “defeated” Vice-Presidential candidate Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, as BBM is described by media loyal to the opposition, scores higher than her. It’s a fact they don’t mention because how can a “defeated” candidate score higher than his opponent who “won” the race?
Between the two, I would rather vote for Sara, not because she is the daughter but based on what I see are her pluses. She does not have any of the  liberal credentials that Monsod enumerated but she has proven herself capable of being her own person outside of her father’s shadow. She has a strong character and is very articulate in her statements as opposed to Robredo who always sounds like a ditzy colegiala.
Imagine how Daughterte is leading the Presidential race when she hardly has been visible since her father became President. She has largely kept to the confines of her Davao comfort zone. You don’t see her traveling with a media entourage unlike Robredo who always has a cameraman in tow. The only time Sara had extended visibility was during the 2019 election campaign. She lay low again right after.
Robredo has, in fact, shrinked away from any more encounters with Daughterte after she was given a dose of the infamous Duterte sarcasm when the VP made a comment about the high number of Covid cases in Davao City. The verbal shellacking Robredo got effectively put a sock in her mouth and she has not gone after Sara after that incident.
Both actually don’t have the experience when it comes to the other key aspects of being President such as foreign affairs and the economy. Despite Leni being an Economics graduate of UP, she hasn’t made any sensible statements about what she plans to do for economic recovery should she become President. Yesterday, she was again hoping to become the pandemic czar with blanket authority. For whatever it’s worth, Robredo is better off having a blanket over her head.
In a one-on-one race, Daughterte will easily beat Robredo, even with one hand tied behind her back. If this were a horse race, Duterte is the thoroughbred. Robredo is the mare with weak bloodlines.",Politics
Hard habit to break: The Philippine Opposition’s FAILED five-year effort to paint Duterte as a “tyrant”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/hard-habit-to-break-the-philippine-oppositions-failed-five-year-effort-to-paint-duterte-as-a-tyrant/,"The other day, we heard the incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo make a statement about her being tempted to ask for blanket authority to be the head the government’s pandemic response. Just when you think that was too funny, here comes Randy David trying to top the VP’s idiotic rant in his Inquirer piece today “The making of a tyrant”. There, he makes the usual fantastic but overused shrill assertion…
Over the last five years, Mr. Duterte has never hesitated to bare the naked force behind the veneer of presidential power. He has shown no qualms in deploying the official mechanisms of the state to avenge a deeply personal grudge, or to repay a private debt. He finds absolutely nothing wrong in this, for he himself acknowledges that that’s exactly what he’s doing. Many of his admirers applaud this candor as yet another manifestation of his authenticity.
David was the cone who coined the label Dutertismo to refer to the President’s politics. It hasn’t really taken off even within the Opposition ranks. Only he and Richard Heydarian ever use the label. It generally means Duterte’s brand of “populism” in their book. The question the two academics have never addressed is why is this “tyrant” popular when the opposite is normally true with tyrants?
In the case of former President Ferdinand Marcos, what had Filipinos turning against him was corruption, the ostentatious lifestyle of his wife Imelda, and the “assassination” of Ninoy Aquino in 1983. It divided the country into two camps but the effect thirty years hence has been the revival of the Marcos political fortunes. Marcos’s son former Senator Bongbong Marcos is a viable candidate for any national post he runs for. The same is true with his sister Imee.
The Opposition still does not acknowledge its failures. It still uses the same tired strategy it had used against its political enemies in the past thirty years. Witness how Joseph “Erap” Estrada was discredited through “corruption” and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) subject to the same with the usual military rebellion thrown in. Even if the means are illegal, the “good” versus “evil” narrative applies which is enough justification for the Opposition. God is on their side, they claim. This is why the Catholic Church has largely lost its clout in society. The Catholic vote has evaporated. It is the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) that remains dominant in the religious aspect which is why politicians still court their head for votes in every election cycle, even if they are Catholic or have their own religious organization like the Villanuevas of Jesus is Lord.
The latest political stage show began two weeks ago and has no end in sight until probably the end of the year. It’s like a Broadway run that is dependent on public mileage for its longevity. The President doesn’t take anything sitting down which is where David gets his bases for accusing him of being a tyrant and using his office as a “bully pulpit’. How dare David when Duterte’s predecessor, former President Noynoy Aquino, was more politically vindictive as in the case of his vendetta against then Supreme Court Justice Renato Corona and his political enemies who were persecuted by then Secretary of Justice Leila De Lima.
The President is aware of the show being staged by today’s Senators which is why it is now down to mudslinging. In the midst of the pandemic, it would be more productive if the Senators focused on budget realignments, an activity more attuned to their job description. Let the Commission on Audit (COA) finalize their findings first. But this won’t happen because of a pressing need to exploit every opportunity to sabotage the incumbent administration which is also why David comes out with another stupid piece where he accuses the President of overreach, hence the “tyrant” label.
The truth is, this is why Duterte continues to be popular. He has his finger on the public pulse. If he were to give in to his personal sentiments then we would probably see him go after his political enemies. But even in that aspect, Duterte is a maverick. He lets his political enemies make fools of themselves on the national stage. This is why he confidently challenges the public “talunin niyo mga Senador na yan,” meaning “don’t vote for these Senators in whatever office they run for”. What it comes down to is a high-stakes game of political poker. It’s a gamble on both parties because the President has to contend with an independent-minded daughter and squabbling within his political coalition. The same is true with the Opposition which is also politically-divided. Indeed, this late in the election cycle, only one tandem has been finalized and they will have their formal launch on September 8.
The public has had enough of the political noise. With the Delta-induced surge raging, their priorities are jobs, education for their children and public health in terms of surviving this pandemic. If the opposition isn’t careful, they might be in for a rude awakening come May 2022. Duterte may be a tyrant from the point of view of the Opposition and its hacks but to the public he is THEIR tyrant, the one who protects their interests.",Politics
Manila Times columnist and DLSU professor Antonio Contreras’s intellectually-dishonest apology for being a former Duterte supporter,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/manila-times-columnist-and-dlsu-professor-antonio-contrerass-intellectually-dishonest-apology-for-being-a-former-duterte-supporter/,"The Chief Political Analyst’s mea culpa is on exhibit on the Manila Times today in Antonio Contreras’s column “Painful cleansing of a political sin”. Contreras writes of the catharsis he experienced watching Mae Paner’s film Tao Po which dramatised the “plight” of the casualties of President Duterte’s “war on drugs”. The film “brutally engaged” him, Contreras writes reflecting on how he once “nitpicked that since we do not have judicial killings as we have outlawed the death penalty, every killing is an extrajudicial killing, in a blatant attempt to delegitimize the seriousness of the allegations against Duterte.”
Academics like Tonton Contreras are such wonders to behold. Despite their educational background, they suffer the most from crises; existential, moral and whatever else is out there. This seems to be caused by fickle-mindedness. He can’t seem to decide up to now, what his principles in life are. Women are naturally fickle-minded. Men are generally not. But not all men are from Mars. Some are from Venus as well…
I am now a person so hated by the diehard Duterte supporters (DDS), even as my friends and colleagues who abandoned me when I was still dining and posing in photographs with the DDS have never fully taken me back. This is just fine, because now I know who my real friends are, and I am now in a much better place – in the political middle, an equal opportunity critic, not blinded by Duterte or Marcos worship, but will not also take hook, line and sinker a Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo.
My short stint in academe has exposed me to a level of fakery I never thought existed among members of this social group. In my time, teachers were respected. They were looked up to because we believed that they were the most knowledgeable since they were teaching us. Woe to those who didn’t make the cut for they were ridiculed. Discipline was the order of the day. This is how we grew up to be the men of today. Granted not all men are created equal but the core characteristics should be there. As one matures, one encounters the harsh realities of life. Exposure is the key. A privileged existence is not available to every Filipino. I learned this at a very early age but it still didn’t prepare me for the poverty I saw in the provinces when I had the opportunity to travel outside of Metro Manila. It is easy to embrace the leftist-militant ideology if you are idealistic at this age. I was. But I didn’t think the answers lay in communism or socialism. I was already a keen student of history then. There is no such thing as a utopia. There will always be cracks in society and those who fall into it, often do by choice. What use is the gift of discernment if we don’t use it?
Contreras is a man who is well-aware of the choices he has made in his life. When he shot to popularity, my first impression of him was good but not good enough even if he was teaching at my college alma mater. Definitely the standards of those who came before him were higher. It didn’t come as a surprise when he became a columnist for the Manila Times. A political analyst should have experience in the conduct of politics and campaigns. It is a science because it involves the study of the political behavior of people. What makes them vote for candidates, what issues are they concerned about, what is going on in their heads when it comes to politics. Eventually the goal is to find out what drives a group of people to vote for a candidate to make him win an election. It is for this reason that political science is a social science.
Contreras wrote glowingly of Jejomar Binay. We all know Jojobama’s background. The obscure Mabini member who wasn’t front and center among the likes of Joker Arroyo, Rene Saguisag, Bobbit Sanchez and Jun Factoran. Binay rose to prominence as the Officer-in-Charge (OOIC) of Makati City. He was the only OIC who did not remove the employees identified with his predecessor. But he also had the advantage of his predecessor, the late Mayor Nemesio “Mesiong” Yabut dying in office at the height of the plot to oust then President Ferdinand Marcos. It would’ve been a different story if Tata Mesiong hadn’t passed and Binay was appointed to replace him. Contreras was part of a group of columnists who did a demolition job on then candidate Duterte. Not for anything but the whole group of prominent Die-hard Duterte Supporter (DDS) bloggers were on the other side of the political fence during the 2016 election. There are at most five of them who were for Duterte from the beginning. The rest, like Contreras, switched sides after Duterte won.
Contreras can claim good faith all he wants but he is not entitled to the benefit of any doubt because he always had malicious intent from the beginning. He is no different from Gideon Lasco who also had to do a mea culpa the other day on a tweet saying that he “should have opposed Duterte unequivocally in 2016, as I have consistently done so over the past 5 years.” Whatever. Leftist-liberals or liberals per se supporting a candidate who was more a leftist-militant than liberal, who was born at a time when misogyny was the rule rather than the exception in a society where matriarchs were dominant — go figure that one out. That’s another social science altogether which is anthropology and sociology, which Randy David specializes in.
“Political analysts” are a a dime a dozen nowadays but not all have the natural talent for it. Politics in the Philippines are closely tied in to business and the two go hand-in-hand. This is where Contreras fails because he has never run a political campaign at even the local level. Surveys don’t make much sense until the seasoned political analyst translates the data into the big picture. The truth is Contreras makes an excuse for his critical collaboration with Duterte, something which the President is unaware of as Contreras was mostly dealing with the underlings in the persons of Martin Andanar and Lorraine Badoy. We have balimbings (two-faced characters) for public intellectuals in the same manner we have politicos who are such as well. Contreras just wants to go back into the arms of his bohemian chi-chi leftist-liberal friends such as Inday Espina Varona, Mae Paner and others who fancy themselves part of the social intellectual elite of this country. What Contreras will not admit to is he wants his 15 minutes of fame which he believes he was unfairly denied by the administration and the DDS. This is usually the fate of mercenaries and Contreras was the one who made his bed. He should be used to lying on it by now.",Politics
Dick Gordon’s blue ribbon “investigation” into DOH procurement: in “aid of legislation” or in aid of ELECTION CAMPAIGN?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/dick-gordons-blue-ribbon-investigation-into-doh-procurement-in-aid-of-legislation-or-in-aid-of-election-campaign/,"The traditional sins of omission of Senate investigations “in aid of legislation” are on exhibit again this being the an election year. Politics is tough in the Philippines. It’s tough everywhere but it’s tougher here because there is no such thing as a principled stand. It is mostly the business of show as an entertainer once said about showbiz. In his PhilSTAR piece today, Boo Chanco gives space to defend Philippine Red Cross (PRC) CEO and Senator Richard Gordon in his piece “The virus is the enemy”. Gordon had recently been accused by President Rodrigo Duterte of using the PRC as a “milking cow” to fund his political ambitions. This comes as Gordon heads the Senate blue ribbon committee “investigating” the deals of the Department of Health (DOH) related to the purchase of pandemic response facilities.
If, indeed, it was proven that some people made money at the expense of the taxpayers at a time of pandemic, we have enough laws to deal with that.
It is horrible to hear Duterte calling Gordon fat and throwing out innuendoes that damage the reputation of the local Red Cross as an institution.
Gordon merely heads the Red Cross and it cannot be denied that under his watch, the institution has expanded its activities to quickly respond to the needs of our disaster-prone country.
Dick Gordon is probably the only Ateneo alumnus who wanted the Presidency so bad but couldn’t make it. Noynoy Aquino beat him to it in 2010 and all he had to show was his provenance. We all have our biases so we cheer when Gordon roasts a Yellowidiot like in the Dengvaxia hearings and then hate him with a compunction when he turns and trains his guns on the administration. The difference lies in the proof or the evidence presented. In the Dengvaxia fiasco, the dots were all connected. The same with the Janet Lim Napoles “Disbursement Allocation Program” (DAP) scam and the bribery of Senators during the impeachment trial of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona. Of course the disentes didn’t raise a howl because that would be an admission of guilt. But as we came to know about them more, we found that their hypocrisy showed no bounds. They will bend and break the Constitution to suit their needs. All in the name of “good” versus “evil”. The ends always justify the means in their book. It helps also that the propaganda arm comes out swinging with accusations and “analysis.” The Opposition has Rappler for that. Even if there is no factual basis, their “reporting” is de facto “truth” in their minds. Maria Ressa shouldn’t wonder anymore why she’s been hit with libel cases. It really is libel within the definition provided in the Revised Penal Code.
Thing here is the Senators grandstand at our expense. It’s our centavo they’re fucking around with every time they go fishing in aid of reelection or in aid election to higher office. The Commission on Audit (COA) hasn’t released a notice of disallowance for their findings with reference to the DOH audit. Why? Because they still have time to address the issues. That’s the process. It has to be followed because it is in the Audit Manual. Healthcare workers are up in arms over their delayed special risk allowance. Part of the blame is on the COA too. I’m a government consultant at present and I haven’t been paid my professional fees for three months since I started and my engagement is only for six months. Even if I complain, the bureaucracy does not move. Come September 15, it will be four months that I haven’t been paid. It makes me wonder if our Senators are so stupid that they have no idea of how the system works. But that can’t be since they’ve been in government for the longest time. It leads one to ask the question, what’s all the fuss about?
In light of the pandemic, no one has clue about how to go about the campaign for 2022. No mass gatherings unless you can guarantee testing and proof of vaccination. So candidates have this huge headache because there won’t be much of the actual interaction with voters that happens in campaign rallies and sorties. A motorcade is the only option left unless the candidate is willing to learn to ride a motorcycle and do a tour of key cities in the country. The President has apologized to the public for his shortcomings on pandemic response yesterday. He has taken it upon himself to accept responsibility because he is the President. But he did get his licks in against the Senators. We will find out what office Gordon is aiming for by October 8 but he will most likely run for reelection to the Senate but not on the administration ticket that’s for sure.
What we should focus on is how to abolish the Senate and shift to a unicameral parliamentary system instead. The Senate is a waste of money. It makes more sense to have a parliament where the actual government is formed from its ranks. This was the original structure adopted by the Malolos Congress. It was only the Americans who rammed down this stupid bicameral legislature down our throats. It was reestablished in the 1987 Constitution as a control mechanism for the oligarchs and the political elite. The pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses in our political and economic sectors. These need to be addressed to deliver a more effective response to the disruptive nature of the pandemic. We can’t borrow our way to economic recovery. We need foreign capital to jumpstart the economy. Yet the legislature continues to sit on key legislation put forth by the Cabinet’s economic cluster. Under a parliamentary system, the Cabinet ministers are also members of parliament and they can introduce legislation that is more attuned to what the country needs. Under the present system, we’re at the mercy of roughly how many legislators, half of whom, at least, don’t know what their jobs actually are. This is why the 2022 election is crucial for our future and survival. We should elect candidates who present actual platforms with plans of action and not just the old motherhood statements.
The case is being made for Leni Robredo as the best option for 2022. If she’s the best then we’re doomed. She can’t even make a decision on whether she is running or not which highlights her lack of principle. It shows that she does not have the courage to stand by her convictions and make a stand during this crucial period in our history. There is a disconnect between her statements and her actions because she has said that the Philippines cannot afford another six years of a Duterte at the helm and, yet, she can’t make a categorical statement if she is running or not. This is not how a natural-born leader behaves. Yesterday, Erin Tañada tweeted his tweak of the Beatles classic, Let It Be, turning it into “Let Leni Be”. This does not suit Robredo. She is more of The Great Pretender.
If the Opposition can’t come up with an alternative platform and all they can do is put on a show at the Senate then they don’t deserve our vote. We should consider other options but it won’t really amount to much given the shallow talent pool. Even if Leni, Isko and Pac-Man ran together, their collective abilities still won’t amount to the point that it would make a difference.",Politics
5 years of Leni Robredo’s little PR stunts don’t add up to REAL achievements that befit a NATIONAL leader,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/5-years-of-leni-robredos-little-pr-stunts-dont-add-up-to-real-achievements-that-befit-a-national-leader/,"Leadership has a pro-forma definition but for one to be called a leader, in the true sense of the word, one has to prove himself or herself first. Former President Cory Aquino was a leader. Look at her record during her tenure. Could that be described as effective leadership? Fidel Ramos followed suit. His much-bruited about attention to detail by his “Completed Staff Work” (CSW) requirement for all paperwork forwarded to his office is legendary. But what did he actually achieve? Joseph “Erap” Estrada didn’t have a chance from the beginning but his Cabinet was probably the best overall post-Marcos. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) achieved the impossible. She was able to bring out the best from the motley group she assembled after the resignation of the Hyatt 10; the Yellowidiots she had to accommodate because of her deal with Cory. GMA was and still is a leader. That’s why she is the most unpopular President. PNoy? Noynoy Aquino was a Boy-King made President. That’s all he was.
President Rodrigo Duterte has shown what he’s made of. Far from perfect but he has delivered on each of his promises except for federalism, which is what is needed now to finish off what he set out to do. Of the current crop of candidates being bandied about, Ping Lacson stands out. His expertise in the budget, experience in legislation and his knowledge of the inner workings of government while in its service qualifies him to run for the highest post again. For Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) to suggest that Vice President Leni Robredo should step up to the plate in his piece “The widow might” is absurd. All he has to present by way of “achievements” Robredo has delivered to exhibit Quezon’s standard of “leadership” are initiatives that don’t befit the scale at which a national leader would be expected to work towards. Instead, they come across as mere PR stunts that compete with executives at local government levels and even non-government organisations (NGOs) for media mileage.
Do you still remember how the Vice President helped organize these volunteers? Or how the effort led her to release, for public use by anyone who’d care to use it, a template for people to follow, to make useful PPE? That was on March 29, 2020. On YouTube, you can still see the video of her visiting sewers in Bulacan on Aug. 5, 2020. This was the second wave of such efforts, mind you, at a cost of P378.37 per set. Do you remember her response, when the government, in imposing a lockdown, decreed a halt to all public transport? Free shuttle services complete with schedules were organized. And there were COVID-19 kits for citizens, the Swab Cab initiative, the Vaccine Express initiative, the free dorm effort when our frontliners were being ostracized and even evicted from their dorms, the Community Mart for consumers, and many more.
Robredo is a lawyer while Lacson is not but there is more sense from the Senator than the Vice-President when it comes to the issues of the day. Leni thrives in NGO-speak while Lacson is concise about what needs to be done. Robredo specializes in brokering donations from the private sector for the public; the laylayan that she claims to care for and serve. Quezon invented the phrase “the little office that could” to describe and refer to the Office of the Vice-President (OVP). Think again. The Php900 million annual budget of the OVP, is not little. To put that in perspective, a local city university with 8,000 students has an annual budget of P300M. If the office is that “little”, where does the bulk of the monies go? PS? MOOE? Capital Outlay? None of the programs the OVP has come up has been adopted by any government agency, department or LGU. None of it has been institutionalized because it’s not scalable. It is mostly for the VP’s PR machine.
Lastly, the VP hasn’t been able to keep any appointive position in government for at least six months. The main reason is she is not a team player. She acts as if she is not part of the Executive branch. As a lawyer, she should know better. As an economist, she also has no contribution at all. As a leader she has failed as the titular head of the Liberal Party as evidenced by their debacle in the 2019 election. Where is her political base at the national level if she really won over Marcos in 2016? Shouldn’t that be command votes in her favor? Robredo isn’t a leader. All the signs and evidence point to her being a fraud. She is a fraud. Plain and simple.",Politics
Continued failure of Philippine Opposition to gain public approval rooted in the hypocrisy of its top “thought leaders”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/continued-failure-of-philippine-opposition-to-gain-public-approval-rooted-in-the-hypocrisy-of-its-top-thought-leaders/,"President Rodrigo Duterte’s niece Nuelle Duterte has, for several years now, been used as an Opposition poster girl by the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media organisations because she reportedly tells people she meets in New York (where she works as a “psychiatrist”) that her famous uncle “kills people”. In a recent Facebook post, Nuelle explores the idea that Filipinos are victims of “operant conditioning” which she describes as “a process of changing behavior by rewarding or punishing a subject each time an action is performed until the subject associates the action with pleasure or distress.” She then goes on to assert…
The [Philippines] is being conditioned to accept that corruption is normal, extrajudicial killing is justified, and criticism is akin to rebellion.
There’s something terribly wrong when people are so easily conditioned. That some even choose it over freedom of thought.
I’m of the impression that Nuelle grew up in Davao before she migrated to the US. I’m not privy to her age but I would assume she was still a child in the late 80s to early 90s when Davao City was akin to no man’s land after sunset. It is easy to say that Filipinos are being “conditioned” by Duterte. But this Duterte hasn’t experienced how Davao City was at its worst. She also wasn’t a resident of the National Capital Region (NCR) during the Aquino administration. Extra-judicial killings (EJKs) did not stop after the ascent of Cory to the Presidency. This was the policy because Fidel Ramos was Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief at the time and, subsequently, Defense Secretary. It is no secret that Ramos followed the dictates of the US when it came to counter-insurgency. He was also the head of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and the Integrated National Police (INP) thereafter under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. The Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs) became Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (CAFGUs) under his watch — paramilitary personnel in every barangay as part of the counter-insurgency strategy.
The other Duterte must also be aware of narco-states of which Mexico is the leading example. Cartel violence has seen civilians in the crossfire. In Colombia, at the height of Pablo Escobar’s power, he held an entire country hostage through his vast wealth through murders of government officials and bombings that killed civilians. He even planted a bomb on an airliner. That Nuelle Duterte has become an Opposition icon because of her surname is typical. What makes it offensive is she isn’t even a Filipino citizen. She is not nuanced in what’s happening in the country in the same manner that other Fil-Ams are. Look at Ruben Carranza, a former PCGG commissioner, who turns out to have held US citizenship at the time he was appointed to a government position.
As @benign0 postulates, our problem as a country is not only political but also socio-cultural. We have “journalist-activists” against the administration but in the payroll of the oligarchs. They are a power bloc unto themselves, they would like to think. This is why they have lost credibility. They are mercenaries. The goal of every impoverished Pinoy is to cross over to the other side of the social divide from have-not to have. We have this photo of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao eating with his hands while, on the side of his plate, one could spy gold-plated or even real gold cutlery. His initials “MP” stands for Mamamayan at Panginoon we are told. He believes or his handlers are making him believe, that this is his pathway to the Presidency. Our politicians pander to the poor in every election cycle because they comprise the most number of voters. The poor are agog at the attention paid them for this short span of time. They are used to the routine of their votes being bought during campaign seasons. Any well-meaning politician will start off as an idealist but will eventually be consumed by the system.
This is why I am amazed at the effrontery of leftist-militant bohemians such as the cabal of Inday Espina Varona. She praises Erik Matti’s latest cinematic masterpiece On the Job: The Missing 8 but doesn’t see herself in the role that John Arcilla plays as the mouthpiece of political kingpin Manong Pedring Eusebio played by Dante Rivero. We have seen journalists being the grantees of edifying scholarships such as the UK’s Chevening and Canada’s McLuhan but they’re none the better once they are back home to continue in the practice of being paid hacks. This practice shows no signs of abatement as even the millennials are following in the footsteps of their seniors. Just look at the Rapplerettes of Maria Ressa. They are the future of Philippine journalism. Scary, right?
While the Aquinos Ninoy, Cory, and Noynoy are resting in peace, Marcos continues to be the bogeyman for the Opposition. Marcos’s flogging is worse than what Mussolini or Qaddafi ever got. Marcos’s memory lives on today because the Opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other Duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of Filipinos. They are no better than the frailes who wanted Filipinos to remain ignorant so they can be manipulated at will. This is what ABS-CBN achieved “in the service of the Filipino people worldwide.” I have gone from an idealist in my youth to a pragmatist as a yuppie as we were then called. The fact is there is no single politician in the country who can claim to be as clean as what the opposition claims the members of their ranks are. This has been the case since time immemorial.
The Yellowidiots have never made good on the promises they made while in the process of ousting Marcos in 1986 and they can’t claim the success for it either because credit to that belongs to Juan Ponce Enrile, Gringo Honasan and the US. I’m no Duterte apologist but I can see what he has been able to achieve in his five years in office despite his having to contend with the shrill Opposition. That is a separate achievement in itself. Think of what he could’ve been done if the Opposition cooperated with him for the sake of nation-building. What we have actually seen is the conditioning being done by the opposition on the Filipino people since 1986.
The infrastructure Marcos built bears mute testimony to his achievements. This is also true in the case of the “defeated” Vice-Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who continues to rank higher than the “winning” Vice-Presidential candidate Leni Robredo in surveys for the 2022 election. Contrast this with the Opposition whose members, after thirty years in power, can only boast of naming whatever in honor of Ninoy Aquino and the monuments to him throughout the country — an unofficial “hero” whose fifteen minutes of fame was had at the tarmac of the airport now named after him.

Red Alert! Yellowtards and communists up in arms over Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/red-alert-yellowtards-and-communists-up-in-arms-over-toni-gonzagas-bongbong-marcos-interview/,"Today, the Yellowtards and communists are having a cow over the latest outrage fad being spun around Toni Gonzaga’s interview of former Senator Bongbong Marcos on her YouTube show ToniTalks.
Why is wokedom all hopping mad about this? It is because they are offended by the notion that a popular celebrity whose YouTube channel Toni Gonzaga Studio boasts more than four million subscribers is “giving a platform” to the “dictator’s son”. “Activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago went on a tililing rampage on Twitter to explain to us “why this is a problem”.
To people like Stuart-Santiago, it is unfair of Gonzaga to be featuring Marcos on her show even if she’s had Yellowtard politicians like Vice President Leni Robredo in the past. That’s because, according to Stuart Santiago, the “Marcoses and Villars are already spending money (on the back of the people) for propaganda. Lamang na sila to begin with. Walang fairness dito.” It seems to escape her that the Opposition enjoy the backing of ABS-CBN and the Inquirer the country’s biggest media conglomerate and its most widely-circulated newspaper respectively. If that isn’t an unfair advantage long enjoyed by the Opposition, what is?
Evidently, the Opposition are all sore over their continued failure to put out a leader possessing enough charisma and gravitas to attract the favours of the Filipino public. Robredo, the personality perceived to be (or what tradition dictates to be) their “leader”, consistently languishes at distant fourth or fifth places in various surveys conducted by reputable polling firms over the last several years. Clearly, the Opposition are unable to put forth a better proposition that resonates with Filipinos.
How much simpler can one put it? To engage Filipino voters, you have to show how you can do things better. Today’s Opposition still don’t get it, however. To them, winning an election is all about convincing Filipinos that the incumbent or bogeyman of choice sucks. They do this by creating and latching on to one or another outrage fad every week — be it a video leaked of the Presidential Spokesperson “berating” a bunch of doctors, an audit finding midway through a standard reporting cycle, or rich people doing what rich people do and making it all about how the current administration does not give out enough ayuda. This week it is Gonzaga’s Marcos interview.
This sort of trial-and-error negative campaign approach insults the intelligence of Filipino voters and, as such, it is no wonder that the Opposition are so far failing to gain any traction with the public. They remain fixated on blatant attempts to distract voters from the fact that the Opposition don’t have anything to work with — no charismatic statesmanship, no leader, no platform — in short, no value proposition. The Opposition — and I mean just about every party across the non-admin board and the personalities they put forth — are an empty shell of form within which rings not much more than hollow rhetoric. How much more can be squeezed from obsolete signalling of one’s “care for the poor”, outrage over “corruption”, and grandstanding of inconsequential ambag initiatives that lack scale? But this is exactly the sort of thing we see being spewed by Opposition “thought leaders” that is amplified by their cronies in Big Corporate Media.
Surely Filipinos deserve something a bit more than rhetoric that paints them as perpetual victims. There are lots of Filipinos who would like to see options that describe what the Philippines could be and, perhaps an even greater number who are sick of being told what a leader should not be. The Opposition can shout out “Never Again!” ’til the cows come home. But until the Yellowtards and communists learn to show Filipinos what can be rather than what should “never” be “again”, they will continue to suffer catastrophic election losses. To the wokedom of today’s Opposition: Learn to be better instead of cancelling people like Toni Gonzaga.",Politics
"The emerging Marcos-Duterte, Lacson-Sotto, and Domagoso-Poe race for 2022",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/the-emerging-marcos-duterte-lacson-sotto-and-domagoso-poe-race-for-2022/,"Here goes former Undersecretary and Inquirer columnist Manuel L. Quezon III (MLQ3) again with his Duterte doomsday scenarios. In his piece “Winter is coming” today, MLQ3 writes of his obsession with speculation around  “how close, exactly, the President and the Marcoses are”. Deep inside he would like nothing better than for President Rodrigo Duterte to experience what his predecessor Noynoy Aquino did in 2016. Noynoy was dumb enough to think Mar Roxas could win or thought he had no choice but to give Mar his due since he made the ultimate political sacrifice in 2010. But if Cory Aquino hadn’t died in 2010, Joseph “Erap” Estrada would’ve made a comeback and that was what the Yellowidiots were most afraid of. They would be at his mercy because they had broken ties with former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA).
In 2016, you couldn’t say who would win the Presidency. There was no candidate that generated buzz among the public. Grace Poe was supposed to be it but the public became cold after her citizenship issues were exposed. Then Vice President Jejomar Binay was the veteran with the experience and the track record but he had been tarred and feathered with corruption thanks to Koko Pimentel, Antonio Trillanes and Alan Peter Cayetano. If Duterte hadn’t run, no way was Roxas going to be denied the Presidency, by hook or by crook. Once Duterte connected with the voters, the race was over by March.
What MLQ3 is saying now is the administration won’t be able to put up a common candidate for President. Reports have it that National Unity Party (NUP) Chairman Ronnie Puno is onboard as the campaign manager of the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem. NUP earlier committed to a renewal of its alliance with Hugpong ng Pagbabago but with Inday Sara Duterte’s official statement that she’s not running, the NUP is now going with Reporma, the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), and Lacson-Sotto. This leaves the administration with Lakas and Nacionalista as its coalition partners, assuming the PDP-Laban brouhaha is decided in favor of the Al Cusi wing, to make up the administration’s 2022 slate. The addition of Ronnie Puno just made Lacson-Sotto a formidable challenger to the administration. Puno brings with him the NUP network and his as a former Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary. It’s not to be forgotten also that he was the architect of Fidel V. Ramos’s (FVR’s) victory in 1992. In this scenario, the President and GMA are left with no other choice than to run a Marcos-Duterte ticket. It is not only logical but it is also the best test of public approval for the Duterte administration if the election is to be about continuity or change.
What MLQ3 does not mention is how his Leni Robredo is still out in the cold. Robredo is now being packaged as the “symbol of the opposition,” whatever that means, who is trying to unify various groups against the administration. Really now? Leni being the honest broker between Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao and Isko Moreno Domagoso? Is this why Pac-Man was photographed having breakfast at Balay Puti eating with his hands despite the gold cubiertos at the side of his plate? Everything is conjecture at this point with the only ominous sign being Puno’s becoming campaign manager for Lacson-Sotto. Inday Sara “Daughterte” can still change her mind. So can Duterte. It remains to be seen if Isko will make good his declaration see you in October but I don’t think he’s backing out of the race unless Lito Banayo can’t work his magic building a coalition for Isko. The rumored defection of a Visayas group has the name of Drilon written all over it. Maybe Banayo is thinking given the demographic profile, it wouldn’t be a danger to coalesce with the Liberal Party, that it might actually work to their advantage. This still leaves the question of who Isko’s running mate is. Robredo won’t make a good one. There is Grace Poe.
A Marcos-Duterte, Lacson-Sotto and Domagoso-Poe contest would be the most logical but politics isn’t all about logic. It is about addition. It is about permanent interests not permanent enemies. Going into October, Lacson-Sotto has the advantage over other potential tandems.",Politics
"UP Diliman SLANDERS presidential spox Harry Roque, exhibits Filipino CRAB MENTALITY to the world",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/up-diliman-slanders-presidential-spox-harry-roque-exhibits-filipino-crab-mentality-to-the-world/,"The University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman campus Executive Committee today issued a statement on their position on the nomination of Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque to a seat in the International Law Commission. The statement asserts that Roque’s appointment would “diminish the reputation of the body” because of his professional record “especially during the administration of President Rodrigo R. Duterte in which he serves as a cabinet member.”
This is what happens when institutions become sanctimonious to the point that they lose sight of the realities of the present. It does not speak well of Filipinos in general, and the Philippines in particular, because it shows how divided we are as a nation. In fact, we aren’t fit to be called “one people” at this point in our country’s history. While other countries which have had dictators in their history have moved on, we are still caught in the memory of former President Ferdinand Marcos because the Opposition doesn’t want us to forget. Why? Because they don’t have any more legitimate causes to fight and are too lazy to get down to an issues-based political order.
This is why we’re stuck in a political and economic rut. We are known best for our crab mentality more than anything else. On top of this malaise, there is also the socio-cultural dysfunction of wanting to be always part of the elite, in one way or another. It’s not what you know, but who you know and you fake it until you make it which is the pervasive doctrine in our society. We are all equally guilty of this practice in its mildest and worst forms.
While I’m not a fan of the Presidential Spokesperson, I don’t think it is right to begrudge him of his credentials for an international post to the point that what is supposedly the premiere academic institution in the country resorts to acting in an infantile manner by deliberately sabotaging the effort of one its law alumni through an unflattering description of his work for the current administration. The leftist-liberals of the University of the Philippines have become judge, jury and executioner because their statement is the equivalent of a lynching albeit not in the literal sense of the word.
This holier-than-though attitude is exactly the reason why the Philippines is the laggard in the region. We are our own worst enemy. We always shoot ourselves in the mouth and in the foot. For being the only Roman Catholic country in the region we still do not have a coherent understanding of “let him who is without sin, cast the first stone.” The public should really wisen up to the antics of the opposition. It is they who will bring the country down the proverbial flush toilet.
This is why on May 2022, voters should do away with them first by taking the initiative of flushing them down before they get the opportunity to take the country along with them.",Politics
What SCARES the Yellowtards and communists most about Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/what-scares-the-yellowtards-and-communists-most-about-toni-gonzagas-bongbong-marcos-interview/,"Those who don’t read history, are condemned to repeat it. This is the curse bedeviling the Philippines. Historical revisionism. It wasn’t until Teodoro Agoncillo wrote the History of the Filipino People did we become aware of the betrayals of the leaders of the Philippine Revolution. Emilio Aguinaldo ordering the murder of Andres Bonifacio and Antonio Luna being the most prominent. Next is the sellout to the Spaniards and, later on, the Americans. We do have a warped concept of history because we celebrate Independence Day on June 12 instead of July 4, which is actually incorrect again, because the Americans continued to lord it over their former colony until 1991, which was the only time they actually left.
Our psyche as a people and a country is damaged because we haven’t addressed the root of our dysfunction; we need to come to terms with the reality that we only have a few legitimate heroes and most of them are unrecognized because they were never part of the ruling elite. World War II devastated and destroyed our country. We were caught in the middle of two competing powers in the Asia-Pacific region. History tells us that General Douglas MacArthur’s staff had recommended the Americans take Formosa as the jump-off point to bringing the war to the Japanese. But MacArthur, with his pride and vanity, wanted to fulfill his promise of returning to liberate the Filipinos. And so the country was left reeling after the war because MacArthur was done with the Philippines and his focus was on Japan, which became a de facto American colony. This was why Emperor Hirohito was never made to account for his role during World War II.
The Americans never came up with a Marshall Plan for the Philippines. There was no massive reconstruction effort. It even pared down to the bare minimum the reparations the Japanese had to pay. It still controlled politics and the economy. It wasn’t until Ferdinand Marcos became President twenty years after that the true reconstruction of what was destroyed, began. It was Marcos who had the vision of what the Philippines should be as an independent nation. It was the most prosperous in the region before the war and he wanted that stature back. We could’ve taken the lead but instead, we were left behind by our neighbors once they obtained their independence from their colonial masters.
Today’s “activists” lay all the blame at the feet of Marcos even 56 years after he became President. This week, for example, is marked by the latest outrage fad cooked up by the Opposition involving actress Toni Gonzaga’s interview of Bongbong Marcos on her YouTube channel. The shrill indignation of their thought leaders is articulated by blogger Katrina Stuart-Santiago in her piece “Toni, Bongbong, history and #Halalan2022” where she writes of Gonzaga’s “shameless” work “right on the month of Martial Law commemoration, in utter disregard for the thousands killed, the thousands more who live with its trauma, and the millions plundered by the Marcoses that all of us have suffered for.”
This is about her decision to use her platform for a person who has made a living, has built his wealth, on the back of the Filipino people. This is about using her platform to allow a person to continue to revise history, to change what is true and factual about the Martial Law years and the Marcos dictatorship. This is about her decision to paint a picture of “humanity” out of a dictator, a man under whose leadership the Philippines’ resources and wealth were plundered, under whose tyranny thousands were tortured and killed, under whose cronyism corruption and abuse by oligarchs were condoned.
Think again, Ms Stuart-Santiago — this time beyond the little square that frames the thinking of typical Filipino “activists” such as yourself. Marcos declared martial law not to stay in power but because the Opposition then forced his hand to do so because of the communist insurgency and Muslim secessionists who were organized by Ninoy Aquino against him. Marcos’s original plan to stay in power longer than what was allowed by the 1935 Constitution was to amend it. It is for this reason that he convened the 1971 Constitutional Convention.
The Malolos Congress adopted a parliamentary form of government. Marcos wanted a return to that. The Opposition in control of the legislature had stymied his vision through gridlock which is how Ninoy Aquino made a name for himself when he became a Senator. If Aquino didn’t think of sicced the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) on the government, would Marcos have any reason to declare martial law when he already initiated the process by which the 1935 Constitution could be amended? What would have been the outcome if he wasn’t forced into declaring martial law? He would’ve been able to extend his term definitely. But the country would’ve had a functioning democracy by way of the parliamentary system and there was no way Marcos could’ve prevented the Opposition from running for elective posts.
Marcos learned from experience that the legislature could still pose as a stumbling block which is why he gave the President the power to legislate by executive fiat with a Presidential Decree. Up to today, none of these that he issued have been overturned because they were crafted by the best legal minds he could enlist at that time. The economic performance of the country at that time was hampered by the prevailing geopolitical order. The US economy was suffering from stagflation as result of oil price shocks due to conflict in the Middle East. The US broke the covenant of Bretton-Woods and took the dollar off the gold standard in a bid to revive its economy by establishing the dollar as fiat currency. Developing countries were at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (IMF-WB). The US couldn’t go to war because of the debacle in Vietnam so it resorted to financial hegemony.
One cannot turn a blind eye to the excesses of the Marcos family. But this is what hubris does to any human being. The difference was, despite this hubris, a plan was still in place. Would we be able to host APEC and the ASEAN Summit without the infrastructure Marcos built? Would we have been able to cope with the pandemic without the hospitals Marcos built? Would the national capital region be as congested as it is now if the Metro Manila Development Plan was implemented after Marcos was ousted? Marcos wasn’t all good but he wasn’t all bad either. The question we need to answer is, can we say the same of the post-Marcos administrations when the “good and the righteous” were in power? These “good and righteous” are all agog again because of one interview. Ang OA.
The truth is, we still have corruption in our midst. We still have cronies and oligarchs. We have the large and bumbling bureaucracy. We have free speech and a biased media. We have the culture of mediocrity and asininity cultivated by ABS-CBN. We replaced tehcnocrats in government with unqualified morons. We have entertainers as Senators. This is what we have gained from the “icons of freedom and democracy” that is the Aquino family. We have not been better off since 1986 through 2016. This is why Rodrigo Duterte is President.
What scares the “good and the righteous” the most is the big slap on their collective faces if and when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. becomes President. They are all agitated over one interview because this would be the final confirmation of their failure and the repudiation of the “freedom and democracy” that the Aquino’s have been packaged to represent. This is history passing judgment on Marcos and the Opposition don’t like its verdict.",Politics
Prospects grow dimmer for Leni Robredo as coalition-building amongst alternative opposition bypass her camp,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/prospects-grow-dimmer-for-leni-robredo-as-coalition-building-amongst-alternative-opposition-bypass-her-camp/,"While the public was engrossed with the ongoing feud between President Rodrigo Duterte and Sen. Dick Gordon, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Chair, who is investigating the questionable purchases of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and face masks by the Department of Budget Management (DBM) Procurement Service for the Department of Health (DOH), the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) – Reporma alliance scored a major win with the addition of former Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary and National Unity Party (NUP) Chair Ronnie Puno to be their campaign manager for the 2022 election.
Puno managed the 1992 campaign of then candidate Fidel V. Ramos who scored a major upset over Danding Cojuangco of the NPC, Ramon Mitra of the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) and the surprise voters’ choice Miriam Defensor-Santiago. Puno also managed the campaign of President Joseph Estrada in 1998 and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2004. He was instrumental in the formation of the NUP which broke away from the Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD) in 2011. The NUP earlier declared that it would renew its alliance with the Sara Duterte led Hugpong ng Pagbabago for the 2022 election. However, with the recent statement of the Davao City Mayor that she’s not running for any national post, it would appear now that NUP is supporting the candidacies of Sen. Ping Lacson and Senate President Tito Sotto.
In another material development on the political front, Reporma President Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez met with the Acting President of the Koko Pimentel wing of PDP-Laban, Sen. Manny Pacquiao to talk about a possible alliance for the 2022 polls. Alvarez was the former Secretary-General of PDP-Laban who resigned in September 2020 to join Reporma in his bid to find a suitable Presidential candidate for 2022 to succeed Rodrigo Duterte. That candidate now is Sen. Ping Lacson. The NPC-Reporma’s coalition-building efforts have been paying off handsomely as they have been welcoming new members into the party’s fold. Politics is addition as former Senate President Amang Rodriguez famously said. The addition of the NUP and PDP-Laban to the coalition makes it the most formidable challenger against the administration which is yet to decide on its Presidential bet.
Now that the Presidential daughter has begged off, there are reports that former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr would be the running mate of the President. However, the President has not mentioned or even hinted at such a tandem. It remains to be seen if the President will adopt some Senatorial candidates of NPC-Reporma who he mentioned he would be supporting such as DICT Secretary Gregorio Honasan and Antique Rep. Loren Legarda who are both slated to run under the NPC-Reporma banner as announced by NPC Chair Senate President Tito Sotto.
The prospects are growing dimmer for the opposition led by Vice-President Leni Robredo who also announced that she was in talks with Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and Sen. Manny Pacquiao. Pacquiao has announced that he would consider a Senate or Presidential run or retire from politics altogether. As it is, the PDP-Laban itself hasn’t resolved the internal conflict between the Pimentel and Al Cusi Wings of the party. For the moment, Lacson-Sotto is the tandem that’s gaining ground over its rivals and poses the most serious and credible challenge to the administration in 2022.",Politics
Manny Pacquiao running for President is an outcome of a lazy Opposition and their dishonest propaganda,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/manny-pacquiao-running-for-president-is-an-outcome-of-a-lazy-opposition-and-their-dishonest-propaganda/,"It is the Opposition that has been causing the distraction from Day One of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte and not, as Boo Chanco asserts in his PhilSTAR column “Distracted leadership”, the president. According to Chanco, “Duterte has always been distracted since the start of his term. There has been little decent policymaking on matters other than the economy, but that is thanks to Finance Sec Sonny Dominguez.” This follows a September 10 Fitch Solutions analysis “expressing concern Duterte’s administration will be distracted by politics as we approach our presidential election season. Fitch thinks political distraction is a threat to policymaking in the near term.” Trust the lazy “journalism” of people like Chanco who so uncritically lap up what they google.
Chanco should check his facts. The President made it clear he knew nothing about economic policy. This is why he leaned on Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez to accept the Finance portfolio and head the Cabinet’s economic cluster. You can’t complain about the job he’s done. It’s Congress that’s been sitting on enabling legislation for the economic recovery strategy. Recovery is now the operative word from development, since the pandemic struck. It’s so easy for Chanco to generalize and lump politicians into one category, if they’re not palatable to the Yellows. Ping Lacson being in favor of stricter national security measures is immediately a “Duterte enabler”. But then, isn’t the Anti-Terror Bill timely now that the US has pulled out from Afghanistan? What is wrong with the National ID System given that the new normal is digital? Wouldn’t it facilitate the distribution of social amelioration for the poorest Filipinos and facilitate the public’s transactions with government?
It is this kind of mindset that leaves the Opposition mired in quicksand. Add to this the fact that Vice President Leni Robredo still can’t make up her mind about what post she will run for. How can she “unite” the “anti-administration forces” if she isn’t decisive to begin with? Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao running for President, which he announced yesterday, is not etched in stone. He may still reconsider. At this point, it is hard to believe that Koko Pimentel and Ron Munsayac have him eating out of their hands. His nomination is a farce. It is more of a coronation which is what triggered the split in PDP-Laban to begin with. If Pacquiao is prepared to part with his hard-earned billions, Pimentel, Munsayac and Bernard Peralta will surely have their wallets full by the end of the campaign. No more Birkin bags for Jinkee!
Pac-Man’s acceptance speech yesterday was replete with traditional rhetoric and motherhood statements. Unfortunately, “kalam ng tiyan” is not enough to win the Presidency. He may be popular as a boxer, can muster enough votes to win as Senator, but the Presidency is not an automatic win. Pacquiao will have a hard time during the debates. The Filipino is not stupid to entrust the highest office of the land to someone who doesn’t have the experience and the educational background. They know that if he wins, he will be nothing but a sock puppet for his handlers.
Government and the private sector should really sit down in a summit and thresh out the strategy moving forward. The private sector is stingy about testing. They have no choice if they want their businesses to run. Both will have to agree on a common ground for digitization. It’s time for the Opposition to stop being the prophet of doom and gloom. They don’t even have alternative strategies so how can they claim they can do better than the administration? We should remember what happened after Cory succeeded Marcos. It’s easy for Chanco to blame Duterte but he wasn’t President before he won in 2016.
Since the opposition is as lazy as fuck, their gamble is their propaganda will sell to the youth and millennials who make up 40 million of the estimated 62 million voting population. Thus the current campaign to rile them up. Get them angry. Appeal to their emotions. Hit them with the ol’ “good” versus “evil” narrative. We boomers who are martial law babies have seen this all before. We were the guinea pigs for this experiment and we fell for it during that time. This is why we are telling you now not to fall for it. There will be hell to pay if you do. The opposition doesn’t give a shit about your future. They only care about theirs. Use god’s gift of discernment and freedom to choose wisely. The opposition is actually the devil in disguise. Better the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.",Politics
UP academic Clarita Carlos: convene a team of scholars to SCIENTIFICALLY assess The Marcos Years,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/up-academic-clarita-carlos-convene-a-team-of-scholars-to-scientifically-assess-the-marcos-years/,"This is an excellent proposal by one of the few objective academicians of the University of the Philippines, retired political science professor Clarita Carlos. On a Facebook post, she articulates her idea of convening a team of scholars to mount a “scientific” evaluation of the 21 years that Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines…
Quite troubling that many among us choose only certain segments of the 21 years of Marcos’ administration but  make conclusions for all of the other aspects of his administration…
1.  Note that Marcos ruled the country for 21 years assisted by thousands of us who continue to live to this day;
2.  I, for one, had been a consultant of PM Virata and had been one of the first trainors of the  Career Foreign Service Development Program at DAP, in the early 70s;
3.  If we want a scientific assessment of 21 years of his administration, then, let us compose a team of scholars who will agree on ff:
a.  Methodology for assessment
b.  Relative potencies of variables like agriculture, education, health, foreign policy, etc
c.  Data sources
d.  Data analyses
4.  The results of (3) shall be made public and a series of RTDs to be conducted to give way for any and all challenges to the assessment report.
Trivia:  If some bright minds will again label me as pro Marcos because of my views above, you have two options:
1.  Read my PhD dissertation on FM and RM
2.  Find a deep lake where you can drown yourself
I hope that this initiative flies seeing that even that chi chi educational institution in Katipunan that has become a den of Yellowtardism, the Ateneo, has so far dismally failed to exhibit the same scholarship when it comes to their favourite bogeyman. Indeed, Marcos is not all good but he was not all bad either. Proof? Look at Cory Aquino’s administration! Unfortunately there aren’t many other academics who can be objective in their assessment. Why? It would debunk the narrative which has been spun for Marcos by his detractors. As Winston Churchill said “Study history, study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft.”
The declaration of martial law wasn’t meant to extend Marcos’s term. He already addressed that by amending the Constitution to adopt a parliamentary form of government. With or without martial law, that would’ve been the outcome of the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Martial law was brought about by Ninoy Aquino because he meant to topple Marcos through the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Why? He was obsessed with becoming President and he wouldn’t have the opportunity for as long as Marcos was in office. Ninoy probably thought it was his birthright considering his provenance. Marcos had no provenance to speak of. He only had his brilliant mind. It is for this reason that he was cleared of the murder of Julio Nalundasan even if he was actually complicit. Jose P. Laurel thought it would be a waste of such a man if he was jailed for a crime borne out of political rivalry.
The Yellows and the Reds have been having their cake and eating it too. Why should individuals who have taken up arms against government be regarded as “heroes” as they have been glorified in the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City? Why is Marcos being blamed for the lost youth of the 60s and 70s? Why can’t we move forward from Marcos and martial law? The simplest answer is it’s a convenient excuse for the failures of the Yellows and the Reds so history will not judge them as failures.
It has become evident that they are fuming over the election of Rodrigo Duterte to the Presidency in 2016. This is the will of the people which they refuse to respect as they did with Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 1998. They employed the same with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) after she had a falling out with them. The Yellows and the Reds are going all-out in their vilification of Duterte and Marcos because they realize that it makes perfect sense for both to run and will likely win as a tandem in 2022, this will be the end of them.",Politics
Isko Moreno 2022 presidential bid announcement wakes Robredo from her “United Opposition” wet dream,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/isko-moreno-2022-presidential-bid-announcement-wakes-robredo-from-her-united-opposition-wet-dream/,"Today Isko Moreno Domagoso will make the formal announcement of his candidacy for President with Willy Ong as his running mate. It might as well have been made last night as it was all over social media by late afternoon. Many wondered at the choice of his running mate. For pundits like myself, it meant that Senator Grace Poe kept her word of supporting the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem. She is Isko’s natural running mate. The match made in heaven. Unfortunately for Isko, it didn’t materialize. But why Willy Ong? He made it to the 18th spot in the 2019 election garnering 7.6M votes. He bested some of the Otso-Diretso candidates who had better name-recall. This was mainly due to his social media following. It also goes to show the dearth of viable candidates in the political labor pool.
What it further indicates is the weakness of Aksyon Demokratiko as Isko’s political party of convenience. Lito Banayo has his work cut out for him building a coalition based on Isko’s performance as the campaign progresses. One thing’s for sure, Isko can’t duplicate what then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte did in 2016. For one, he is weak in experience and qualifications. While he may have name-recall, the voting public is looking for leadership at this crucial juncture where uncertainty is the only certainty due to the pandemic. Isko also carries with him excess baggage in closets full of skeletons. These will all come out as  soon as today albeit in instalments. There is also the issue of his not having a political base except Manila. It remains to be seen if Manileños will not shun him for breaking his promise to the Batang Maynila of a better and more improved city in nine years.
What has Isko actually achieved in the capital city during his three years as Mayor? Except for the beautification projects, social amelioration, housing and improved peace and order, not much. It is basically a patchwork quilt of projects designed to make him look good. The local government unit (LGU) bureaucracy is still manual. Corruption is still rampant. He hasn’t gone after the dinosaurs in City Hall because he needs their political support. It is evident in the vaccination drive though Manileños share some of the blame because of their lack of discipline. Still, this is on him because he is the Chief Executive.
What does Isko bring to the Presidency should he be elected on May 2022? Not much again. Isko doesn’t have a think-tank of qualified advisers. His inner circle is composed of Cesar Chavez, Letlet Zarcal and Noel Leyco. Lito Banayo can give him a crash course in the political masterclass he needs but he doesn’t have a labor pool that is worth its weight in qualifications and experience in government service. If he wins, the learning curve is going to be steep. It will be unlike Duterte, who even if he was a Mayor, had enough friends and acquaintances in and out of government whom he tapped to hit the ground running after his inauguration. Isko is widely believed to be relying on the support of anti-Duterte oligarchs; Manny Pangilinan, the Lopez family and the Ayala’s. This group would be able to help in providing him with warm bodies for appointments to key positions which would mean back to the good old days of regulatory capture of government departments or agencies responsible for enforcing policies for the companies of his campaign supporters. The anti-Duterte oligarchs are hoping that Isko can be a better version of Duterte for them because he is more malleable. The bet is he can bring over the masses, the youth and millennials to his side for the win.
It is actually wrong to classify Isko as part of the opposition. He never was. His Mayoral run had the blessing of the President. He managed to get appointments in the interim after his unsuccessful Senate run in 2016. He was part of the strategy to shutout the Estradas in 2019. Duterte can never forget a slight and he never forgave former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada making that statement that he was unfit for the Presidency. This is why Erap wasn’t allowed to graduate in Manila and sons Jinggoy and JV both lost their Senatorial bids. The Estradas were also shutout in San Juan by their rivals the Zamoras who ran under PDP-Laban.
The Opposition is now left with one woman standing alone — Vice President Leni Robredo. The situation now is worse than that of the 2019 election debacle which is also on Robredo. She gravely miscalculated when she shunned the proposal of Sen. Ping Lacson last July. The prep work needed for 2022 should’ve begun right after their loss in 2019 but Robredo didn’t show any initiative. She became the titular head of the opposition in 2016 but she didn’t provide the required leadership, for that matter, nor did Kiko Pangilinan who was just as useless to the Yellowidiots as the President of the Liberal Party. Fact is, even as the “winner” of the 2016 Vice-Presidential race, Robredo still does not have a reliable voter base. That makes her “victory” in 2016 very much suspect, short of saying outright fraudulent.
Robredo has no way to extricate herself from the quagmire she finds herself in now. She is the one left on the 1Sambayan list. This makes her their only choice. The convenors must be banging their heads on the proverbial walls as well given all the rhetoric they spewed during their launch last June 12. As of today, the Opposition has crumbled. You see that when former Undersecretary and yellowidiot “thought leader” Manuel L. Quezon III (MLQ3) tweets about a political conspiracy theory of his own concoction about Ping Lacson withdrawing in favor of Isko making it an Isko-Sotto ticket for NPC-Reporma. Fat chance of that happening. Then you have “activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago still sighing over what might have been if Isko-Poe materialized.
In the end, she throws up her hands and issues an indictment of the dismal quality of the discourse her lot had engaged in over the last several months.
I have a tendency now to disengage completely, because there is nothing productive about the kind of engagement one gets on Twitter or FB when one doesn’t think like the Liberal-VPLeni mob.
The anti-Duterte forces Robredo mentioned in her statement last Monday are, and have been, in a state of chaos and confusion. They are so detached from political realities that they even failed to catch wind of Isko’s and Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao’s impending declaration of their candidacies. Up to Monday, Robredo was still hoping to unify the opposition, even if Isko and Pac-Man weren’t originally a part of it. What is evident now is only the NPC-Reporma ticket poses the most serious challenge to the administration ticket, whoever it might be composed of. The much-anticipated match between the Yellowidiots and the “Die-hard Duterte Supporters” (DDS) camp will not take place because the Opposition has defaulted due to lack of leadership and strategy. This is all on Leni Robredo’s shoulders. The buck of failure stops at the presumptive “leader” of the fantasy of a “united” Opposition.",Politics
The Isko Moreno Show,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/the-isko-moreno-show/,"“Sa mga batang Maynila, sasakabilang ilog lang naman ako. Magkikita pa rin tayo.” With that, Isko Moreno Domagoso declared he will be running in the May 2022 election for President. Excellent production values for a launch. Excellent camera positioning and shot selection complete with a camera drone flying overhead. In his speech, Isko took potshots at the President, criticizing Duterte for everything that he stood for, from the time he was a candidate in 2016, up to the present, with regard to his pandemic response. Isko also focused on his humble origins of course; the batang basurero whom the fates smiled upon and is now a Presidential candidate after only three years in office as Mayor of his city. He claimed his achievements as part of his learning curve and readiness to apply what he’s learned at the local government unit (LGU), on a national level.
Some of his claims need to be corrected. Manila’s city-owned educational institutions aren’t open to non-residents. Internet connectivity is spotty at best. While he has given out tablets to students and laptops to teachers, not all have been able to receive one. There are still many who bring their own devices. As far as the City Hall bureaucracy is concerned, that hasn’t been streamlined yet. As a consultant at Universidad De Manila, I only received my hazard pay for the first enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in December 2020 after the paperwork was submitted in June. On his selection of Dr. Willie Ong as running mate, Isko explained that his Vice-Mayor, Honey Lacuna, has been a great help to him since the pandemic began and so he thought of replicating the same at the national level, seeing as how the pandemic is still raging. He didn’t make mention that Ong’s YouTube following was a factor in his decision-making process.
There was no mention of Aksyon Demokratiko the party. You got the impression that this was The Isko Moreno Show you tuned into on Facebook live. There were general references to what the public can expect from him if he wins the Presidency. These were all the standard Isko motherhood statements. The platform will be made public shortly but he did hint it wouldn’t deviate much from his style of inclusive and open governance  which he adopted in Manila from Day One of his being the local chief executive. Willie Ong didn’t have a prepared speech and only had talking points. The gist of his talk was his mother’s passing compelled him to say yes to Isko after he said no the first time he was asked to be his running mate. He even said no to a spot on the Senatorial slate.
I had the opportunity to interact with Isko several times over the eleven months I was a consultant at UDM and there is no question about his desire to help the poor. The portent of things to come became evident during the press conference after the launch. When asked by Cath Domingo of ABS-CBN about what he learned from his unsuccessful Senatorial run in 2016 and what changes he will make now that he’s running for the highest post in the land, Isko couldn’t answer in specifics but only in general terms; “Nadapa ako nun. Tinisod nga ako sa totoo lang. But we move on and move forward…,” after which he proceeded to give the mic to Willie Ong for him to answer the same question.
The truth is, Isko is a performance politician. Give him a prepared script with a speech and he will do well. But that’s his limit. His ability to answer random questions is severely limited. His glass ceiling is too low. He will easily hit his head on it. I doubt very much if Lito Banayo can prep him for the debates where he will be up against the likes of Sen. Ping Lacson and Sen. Bongbong Marcos. He can beat Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao on a one-on-one but that’s about the limit of his intellectual abilities. It is all form with little substance for Isko. He is raw for national office. If he made it to the Senate in 2016, he would’ve joined the ranks of Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla. His rhetoric against Duterte makes for good sound bites and quote cards but that’s about it. That’s the limit. Even Erap underwent extensive tutoring under Juan Ponce Enrile and Ernie Maceda before he became President.
Isko has landed his biggest role to date. What he failed to achieve in showbiz he did in politics. But if German Moreno were still around, I’m sure he would tell Isko not to run but to prepare first for higher office. As Dolphy was quoted as saying, “madali tumakbo, paano pag nanalo?” At this point in our country’s history, we need veteran leadership with experience. Objectively, other than the administration ticket, provided it doesn’t run Bong Go as President, the worthy challenger is the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem. We will have a four-way race for the two top posts in the administration ticket, Isko-Willie, Pac-Man-TBA and Lacson-Sotto. It will likely come down to a showdown between the administration ticket against Lacson-Sotto. I wouldn’t rule out a desperation move of Willie Ong being dropped in favor of Leni Robredo or a Pac-Man-Robredo tandem since Koko Pimentel has always been Yellow from the beginning. But of today, this is how the Presidential race stands.",Politics
Isko Moreno the political PERFORMER: all image and optics but very little substance,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/isko-moreno-the-political-performer-all-image-and-optics-but-very-little-substance/,"Isko Moreno Domagoso announced his application for President to the public yesterday. In general terms, his claim to the Presidency is based on the three years he was the Mayor of the Capital City of Manila. He touted his achievements, particularly housing, as launch was held in Baseco, where he recently inaugurated the housing project for the informal settlers in that community which have long been eyesores in the city. It’s understandable that Isko’s campaign is tightly-run because Lito Banayo is his campaign manager. It focuses on optics and communications, or “comms”, in political operative slang. If there are performance artists, we also have performance politicians. Isko is the prototype of such. His image and packaging have been engineered since Day One of his stint as Mayor.
Isko’s seeking the Presidency is not a matter of fate, but by design. This is evident in how he became a fixture on social media since his election and how the Manila Public Information Office, headed by the young Julius Leonen, has tapped into the buttons of the youth and millennials, all of which have paid off handsomely for Isko. His choice of running mate is anchored on the thesis that we are in the midst of a public health emergency and nothing is better than having a doctor by your side, as is the case in Manila, with Dr. Honey Lacuna, his Vice-Mayor. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as Isko claims it to be. Isko needs to have a more focused platform than what he spoke about yesterday. For one, the Vice-Presidency is not a post suited for a medical doctor with zero political experience. Willie Ong qualififes as Health Secretary but, as Vice-President, he brings nothing to the table other than his professional expertise. It can be said that our economic and financial health are the most affected by the pandemic. Candidates running for the two top posts should put emphasis on what we need to do moving forward, to recover from both.
Isko’s youth is appealing. He came to the podium yesterday with his iPad in tow and read his speech from there. But the essence in his message was lacking. What he has done in Manila is spend money on social amelioration. He has also received a large amount of donations in cash and in kind from donors, with or without vested interests. What is most striking is the lack of bureaucratic reform in City Hall. It is still the old system in place and digitization of select offices is only for show. In short, other than the optics, his claimed achievements as Mayor are all form without substance. Isko made much of his lack of provenance in a dig at political dynasties. The truth is this can be gained by experience and exposure. Duterte was Mayor of Davao City for 23 years yet he developed contacts in the national government throughout his tenure and the network he had from the schools he attended. Isko doesn’t have the same because he has largely had an insular exposure limited to the City of Manila.
Before he became Mayor, Isko was content in his comfort zone but had his popularity as a movie actor working in his favor when the primary qualification for public office was popularity. The leadership we need for the New Normal is the kind that pushes through a paradigm shift. Isko has nothing much to show in the way of any sort of paradigm shift in Manila, not even in digitization. His campaign manager claims that it’s easy for Isko to grasp concepts and ideas and his mind is like a sponge but Isko has not much to show by way of prototypes as well as he claimed yesterday.
Political leadership is not only about experience and qualifications. It’s also about gravitas. You may be able to connect with voters but you will fail once in office without gravitas. Isko doesn’t have the commanding presence required of a President. The best example would be around the question of how he would govern assuming he wins if Banayo is not able to fill the ranks of Aksyon Demokratiko with veteran politicians. It is highly doubtful that Isko can replicate Duterte’s amazing run in 2016 when he was able to climb up to the top of surveys before the first debate was held. What Banayo is doing now is capturing the public’s imagination with Isko being packaged as an improved version of Duterte, specifically with his background as a scavenger. Again, this may work pre-pandemic but as we are dealing with the disruption caused by one, we need to analyze very carefully because we don’t have the luxury of electing a President who’s not up to the job and the challenges not he, but we also face.
Isko used the emperor with no clothes analogy yesterday when he took a shot at the President. This is why he is a danger unto himself. He doesn’t realize that he is also an emperor with no clothes at this point. He comes wrapped in nice packaging, imaging and script. But the inside is all hollow. It is empty. There is no dull sound that is indicative of substance.",Politics
Isko Moreno Domagoso is not fit to be president,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/isko-moreno-domagoso-is-not-fit-to-be-president/,"The customary puff pieces for Yorme are out. Or is it Yelorme? AksYorme? The political marketing of Isko Domagoso has begun. The Opposition loves picking up sock puppet candidates whom they can mold like clay, into what they perceive to be their ideal. Isko is the latest incarnation. Cory Aquino was a housewife ranged up against the powerful “dictator”. Her son Noynoy was the idiot-savant, Boy-King son who would undo what predecessor Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) did in terms of corrupt practices. Robredo was the kryptonite to the “son of the dictator’.
Now we have the “nangangalakal” tricycle driver who climbed out of poverty through showbiz and self-improvement. Isko is a more polished Duterte. More steeped in development-speak, when provided with a script — the one willing to listen to and do the bidding of whose whose got their hands up his behind. He comes neatly wrapped in a nice package. The image is akin to him being the long-lost brother of Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, who didn’t have the benefit of an education because he was shunned by his stepmother and went on to do good by himself. Now there is a either a rivalry or he acts as mentor to the younger sibling.
The packaging is straight out of a komiks novela from earlier times. Doy Romero in his Inquirer piece “Yorme and the ‘’wag dugyot’ factor” writes, “Isko Moreno is deliberate, resolute, and focused. In time, people will  why Willie Ong was chosen to be his right-hand man. To Yorme, this is a matter not only of providing medical solutions, but more importantly, Isko Moreno is deliberate, resolute, and focused. In time, people will understand why Willie Ong was chosen to be his right-hand man. To Yorme, this is a matter not only of providing medical solutions, but more importantly, communicating as widely and effectively as possible to the people what, and how, collective action needs to be taken over the long haul.”
I doubt very much if Isko understands this. The other day, he couldn’t even answer a simple question about what he’s learned from his loss in 2016 which was his first run for national office. Any other politico would’ve been able to answer a question whose answer comes from what he experienced. On the same day, he gave Rappler time for an extensive interview. His answer to the question about the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the drug war and all the antecedent issues about it leaves viewers with their heads spinning. It’s obvious that he cannot be let out on his own because he’s not ready yet.
Never mind this fact. What’s more important is the anti-Duterte oligarchs have a bet in the Presidential horse race. His handlers assume that the masa will fall in love with Isko and vote him into office the way they did with Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. The basic difference is Isko has good looks but no charisma. Duterte is not good-looking but has charisma. Duterte is not a performance politician either. While not an honor student, it is evident that he’s a wide reader. The same cannot be said of Isko. His platform is going to be made for him as with everything else. What he is, is a mouthpiece, the medium that delivers the message. To put it bluntly, he doesn’t have his own mind. This is why he’s the perfect candidate for the anti-Duterte oligarchs.
A politician of principle would think twice about not honoring a promise he made to his constituents of transforming their lives for the better. The other day Isko was busy justifying his decision to seek higher office. If he wins, he will just be moving from City Hall to Malacañan, he says. He would still be able to help his designated successor, Honey Lacuna. But that’s a big if. His argument about his running mate doesn’t hold too much water either. Willie Ong is a good candidate for Health Secretary but you don’t get a running mate just so you can appoint him to the Cabinet. What does Ong bring to the table aside from his knowledge about health? The justification that we are in a pandemic is obtuse. Ong cannot miraculously end the pandemic. Our inability to contain the virus is largely due to the lack of planning at the national and the local government unit (LGU) level. This is the kind of attention to detail that was practiced last during the Marcos administration.
Isko wasn’t able to transform City Hall during his tenure. The vultures are still there. Institutional reforms are non-existent. The distribution of social amelioration for lockdowns involves the withdrawal of cash from the Landbank and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) branch across City Hall and dividing the cash manually and putting them into envelopes for distribution. The same is true for the stipends he mandated for students of public schools and the two universities under the LGU.
Isko lacks both the educational background and experience. He hasn’t even been around the country yet. As far as peace and order goes, he’s close to the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA). Does he have the gravitas to finally put an end to the communist insurgency in the same manner Duterte was able to bring peace to Mindanao? We need a President who possesses the vision of the paradigm shift. What we need in the new normal is transformation. The pandemic has caused disruption in all aspects of our lives. To address these, we need a leader who is cognizant of the disruption that has taken place and will put into place measures to address the same.
Isko’s glass ceiling is very low. He has already hit it when he made his declaration that he is running the other day. He will break it one of these days and we will see that beyond that, he has nothing more to offer. It is dangerous to elect a President who doesn’t have a mind of his own. With the country at a crucial crossroad, Isko is not fit to be President.",Politics
#LetWomenLead is a dishonest initiative to fund a Leni Robredo candidacy DISGUISED as feminist “activism”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/letwomenlead-is-a-dishonest-initiative-to-fund-a-leni-robredo-candidacy-disguised-as-feminist-activism/,"If we’re to believe Mareng Winnie Monsod, the Opposition’s “Let Women Lead” initiative is off to a good start. P1M+ in donations she points out in her Inquirer piece “LetWomenLead: An idea whose time has come”. This despite no defined grant procedures for who may apply for funding.
It’s easy for Monsod to launch a fundraising initiative because she is also a TV personality. But what of those who are qualified and want to seek public office but are without funds? It will not happen that they will be able to get donations on the same scale as this initiative. At this point we’re suffering from a dearth of candidates because of the prohibitive cost of running for office. It shouldn’t be a surprise that those who win engage in one form of corruption or another in order to recoup expenses. The salary and allowances they are entitled to in office are not enough.
In the US, federal matching funds are given to candidates who qualify. Much has been written about the corruption in political action committees (PACs) which are the solicitation vehicles of candidates. But by and large, the system works. This was how the Squad led by Alexandra Ocasio Cortez won their seats in the House of Representatives. Think of how a federal parliamentary system works better for the country. Regional parliaments and one national composed of member of parliament from the regions who convene to enact national laws attuned to the needs of the regions.
The reason why we fail most of the time is because of the wrong mindset. The 1987 Constitution was just an updated 1935 Constitution. The 1973 Constitution could’ve been amended to remove the powers which then President Ferdinand Marcos gave himself. It could have been modified with the best intent moving forward but because of a rabid desire to erase all vestiges of Marcos in government following that 1986 “revolution”, it was trashed along with everything else.
It’s about time we realize that the problem of bad government isn’t only the fault of “bobotantes“, as the elite refer to the masses, but also elite “thought leaders” like Monsod, who only adopt palliative solutions which still favor their class. This is why we have a socio-political problem which is the root of our political dysfunction. It’s about time that we take a serious look at constitutional amendments and bureaucratic reform seriously. We should ask this question of presidential candidates. Campaign finance is only one aspect. There are several other issues which needs to be addressed if we really want the best of the best to form the core of our government.",Politics
Leni Robredo is the single biggest reason a “united opposition” has FAILED to materialise,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/leni-robredo-is-the-single-biggest-reason-a-united-opposition-has-failed-to-materialise/,"As of today, the Opposition continues to be in a state of flux. Vice-President Leni Robredo finally came out with a statement about the consecutive setbacks her “unification” efforts suffered with the announcement of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao and Isko Moreno that they’d be running for President. The supporters were also dazed and confused. Wasn’t former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio’s coalition 1Sambayan tasked with the purpose of unification? What happened? Etta Rosales said they were split on Robredo and Isko but they would make an announcement on September 30 after survey results were in. Huh?
1Sambayan’s credibility has been put to question because of the non-transparent selection process and the unanswered question of who died and made them god? Meantime, the Vice-President voiced her “heartbreak” about her seeming failure while continuing to justify the delay in her final decision. This, despite the fact that she categorically stated that she would run if only to prevent a Marcos from ascending to the Presidency or six more years of the kind of governance the country “couldn’t take anymore”.
The leader of the Magdalo Group also pressed her for an answer. If she won’t run, then Antonio Trillanes was prepared to take her place because the genuine opposition was what the people need and not the “Duterte-enablers” who have declared. Interestingly, Isko was laying big fat eggs beginning on the day of his announcement continuing throughout the end of the week. Pac-Man wasn’t heard from until the yesterday when he said he was in favor of “unification.” Apparently, he met with the 1Sambayan convenors even while Robredo was busy trying to “unify” the opposition.
So the operative questions became: Who was actually talking to whom at what point? How could they unite if the two others have declared while Robredo was still dilly-dallying in her Quezon City office? In the meantime, her loyalists were busy taking potshots at Isko on social media since he was the latest object of their disaffection with his announcement.
Foe its part, Opposition “social news network” Rappler also made a mess by releasing the latest trust and approval ratings of the President. The first version had it at an all-time high which it promptly corrected to suit its propaganda that it sunk to an all-time low of 62%, which is actually the highest for any post-Marcos President and this in the midst of the pandemic where his administration has been criticized to no end by the opposition. Dick Dastardly would probably come after Muttley already with his drats and double drats with this development! They have been at it for five years now with the same result. It’s simply not working.
The President signed his Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance (CONA) as the Vice-Presidential candidate of PDP-Laban. Reporma Chair Sen. Ping Lacson was swearing in new members and signing their respective CONAs as well in preparation for the filing of certificates of candidacy which begins next week. Opposition political analysts continue to label the NPC-Reporma Presidential bet as “Duterte-enabler” while also expecting him to give way to a common candidate once they get their act together. What I do know is while the Opposition has been running around like a headless chicken seemingly unaware of whether or not politics is addition or subtraction, the administration, NPC-Reporma and Aksyon Demokratiko have been adding to their ranks.
Robredo is like Nero fiddling while Rome burns or Wendy in Peter Pan who can’t ever figure out what she wants to do. If this is how she is now, do you still think that she’s fit to be President given how she fails at consensus-building and lacks the cognitive ability for the need to make decisions in a timely and orderly manner?",Politics
So now #CommunityPantry initiatives are being “red tagged” according to the communists,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/so-now-communitypantry-initiatives-are-being-red-tagged-according-to-the-communists/,"It’s been just several days since “community pantries” had become a social media sensation and over that short period they’ve been reduced to a political ball being kicked around in the vast football field that is the Philippine national political “debate”. The Philippine Opposition have pretty much taken possession of this ball and their game plan has now become quite evident. Apparently, community pantries are now being “red tagged”.
But of course.
The modus operandi of the Yellowtards (the bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and their communist henchmen has long been evident:
Step 1: Associate a grassroots community iniative to their dishonest “cause”.
Step 2: Paint these initiatives as a “response” to the “incompetence” of a “corrupt” incumbent “regime”.
Step 3: Make the organisers of these initiatives into “victims” of “red tagging” when accused of baldly politicising them.
Stir.
Repeat.
There is no sense of civic mindedness in the Philippines that escapes the fallout from politicisation bombs that the Yellowtards and communists routinely drop whenever they catch a whiff of opportunity to stir up “dissent” that could be used as foundation for sedition or even rebellion. Everything from campus activism, women’s issues, workers’ rights, feminism, and what are essentially common cooperative initiatives like these community pantries are candidates for — and eventually victims of — communist infiltration.
Most bizarre of all, the Opposition now lazily use “red tagging” as a catch-all label to demonise anything the police do as part of their mandated duties. A constituency too lazy to unpack issues and evaluate these with critical minds is fertile ground to propagate the sort of intellectual dishonesty these shills apply to achieving their crooked political ends.
There’s bigger fish to fry as far as the strategic direction the Philippines needs to take to become a sustainably-prosperous modern society. When we see the top “thought leaders” of the Opposition busy clucking amongst themselves about local-level initiatives like “community pantries” one wonders what sort of government they will form in the unlikely event that they seize political power. Even more disturbing, if ordinary Filipinos can’t be left to their devices sorting themselves out within their small individual circles of influence without being roped into hopelessly-politicised “causes” and weaponised in so-called “revolutions” that aim to topple legitimately-elected governments, what motivation is left for garden-variety civic-mindedness in Philippine society?
The amount of damage the Yellowtards and communists are wreaking on Philippine society is alarming to say the least. They are a serious social cancer that need to arrested soonest. The job is not done yet. Even if Yellowtardism had been knocked out in 2016 and again in 2019, they are by no means crushed. Then again, the 2022 elections are just around the corner and if their lack of focus on preparing that is any indication, it is likely they are looking to more crooked approaches to achieving their political ends.",Politics
2022 presidentiables: political baggage and business friendliness as major criteria,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/2022-presidentiables-political-baggage-and-business-friendliness-as-major-criteria/,"I was discussing with a friend on Messenger the other night about potential Presidential candidates and we narrowed it down  to three probables in case Sara Duterte doesn’t run. It came down to Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, former Senator Bongbong Marcos (BBM), and convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes. His preference was for Isko because Trillanes he thought more of a nuisance and BBM carried baggage and would be too divisive.
Delving deeper into the criteria, he mentioned about the sanctity of contracts, specifically Manila and Maynilad Water and ABS-CBN. According to him, businessmen didn’t take too kindly to the tirades President Rodrigo Duterte directs at at the three companies. Ayala had to sell to Enrique Razon, who has close ties to the administration while Manny Pangilinan had no choice but to give in to a renegotiation of the concession contract despite emerging victorious out of arbitration in Singapore.
It was an open secret that these concession agreements were sweetheart deals when the water concession was privatized during the administration of former President Fidel Ramos. This began during the Cory Aquino administration and continued throughout that of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s (GMA’s) with the oil industry deregulation and the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA), which were all supposed to foster competition and result in lower prices but had the reverse effect with the formation of cartels and rampant fuel smuggling.
The question which comes to mind is, do you think the President did the right thing in strong arming these companies into submission? The friend said that the President’s actions tend to scare away foreign investors because the rule of law wasn’t respected. But what if the process of negotiation was rigged in favor of the concession holders? What protection does the average Pinoy have?
There has been this probability propounded that the Presidential endorsement won’t carry much weight going into the final months of Duterte’s term. There is supposedly an increasing number of what could be termed as sway voters; those whose voting preference could be changed as the elections draw near. There is also the demographics to take into account considering the 21-49 age group is equivalent to 40 million voters. This is just an estimate because the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) doesn’t have hard data in its database. It doesn’t even have an updated voters list which takes into account the newly-registered voters.
Of course, everything is speculation at this point. But it does seem to appear that Isko just might be able to pull off a victory in a head-to-head matchup with BBM. It’s thus imperative that Sara runs. If she doesn’t, then the Opposition will throw its weight behind Isko. Regions 5 and 6 specifically.

Tina Panganiban-Perez was right to ask if #CommunityPantry organiser Ana Patricia Non had links to communist groups,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/tina-panganiban-perez-was-right-to-ask-if-communitypantry-organiser-ana-patricia-non-had-links-to-communist-groups/,"You either are or aren’t a communist. How difficult is it to answer a “yes” or “no” when asked, Are you a communist? Evidently, very difficult. This fact about the Philippines’ political and cultural minefield was brought to the fore when, in a recent press conference given by Ana Patricia Non, founder of the Maginhawa Community Pantry, GMA News reporter Tina Panganiban-Perez asked “Meron ka nga bang link sa communist groups?” (“Could you confirm if you actually do have links with communist groups?”). As a result of this simple question, Panganiban-Perez became the latest whipping girl of members of the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists who had taken to social media to whip up an  outrage fad around this.
The context behind this latest outrage fad is in reports that Non had shut down her community pantry initiative due to what she described as incidents of “red tagging” coming out against her. One would think then that if her reasons were such, then the natural question would then be whether said “red-tagging” actually does have bases. This is likely to be the motivation behind Panganiban-Perez’s line of question. In short, Panganiban-Perez was only doing her job laying the factual groundwork for the report she will presumably have filed following this conference.
Indeed, there are other bases as well to justify why such questions need to be asked of Non. As of this writing, what seems to be Non’s Facebook profile, “AP Non”, is publicly-accessible and, as such, fair game for reference. Noteworthy features of this profile include a background image of a protest rally where a banner screaming “PAG HINDI UMALSA ANG MASA, WALANG TINAPAY SA MESA” (“If the masses do not revolt, there will be no bread on the table”). The slogan is attributed to communist front and “women’s issues” group (so they claim) GABRIELA. The profile image used is a black background upon which the words “WE CRIED A RIVER NOW WE FIGHT BACK #OustDuterteNow” is written.
It is on this profile that Non seemingly announced her decision to shut down her community pantry in a post dated yesterday, the 21st April. Among other events documented on her timeline is her participation in the “Grand Mananita” rally held in the Diliman Campus of the University of the Philippines (UP) in June last year.
It is evident then if these are indeed content she had published herself on Facebook that Non is a supporter of initiatives that (1) aim to unseat the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte outside of established institutional processes and (2) incite the masses to revolt as a means to put “bread on the table”. It is reasonable then to expect a journalist worth her salt to use these observations collectively as context for the hard questions that certain members of the “activist” communities Non consorts with find uncomfortable. It is quite ironic that these very “activists” who habitually assert the entitlement of journalists to ask such hard questions are the very same ones now trying to muzzle Tina Panganiban-Perez.
In his Manila Times column “A crisis in truth seeking”, Professor Antonio Contreras writes…
I am in deep awe at investigative reporters who are able to pore over documents, some of which are even classified and secret, and interview well-placed sources, some of whom are even working for their own governments who, protected by the assurance of secrecy as a confidential source, would provide vital and credible information about the inner workings behind every government decision, or scandal.
Here, Contreras refers to those traditional bogeymen — states and governments — as roadblocks to “truth seeking”. Funny enough in this recent instance, on the question of whether or not Non is a communist, it seems it is the so-called “activists” and “thought leaders” of the Opposition who have taken the role of the personas traditionally associated with efforts to thwart said “truth seeking”. Here, again, we see the hypocritical selective nature of Yellowtard and communist “activism” on exhibit. Indeed, it is easy to see now what sorts of regimes these people would put in effect in the event they succeed at seizing power.",Politics
“Helping the poor” is an OBSOLETE election campaign platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/helping-the-poor-is-an-obsolete-election-campaign-platform/,"Filipino voters are just so done over by those “helping the poor” ululations that pepper today’s “activist” rhetoric. This is the big lesson the Philippine Opposition need to learn if they are to win in 2022. That sort of rhetoric is simply not consistent with the way Philippine society is structured. You can see it most starkly in the way the rich cloister themselves within fortified residential enclaves patrolled by private armies. That reality does not sit well when one considers that the most chi chi “thought leaders” of wokedom grew up — and continue to tap their “activist” slogans into their 1000-dollar iPads — within those very walls. The sight of this private school set pontificating about the “plight” of the “poor” is quite rich indeed. Literally.
This pretty much illustrates the crisis of relevance the Opposition suffers today. They foolishly built their entire political brand on “helping the poor”. No less than their default “leader” of the moment, “vice president” Leni Robredo, had channelled most of her media mileage expenditure to publicity stunts that aim to showcase her “helping the poor” initiatives. Suffice to say, all of these PR stunts fell flat on their faces. Many have backfired badly thanks to the silly grin Robredo habitually sports while inserting herself in the midst of otherwise grim situations. For that matter, many of these supposedly “grim” situations were only made to look so on the back of the million-peso creative license Robredo’s army of consultants apply to these PR jobs.
Looking further back, this was also the same idiotic approach that resulted in then presidential candidate Mar Roxas copping derision and ridicule from across a big swathe of the partisan spectrum. Roxas, like Robredo, amassed a trove of “helping the poor” collateral owing to a similarly tone-deaf PR team. Photos and videos of Roxas doing masa stuff like carrying a sack of onions on his shoulder, directing traffic in the rain, and doing carpentry work on school desks set social media on fire in the Philippines — in all the wrong ways. This poor form carried over to poor poll results, all but paving the way for a landslide victory in 2016 for current President Rodrigo Duterte.
The message is clear — or, more importantly, should have been clear — to the powers-that-be of the Philippine Opposition:
Poverty porn no longer works.
That’s bad news for the Opposition. The Yellowtards (the biggest bloc within the opposition consisting of chi chi members rabidly-loyal to the Aquinio-Cojuangco clan) and the communists (consisting of the most militant and most violent of its members) set the themes and lead the thinking that define the Philippine Opposition today. Both sport ideologies built on the back of doctrines that frame the the poor as “victims” of “sinister” and “reactionary” state forces. Presented this way with the state and government always portrayed as the bad guys, the Yellowtards and communists are at liberty to espouse and justify illegal means of acquiring power — the Yellowtards with their “people power” street “revolution” (fancy words for coup d’état) and the communists with their “people’s revolution” that aims to install their dreaded “dictatorship of the proletariat”.
Those notions are now all but obsolete yet the Opposition stubbornly adhere to them — and remain beholden to the personalities behind them — despite suffering no less than two catastrophic national election defeats in 2016 and 2019. You wonder then: Do Filipinos really deserve the idiocy that today’s Opposition habitually exhibit? Definitely not. A modern and intelligent Opposition is essential to the modern, stable, and healthy democracy that Filipinos aspire to. An Opposition led by the Yellowtards and communists is anything but any of that. It’s time Filipinos put their foot down and demand that their Opposition ditch all that baggage and step up to be the Opposition Filipinos deserve. The next elections are just around the corner. The clock is ticking fast.",Politics
Inday Sara – Digong “Daughterte-Duterte” tandem puts 2022 in the bag for admin camp,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/inday-sara-digong-daughterte-duterte-tandem-puts-2022-in-the-bag-for-admin-camp/,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is the political equivalent of Dolphy whose comedic timing was impeccable — so unlike comedians of today who rely on their gender and insults to get laughs. The idea of Duterte as Vice President was first floated by Bong Go. It didn’t resonate with voters. Even the so-called “Duterte Die-hard Supporter” (DDS) community reacted by saying the President should retire and spend time with his grandchildren. But when it came from the President himself, his base was all agog with the idea of a Daughterte-Duterte tandem.
Ana Marie Pamintuan writes in her PhilSTAR piece “VP Duterte?”…
Perhaps GMA and Erap have inspired Duterte – barred from seeking reelection – to run for a lower post in 2022.
Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo told us on One News’ “The Chiefs” last Tuesday that the President was open to the possibility of seeking the second highest post in the land in 2022 – if there is “a strong public clamor” for it.
The 2022 election is a game-changer because the traditional campaign is out on account of the COVID-19 virus. The pioneering political campaign management company in the country has been conducting a series of webinars about campaigning in the new normal. This means a digital-focused campaign run on both traditional and social media platforms. It has to be a meld of both due to the nature of the platform’s audience reach being limited by connectivity in the regions.
Foremost on the minds of average Filipinos is how to move forward from the uncertainty and disruption wrought by the pandemic. Economic issues have top priority; employment, job security, social amelioration, inflation. Next up is education. School year 2020-2021 saw the public education system being overwhelmed by transferrees from private education institutions. Will the coming school year see the same trend being repeated? There is also the issue of the quality of flexible and remote learning. Access to mobile devices and connectivity and the quality of the Department of Education’s printed modules are the main points of contention.
The Opposition, however, would like to make the South China Sea an issue. This may be so in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the regional urban hubs but in the far-flung corners of the country it won’t have much of an impact. Survival is the priority for Filipinos in these areas. The Opposition has limited itself to changing public opinion through an organized negative media campaign. It’s about time they present an alternative platform to the people.
As it is, it remains to be seen which Opposition groups actually ascribe to 1Sambayan as the opposition coalition. This early, infighting has broken out over those who argue that there should be no selection process for the opposition standard-bearer and that the default should be Vice President Leni Robredo. The latter is up to her old tricks again playing coy, naive and dumb, which comes naturally to her.
A Daughterte-Duterte tandem (Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte for president and, her father, running as VP) would render the May 2022 election moot. The administration has enough of a track record to sell itself to voters though it would definitely have to make improvements on its platform of government. Duterte has been sneakily inserting reform measures in the agenda of the lower House. This was the purpose behind the election of Lord Allan Velasco as Speaker. The Senate is where the problem is. Ten Senators are up for re-election. They need campaign funds so it will not happen for them if they will go against the wishes of their political patrons.
My fearless forecast is the masa will think more and think better, and the usual formula for electability will not apply. The Opposition has no choice but to lay down their cards first. 1Sambayan has scheduled this for June 12. The administration will move shortly after this. Barring any serious issues between the power blocs, the latter will most likely unite behind one tandem. Duterte is one who keeps his cards very close to his chest so it will be likely that the final lineup will not be revealed until October when the deadline for filing certificates of candidacy is. He may even pull the same stunt he did in 2015 by substituting at the very last minute.
Whatever happens, 2022 will be the year a new chapter in Philippine politics begins.",Politics
“Red tagging” is an intellectually-dishonest red herring communists use to mask their crimes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/red-tagging-is-an-intellectually-dishonest-red-herring-communists-use-to-mask-their-crimes/,"Shhhh…. Listen for a minute in silence. Do you hear that? That’s right. That’s the sound of Filipino “activists” still complaining about being “red tagged”. In fact, it’s the only argument they throw against efforts being mounted by the Philippine Government to eradicate the communist cancer from our society. But think about it for a minute and ask:
What exactly does it mean to be “red tagged”?
For one thing, communists identify themselves using the colour red. So what’s the problem with being “red tagged”, right? Second, very few Filipinos will dispute allegations that “progressive” groups like Anakbayan, Gabriela, the Kilusang Mayo Uno, the League of Filipino Students, Bayan Muna, and the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) whose members enjoy absolute editorial control over university “journalism”, among others, are all barely-legal fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). As such, all of them are, by association, sympathetic to the goals of the terrorist arm of the CPP, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Thirdly, there is something intellectually-dishonest about summarily labelling an effort to investigate and crackdown on illegal activities as “red tagging”. Filipino communists are using this label as a curtain to obscure objective examination of details pertinent to really understanding the problem of the Philippines’ communist infestation at the right level. There is a hypothesis being tested here — that personalities accused of “being CPP card-bearing members” that “have been involved in some way in the armed rebellion” are engaged in activities that pose a danger to Filipino citizens. This is the simple position of the Philippine Government on the matter as articulated by National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Insurgency (NTF-ELCAC) spokesperson, Southern Luzon Command chief Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade reported by the Inquirer back in late January. Clearly, the government continues to gather evidence and connect the dots — part and parcel of business-as-usual intelligence work.
For Parlade, NPA members who surrendered to the government could prove it. He said ex-rebels pinpointed several members of above-ground groups as CPP-NPA members, including Colmenares.
“It’s not for me to decide on the cases but I have been involved in the discussions, that’s why I know that the evidence we have can implicate them. The testimonies of former rebels from Negros, from which he (Colmenares) is from also have a huge bearing. So how will evade that, those are former rebels who were with him in scouting and planning?” he pointed out.
Parlade admits that pursuit of the banking angle is still in its early stages but progressing nontheless.
“Bank accounts, it’s hard to establish bank accounts but that’s on the process, well AMLC is in charge here, but there are movements of money. You know the deposits, they just amount to around $100 to $200, that’s coming from abroad, then they will close the account, and then open it again,” Parlade claimed.
“That’s what happened to the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines and the Belgian NGOs. Who are the beneficiaries of these accounts? It’s Gabriela. Now, who [is] accepting these funds?  Well, not all go to the Communist Party of the Philippines, NPA, but a good 60 percent goes to the CPP-NPA. And these are all corroborated by these former rebels, especially those involved in the financial transactions of the CPP,” he added.
The astounding thing to be noted about this exercise is in how, outside of these government efforts, nobody in the Opposition seems the least bit curious about investigating whether there actually is a fire that accounts for all this smoke. And this is the point that needs to be highlighted here — that it is the job of the military to act on intelligence in much the same way that the police are duty-bound to investigate every instance where a crime may have occurred.
Bayan Muna chair and former Rep. Neri Colmenares, would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate.
Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections.
“One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent).  That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino.
“The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added.
Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat.
According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda.
He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate.
Note that nothing in what Colmenares contributes to the conversation addresses any of the facts or investigative angles that Parlade shares and invites all to examine. Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case.
One thing is clear, however. The buzzword “red tagging” is just another one of the old Cold War era ululations that communists use to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside. It has since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building.",Politics
"Leni Robredo is, indeed, President of the Republic of Twitter",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/leni-robredo-is-indeed-president-of-the-republic-of-twitter/,"Will Leni Robredo win a national election if it were to be held, say, next week? It is likely that even her staunchest supporters in the Opposition — even those within its most rabid bloc, the Yellowtards — wouldn’t put money on her. Nonetheless, that does not stop opposition partisans, most notably their top “thought leaders”, from embracing the delusion that Robredo is the Philippines “real” leader.
Perhaps the thousands of Twitter “likes” and “retweets” are an irresistible opiate that Robredo’s worshippers use to escape the reality that the broader Opposition is no where near the shape it should be in to go head-to-head with a popular incumbent. With just a handful of months to go before campaign season for the next national elections start, the Opposition lacks a platform (or at least a narrative) of substance and, more importantly, a leader who is charismatic across party lines. Thus, they continue to latch on to “vice president” Leni Robredo who, for now, is the only key Opposition personality who possesses the wherewithal to sustain an old-school PR campaign that uses disaster grandstanding and appeals to victimhood as its primary fodder.
Interestingly enough, the title of Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco’s latest piece “Leaders and disasters” encapsulates the defensive position the Opposition now takes in the midst of the public opinion fallout following the misguided PR campaign Robredo’s handlers mounted to exploit this year’s big typhoon and volcano disasters. In his piece, Lasco laments, “In a less divided nation, her actions would surely have earned plaudits across the political spectrum.” That is true of course. The reality, as Lasco admits, is far from that and, needless to say, far from fair. After all, that’s just what life is, isn’t it? Unfair. Lasco also seeks to absolve Robredo of any partisanism in her “relief” efforts appealing to his readers that, “contrary to attempts to cast her as someone trying to bring down the President, the Vice President has been restrained in her criticism—more restrained than many in the opposition want her to be. Despite the hate she has received, she has not returned the negativity, and her pushbacks were to correct disinformation, not to foment it. Throughout the past four years, she has always been respectful toward the President, even if the reverse is far from the truth.”
All true. No argument there. The trouble is, Father Reality favours neither the “righteous” nor the “victims”. It favours those who play the game well. Democracy, after all is (in the parlance of techos and marketers) a gamified form of governance. Votes are a scoring mechanism to determine who gets to rule under the current system Filipinos signed up to. The irony that escapes the faculties of Robredo’s fandom is that just like their obsession with the use of numbers of “retweets” and “likes” on Twitter as measures of community validation on Twitter, votes too are measures of validation on the real political landscape. For that matter, the results of public approval surveys conducted by firms such as SWS and Pulse Asia too are measures of validation over the range within which the soundness of their measurement facilities hold.
Blindly favouring Twitter as a measure over votes or over SWS surveys is the red herring Robredo’s Yellowtard fandom are using as their political opiate. Twitter likes and retweets are valid as a measure within Twitter, just as votes are valid within the legal frame. SWS and Pulse Asia, for their parts, are crystal clear and upfront with regard to the range of the soundness of their statistical analyses.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is President of the Philippines because the constitutionally-institutionalised election system says so. It seems the Yellowtards regard Leni Robredo as their “leader” because Twitter’s scoring system says so. Very well then. By all means, let the Opposition declare Leni Robredo president of the Republic of Twitter. Meanwhile, the election that will determine who will be leader of the Republic of the Philippines is just around the corner. For their sake, the Opposition better have a strategy to win that more important game.",Politics
"Twitter shut down @realDonaldTrump, so it should also shut down the CPP-NPA’s @prwc_info account",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/twitter-shut-down-realdonaldtrump-so-it-should-also-shut-down-the-cpp-npas-prwc_info-accont/,"Only fair, right? The basis of Twitter recently shutting down the account of United States president Donald Trump is “due to the risk of further incitement of violence” that it presumably exposes the American public to.
Twitter references its policy on the nature of such behaviour and the actions it holds prerogative to take on users who violate it. On a blog posted specific to the action it took against the US president it reiterates, “we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.”
That same blog also cites Twitter’s Glorification of Violence policy…
We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”.
The policy stipulates that included as violations are tweets that glorify, praise, condone, or celebrate “attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent extremism policy)”.
As such, this draws attention to overdue consideration of the tweets being fielded by the Communist Party of the Philippines through its account @prwc_info where it glorifies the activities of its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Just one example of the impunity with which the CPP-NPA routinely glorifies its terrorist activities is in this recent tweet…
Indeed, a Stanford University report describes the history and capacity for deadly violence of the NPA and its combatants…
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
The same Stanford report describes current party-list group Bayan Muna as “a political party connected to the CPP and other groups in the Communist movement.” According to an ABS-CBN News report Bayan Muna is part of the Makaybayan bloc of left-leaning party-lists that include “Gabriela, Kabataan, Anakpawis, Migrante, and Alliance of Concerned Teachers.”
So did Twitter act fairly when it “permanently suspended” the account of the President of the United States? Perhaps yes, though I did elaborate on the implications of such an act when I posed the question earlier; Should Twitter and Facebook block Donald Trump? However, to be truly regarded as fair, Twitter should act fairly and consider all accounts that issue tweets that could be regarded as acts of inciting insurrection and glorifying violence.",Politics
Twitter is now officially more powerful than the US Government,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/twitter-is-now-officially-more-powerful-than-the-us-government/,"Hats off to Big Corporate Social Media. They first started out as little websites where people could “share” stuff and engage in “social networking”. Then they started to call themselves “platforms” and rightly so as such was to become their reach, ubiquity, and deep embedding into the fabric of society that people could be forgiven for thinking that they actually were the Internet itself.
As they continued in their unprecedented growth into the virtual sovereign digital states that they are today, Big Corporate Social Media’s services had become just as essential to life as the public services that conventional governments guarantee their respective citizens. As such, they gained the same power over millions of people’s lives and wellbeing once associated only with national governments.
Today, Twitter “permanently suspended” the account of no less than the President of the United States. That officially makes Twitter more powerful than the US Government itself — and, disturbingly, more powerful than America’s enemies.
The irony here is in how it succeeded in doing what US President Donald Trump’s enemies can only pay lip service to doing for now — impeach and silence the President within its private sovereign realm. It did so in less than one tenth of the time it would likely have taken the whole US democratic apparatus to deliver the same result. And it did so with none of the transparency America’s democratic apparatus owes its participants.
Twitter is, of course, a private enterprise and its network and infrastructure private property. Thus its powers-that-be can allow — or disallow — anyone access to its platform. But, see, that is why it is more powerful than the US government. Twitter’s Netizens have no alternative place to go. Twitter enjoys the scale and the benefit of massive network ubiquity to render most alternatives effectively inconsequential. In a different context, that fact alone has for some time been the basis for antitrust rumblings in various quarters. In the context of Trump’s ouster from the platform, Twitter’s monopoly for now is regarded as a positive thing — selective tolerance of monopoly, right? And even if an alternative platform enterprise did emerge that could refuse to conform to today’s Facebook-Apple-Google-Twitter Axis, go its own, and succeed as a realistic alternative, who’s to say that this alternative would not one day behave the way Twitter does today?
For that matter, what if new social media networks hosted in other countries — notably “non-democratic” ones — emerge and host chatter deemed unacceptable to the “civil societies” of the West? Will Western countries start to put up their own versions of China’s Great Firewall to keep all that out?
The key thing to consider here is that Trump has an audience. In today’s hyper-networked world, voices find their audiences eventually. History is a trove of walls that had been put up by one empire or another but, in the end, the more competitive force won and the walls left standing that had become today’s quaint tourist destinations are testament to the futile hubris of wall-building.
The short of it is that the fact that Twitter had to resort to banishing US President Donald Trump highlights a long-unfolding failure of America’s coastal elite to win over his constituents competitively despite enjoying the backing of Big Corporate Mainstream Media and, of course, Big Corporate Social Media.",Politics
Ninoy was Dead Wrong: The Filipino is NOT worth dying for,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/ninoy-was-dead-wrong-the-filipino-is-not-worth-dying-for/,"Did the fake hero utter a lie when he said: The Filipino is worth dying for ?
Let’s do a little thought experiment: Recall that Filipina who was on death row abroad…Yes, Mary Jane Veloso, who was arrested and sentenced to death for smuggling heroin into Indonesia. Let’s have a show of hands. Who among you would volunteer to take her place so she could live?
Even giving your left kidney for your neighbor or relative is already something hardly anyone would consider, how much more sacrificing your one and only life for a Filipino stranger? One would not even offer to lose his/her 2 eyes (which one would value at a billion USD a piece) in exchange for the life of any politician (not even for Duterte or Pacquiao).
So really, was Ninoy serious about giving his life up for “the Filipino”? Best bet is… he just wanted to sound patriotic, and with such a quotable quote under his belt, actually earn him a place in the Pinoy hall of heroic fame (should any misfortune happen along the way).
For someone too rabidly infatuated with political power, fame and glory, why would he forfeit his life for fellow Filipinos? For a man willing to kill Filipinos to get to the throne or be so reckless enough to weaponize the communist cause just to wreak havoc, mayhem and destruction on Pres. Marcos’ administration, you will begin to doubt such a noble declaration of self-sacrifice.
This Ninoy guy was too hungry for satisfying political ambition, dying for anyone would be the last thing on his mind.
Before we dig deeper, how do we measure worth? Typically, it’s about output. If you’re a lazy scumbag, people would call you worthless. If one were a creative genius like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, then such a person would be a national treasure. And up to how high a value does it make something or someone worth exchanging your life for?
What is a Filipino’s intrinsic worth?
So yes, that famous line by Ninoy was likely all just for show, or the guy was just outright lying through his teeth. If he knew for sure a bullet was coming for him at the tarmac that day he never would have taken that flight back to the Philippines.
The fact is: Filipinos are NOT worth dying for. (Well maybe for resource-rich Philippines – yes; but for the residents?) Are we such special and rare specimens of the human race to be worth preserving? Ask Donald Trump of Jack Ma if they would die for a Filipino. Who in the world esteems Filipinos that highly to actually die for them? With his categorical denials, not even our national hero Jose Rizal was actually willing to face the firing squad for the revolution he unintentionally ignited.
Sorry to rain on your parade (esp. for Yellow folks), but all this celebration for a man who was actually a traitor and a terrorist all for the grand delusion of Presidential glory is a complete waste of time and attention.
If you want Filipinos worth dying for, try learning rocket science with ambitions to fly to Mars. Probably by then, people will scramble to become human shields just to protect such a high-value asset. And finally, while you process this article (in probably denial stage), here’s the breaking news of the week…

The Philippine Opposition has declared the Philippines a DICTATORSHIP,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/the-philippine-opposition-has-declared-the-philippines-a-dictatorship/,"What’s a political opposition to do when it can’t win an election and sees no hope of ever winning one again legitimately. What else but seize power illegally. This is why they now would like everyone to believe the Philippines is a “dictatorship” — so that they could do just that.
For all their efforts trying to convince everyone that they are pro-democracy and pro-freedom, today’s Opposition don’t see the irony in their being the first to declare the Philippines a “dictatorship”. No less than former solicitor general and failed senatorial candidate in the 2019 national elections Florin “Pilo” Hilbay insists that Filipinos “ARE in a dictatorship”.
If, according to Hilbay, there is indeed a “struggle against tyranny” to be had, he would be the last person Filipinos should be looking to for leadership. In a modern democracy such as the Philippines’ where institutions, due process, and systems actually work, no such notion of a “struggle” of that sort exists. Filipinos are given every chance to choose their leaders and representatives and hold them to account — through elections, for example. Hilbay, back in 2019, failed to convince Filipinos to select him to be one of their representatives. So everyone behold the whiner that Pilo Hilbay is today following that catastrophic failure on his part. What Hilbay is saying is nonsense in essence. What “struggle” is he talking about?
There can really be only one motive behind why the Philippine Opposition are rabidly focused on gas-lighting Filipinos into believing that their county is a “dictatorship”. Key to understanding this bizarre political strategy is to look back to the days when the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan seen to be the leaders of the Opposition) were the top dogs. Back in the 1980s, a “dictator” was an essential character in the Yellowtards’ dishonest narrative of victimisation and worship of “freedom fighters” and tank-facing nuns. That time, they succeeded in turning that narrative into political power. Evidently they are trying to use the same playbook to seize power again.
This is also the reason they would like Filipinos to remain stuck in the past and trembling as they “remember” those “Martial Law Years”. Instead of encouraging people to imagine what they could be, today’s Opposition emotionally-blackmail them to remain fearful of that which they must not be “again”.
The Yellowtards, in short, derive power from a stunted society, one that is unable to move on from a perception of a past they manufactured for their political ends. This is why the Yellowtards’ biggest fear is that Filipinos forget and move on from having to “remember” the “Martial Law Years” — because when Filipinos do, their obsolete Yellow narrative of prayerful “heroes” crumbles and, along with it, their hopes of a return to their glory days.",Politics
Who killed ABS-CBN? Its “news” team did!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/who-killed-abs-cbn-its-news-team-did/,"It is too bad that employees of embattled media network ABS-CBN are paying for the sins of the “journalists” of the network’s “Current Affairs” Department. After all, the primary reason ABS-CBN rubbed the powers-that-be the wrong way is because of the slanted, sloppy, mediocre “reporting” it passed off to hapless Filipino viewers as “journalism”.
It is interesting, however, to see how the media giant is now calling on its showbiz “talent” and the throngs in their respective “fandoms” to come to its rescue. Fronting the current entertainment (what they call “activism” nowadays) is newly-crowned “hero” of the Kapamilya mob Angel Locsin who now leads a campaign to emotionally blackmail her colleagues into joining the “fight” (this fight being some sort of nebulous effort to magically renew ABS-CBN’s franchise to broadcast very likely outside of due process).
It is too bad Locsin cannot simply scream “Darna” and fly off with fist thrust forward to vanquish her “enemy” (however way she and her fans define it). In Locsin, Kapamilya fans very likely continue to see the same fictional comic book hero they grew up with and, perhaps, ogled in lockstep watching Locsin in the lead role of Darna on TV in 2005. Guess who was laughing all the way to the bank following the success of that franchise? Why, no less than the shareholders of ABS-CBN!
To be fair, the only hope of ABS-CBN winning the quaint PR “war” they are waging today lies in starlets such as Angel Locsin. This is because their top-gun telejournalist celebs — the likes of Karen Davila and Korina Sanchez, to name a couple — have become liabilities to such a dishonest campaign. Indeed, it is quite telling that the network would now rather have an old Darna actress speak for their cause rather than these “current affairs” stalwarts who one would have thought would be in better positions to speak to the core issues of this matter.
Goes to show ABS-CBN have neither legal nor political leg to stand on. They are mobilising popularity to address what is essentially a foregone administrative matter their execs, led by that other accidental “hero” Carlo Katigbak, failed to manage competently.",Politics
Is #OustDuterte all that the Opposition could come up with?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/is-oustduterte-all-that-the-opposition-could-come-up-with/,"I mean, any schmoe can come up with a hashtag and “trend” it on Twitter. So here’s a classic: “#OustDuterte”. Right. And then what?
Actually there is an even more important question that needs to be answered before that: How exactly are you going to go about “ousting” Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte?
This is the reason the Opposition continues to fail to win people over — because they make promises they cannot keep. They come up with slogans they cannot substantiate with a clear plan. It is basically a simple failure to evolve from the 1980s-vintage “oust” rhetoric they remain addicted to. Beyond these tired old calls, they offer nothing to the Filipino people.
What is ironic is that the Opposition, specially the leading bloc within them rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) claim to be the foremost authority on Philippine “democracy”. Yet these are the very same people calling for a change in leadership outside the frame of democratic process.
Democracy, after all, demands discipline and intelligence of its practitioners. Without discipline, you get the anarchy that the Yellowtards and their communist allies espouse. Without intelligence, you get the bankrupt rhetoric of empty hashtags and slogans that make up today’s Opposition platform (if one can even call it that). If the Opposition are truly serious about leading their country, they will need to come up with something to lead the Filipino people towards. So far they offer no such vision.
What does that leave the Opposition? Nothing other than a lust for power. Indeed, without a platform and without a vision, a rhetoric that revolves around not much else other than the “ouster” of a sitting duly-elected leader describes nothing beyond that. The promising thing about the Philippines is that its people have shown evidence that they are able to see through all the pretense of “decency” of the Yellowtards’ facade.
If the Opposition want to be victorious in the next election, they will need to work doubly hard to rebrand themselves as a genuine Opposition — one that offers alternatives and not just destruction. A healthy democracy is one where an intelligent Opposition offers a constructive counterbalance to the government. Sadly the Philippines’ Opposition in its current form is not up to the task fulfilling that vital role. Because of this failure, asking that other question — And then what? — is a pointless exercise.",Politics
Chel Diokno is endangering Filipino lives by undermining government efforts to stop COVID-19,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/chel-diokno-is-endangering-filipino-lives-by-undermining-government-efforts-to-stop-covid-19/,"Opposition “thought leaders” are currently at arms because of what they perceive to be a “lambasting” that “human rights” lawyer and failed 2019 elections candidate Chel Diokno copped from President Rodrigo Duterte the other night. Indeed, Duterte spoke angrily about Diokno in his last press conference after the latter continued to issue statements seemingly meant to incite citizens to mass action against the government.
Siyempre nakikiusap tayong manatili lahat sa bahay, pero labag na sa Konstitusyon ang ordinansang ito. Ang ""24-hour curfew"" ay outright denial of the right to travel and freedom of movement. (1/2)https://t.co/4qZXem0Oy8
— Chel Diokno | #51AkbayanPartylist (@ChelDiokno) March 21, 2020
Diokno is evidently on a campaign to counter the measures being put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The measures include limits on mobility and on the number of people who may gather in public as well as curfews. Diokno follows a classic but overused playbook favoured by left-leaning holdovers from the heyday of “people power” rhetoric that highlights “parallels” with the “Martial Law Era” of the 1970s and early 1980s whenever any Philippine government hints at stronger powers to manage crisis situations.
A pandemic is not the time to be defying strong measures being implemented by the government to avert a catastrophic loss of life should the pandemic snowball. This was something Duterte, rightly so, will not tolerate at a time such essential measures need to be taken seriously.
“Just try and converge since you say it is your Constitutional right to do so. You say you are right. I say you are wrong. So try to invite 10 people to converge and see if I don’t haul you first to prison,” he said.
Countries that have taken strong measures — including curtailing certain civil liberties — are showing better results containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to countries that dither on using state forces to enforce much needed measures. In Australia, for example, fines of up to $5000 could be slapped on people found to be congregating in numbers of more than two. Unlike in deeply-divided societies like the Philippines where Opposition personalities such as Diokno encourage people to defy government orders, such police action is often unnecessary as people recognise and trust the authority of their elected leaders to look after the public interest.
Perhaps Filipinos and, specially, their Opposition “thought leaders” should observe the hard lessons their former colonial master, the United States, is learning…
The extreme partisan divide in the United States has not helped public health messaging in that country either, as a recent article in The Atlantic graphically illustrated. Under the headline “The Social Distancing Culture War Has Begun”, the writer observed a group of elderly Republicans on an Atlanta golf course making “a show of shaking hands, and complaining loudly about the ‘stupid hoax’ being propagated by virus alarmists”.
Like imperial overlord like vassal state?
It seems the colonial fruit did not fall too far away from the old colonisers. The trouble with “activists” like Chel Diokno is in how difficult it is to work out whether they are genuine in their claim to be “looking out for the public interest” or merely just posturing for media mileage in the lead up to the next national elections which, interestingly enough, is just around the corner.
Whatever the case, Diokno is certainly not helping. This is a time when Filipinos need to work together rather than against each other. The trouble with an Opposition camp that is starved for relevance and charismatic leadership is that it habitually finds the low and easy road to take — one involving merely tearing down the incumbent government to further its dishonest agenda.",Politics
June 12 “Mañanita” for Philippine “Independence” Day hijacked by communists!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/june-12-mananita-for-philippine-independence-day-hijacked-by-communists/,"It’s that time of the year again when the quaint story of a country that fought for independence in 1898 and lost then became “independent” because a bunch of shrill people said so unilaterally gets told. The authors of this story evidently take to heart an old truism often attributed to the chi chi profession of “journalism”: Don’t let the facts get in the way of a good story.
It is no coincidence then that the little clique of “thought leaders” who propagate the idea of a Philippine “independence” dating back to 1898 is the very same one that was behind the propagation of a more recent narrative that misled Filipinos for three decades. The idea that “revolutionary change” happened in 1986 after a street mob supposedly shouted down (or mass rosary-beaded) then President Ferdinand Marcos was a lie that an entire mass media industry went on to conspire with this mob to ingrain in the Filipino psyche. Small surprise that both the Mob and the entire industry now suffer a crisis of credibility.
It seems that this ideological wasteland left by the collapse of Big Corporate Media credibility and the catastrophic discredit of the narrative of the Yellowtards (the rabid bloc of the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) now serves as the foundation for the opportunistic resurgence of communist “activism” we are seeing today. The communists after all claim to own Filipino “nationalism” and this is evident in the dishonest names they give to the barely-legal fronts they put up that pretend to participate in legitimate politics.
The so-called Makabayan Bloc led by the communist Satur Ocampo representing the biggest coalition of communist front organisations in Congress is an example. This group claims that “Makabayan” in this regard stands for “Makabayang Koalisyon ng Mamamayan”, literally translated: “people’s nationalist coalition”. Sounds like a communist name, doesn’t it (think “People’s Republic of China”)? That’s because they, in fact, are communists. This group consists of people who are so confident in the effectiveness of the thin semblance of legitimacy they cloak their crooked intent with that they couldn’t even be bothered to pretend to distance themselves from that old Cold War ideological cancer.
This year, a rally dubbed “Grand Mañanita” that aims to piggyback on general festivities on the occasion of the June 12 “Independence Day” idea to push the agenda of opposing the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill is being organised by this suspect bunch.
One of the leading promoters of this rally is a group that calls itself the Movement Against Tyranny. It seems to be closely affiliated with Filipino communist fronts as evident in the Community section of its Facebook page where listed under its “Related Pages” section are known communist front groups such as the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), the People’s Alternative Media Network (Altermidya), Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU, or the Fist of May Movement), and IBON Foundation, among others.
A rally around an event that is supposed to represent the aspirations or sentiments of the general Filipino public had, in this instance, been politicised and, worse, co-opted into the narrow agenda of an extremist mob that aims to suppress a law that clearly targets the criminal elements they openly coddle. It is quite evident that the communists are filling a void in the rhetoric — one, perhaps, left open for hijacking by less radical cliques in the Opposition.
What hope then is there of any kind of true national movement that all Filipinos can relate to when every conversation and every occasion is bathed in a harsh partisan or ideological colour by a small but shrill community of radical “activists”? It is high time normal Filipinos take back their political chatter and redirect its focus back to what really matters.
If the framers of the notion that the Philippines did become “independent” in 1898 are truly serious about making that idea fly, they should reconsider allowing a bunch of crooked “activists” to simply hijack that notion and use it for their dishonest agendas.",Politics
How Filipinos can fix their broken “democracy”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/how-filipinos-can-fix-their-broken-democracy/,"Perhaps rightly so, Opposition partisans in the Philippines lament the way “democracy” is working for them nowadays. They lost an entire nation in the 2016 elections that catapulted former Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte to the presidency today and botched a chance to gain a foothold into Congress when they suffered a catastrophic loss in the 2019 national elections. Indeed, it is not that big a stretch to perceive Philippine “democracy” to be quite sick when you are at its losing end.
The trouble with this thinking is that it lacks perspective. If Opposition “thought leaders” step back for a minute and regard the complete picture, they will find that Philippine democracy is working as it should be; that is, according to how the 1987 Constitution intended it to. Leaders in the executive branch and representatives in the legislature are elected by popular vote within their respective jurisdictions. Worse, the Vice President is elected separately to the President — very likely a decision made by the framers of the Constitution informed by the paranoia over a possible “return to tyranny” that marked the period following the EDSA “revolution” of 1986.
In short, the Opposition led by a rabidly partisan bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) made their own bed when they signed up to the 1987 Yellowtard Constitution. This was a charter, after all, that put a premium on popularity over qualifications. The thinking at the time is that the “will of the people”, read the majority, rules. As it turns out, this was all just a euphemism for the oxymoron on exhibit today, that popularity makes it right.
How then do you “fix” democracy, seeing that democracy is, by its very nature, a popularity-makes-it-right ideology?
This is a question that haunts today’s democrats and liberals. When the very system you championed suddenly turns you into a loser, the natural recourse is to discredit this system. That’s coming in a bit late to the party. Back in mid-2015, I had already pointed out Filipinos’ rather retarded approach to participating in the democratic process…
Coming back closer to home, to the Philippine setting, we see the way Filipinos have also retarded themselves to using democracy as a mere toy rather than a real tool for modern governance. We can see in the Philippine national “debate” in the lead-up to the 2016 national elections that there is hardly any trace of intellectual substance in the rhetoric dished out by the Philippines’ so-called “thought leaders” and opinion shapers. The candidates being evaluated all fall far short of the bar set by real statesmen of a calibre that makes real sovereigns and real national leaders. Yet the national obsession remains fixated on the three- to four-odd bozos vying for that lucrative seat in Malacanang.
Nothing much has changed. Today’s Opposition, though boasting a who’s-who of chi chi private Catholic school educated partisans, “activists”, “thought leaders”, and “media practitioners”, has contributed very little to the uplift of the national “debate”. This is hardly surprising considering that an environment in which popularity holds primary currency does not provide fertile ground for intellectual conversation to thrive. This is also the reason mainstream media community had consistently failed to contribute to building a more intelligent society. This is because its members’ business models constrain them to channeling the bulk of their investment funds and resources towards delivering the lowest common denominator content to their audience — low-brow mass entertainment.
Democracy per se cannot be fixed. What can be fixed, however, is the quality of its participants. If Filipinos want to remain a democracy, they will need to participate in its processes more intelligently. It is quite evident that the Opposition are not up to the task of leading such an initiative. They remain fixated to a bad habit of negative campaigning — seeking to tear down rather than propose compelling alternatives to move forward. And as to that other big institution that presumes to “guide” Filipino thinking, the Roman Catholic Church, well, there is something to be said about an organisation that continues to uphold doctrines that its own officials deem exempt from critical scrutiny and challenge. The Yellowtards, mainstream media, and the Roman Catholic Church — institutions that exert strong influence over Filipinos — are all inherently incapable of evolving.
Filipinos should start their long-overdue evolution into smart participants in a modern democracy by rejecting the perverted leadership of the Yellowtards, mainstream media, and the Church. We could start by embracing independent thinking and turn our backs towards the obsolete tradition of idolatry — to self-appointed “thought leaders” and heroes, to credentials of dubious substance, and to medieval robes and sceptres — that characterises today’s political discourse. Only then can we begin a march to true democratic maturity.",Politics
The Opposition should stop blaming Duterte if they want to win the next election,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/the-opposition-should-stop-blaming-duterte-if-they-want-to-win-the-next-election/,"Gone are the days when demonising the incumbent worked for an Opposition party. Indeed, this is the lesson that today’s Philippine Opposition still hasn’t learned in the aftermath of the catastrophic loss of their Otso Diretso coalition in the 2019 election. That bunch hinged their entire campaign on a smear job on the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and look where that got them.
Unfortunately the Opposition, led by a bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (the Yellowtards), continue this sad tradition. They blamed inflation, traffic, the Taal Volcano eruption, and even the coronavirus outbreak among other things on Duterte while providing no solution or alternative to consider. They seem to remain comfy in their “success” in 1986 that they continue to latch on to where they used the same demonisation tactics against then President Ferdinand Marcos to seize power illegally.
The Yellowtard-led Opposition should move on from their failed Blame Duterte strategy and work a bit harder and apply a bit more imagination towards crafting a more modern and more innovative campaign platform. By being seen to be destructively critical of the Duterte government, they will fail to convert voters. However if they are able to present a better alternative to the Duterte Way, they might just succeed.
See, coming up with something better than the competition is hard work. Imagine trying to come up with, say, a better social media platform to beat Twitter and Facebook. Sounds impossible, right? This is the same challenge the Yellowtards face. The Duterte government may not be perfect, but it is the incumbent and has an enormous base of voters on its side. If the Opposition continue to apply the equivalent of a strategy to destroy Facebook and Twitter in order to seize the social media industry with a mediocre alternative, they will fail. They need to come up with something better.
It is ironic that “Laban” (“fight”) is considered to be the trademark rallying cry of the Yellowtard-led Philippine Opposition. The reality is that they are doing everything but fight. They merely whine, screech out their flaccid outrage fads, propagate their selective “activism”, sleep with former enemies, and take selfies that signal their virtue. All these no longer fly and will likely not fly in the coming months leading to the 2022 national elections.
The Opposition have a lot of work to do. This work should consist of smart work rather than the lame emotionalism that their top “thought” leaders favour. Filipinos deserve a modern and intelligent Opposition, not the lame, primitive, superstitious, and obsolete one they put up with today.",Politics
Was ABS-CBN Really Sold to the Marcoses and Returned to the Lopezes for FREE?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/was-abs-cbn-really-sold-to-the-marcoses-and-returned-to-the-lopezes-for-free/,"One thing that has been going around for years now in the Get Real Community as well as communities supporting the Duterte Presidency, the Marcoses and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano is the claim that the Lopezes sold ABS-CBN to the Marcoses and this was later given back to them for FREE by the former President Cory Aquino.
Versions of this claim was spread around by a number of strong social media influencers, one that caught my eye came from one named Mark Acebedo Lopez (who feels compelled to make it clear that he is not related to the ABS-CBN Lopezes, citing that he is directly descended from the Lopezes of Granada, Spain and not the Lo Pue’s of Southern China from which the ABS-CBN Lopezes came from).
In a post on Facebook dated April 2, 2017 which was shared over 2,000 times, Mark the heir of the Lopezes of Granada, Spain asserted:
This letter from the Lopez patriarch himself, however, indicate something else. More than cordial, Eugenio Lopez actually emphasized how he shared President Marcos’s vision for the country as he offered to sell the family’s stake in Meralco. This is in stark contrast to the narrative we often hear repeated by Yellow that Marcos undertook a hostile takeover of Meralco and ABS-CBN.
When Cory Aquino became president, she returned Meralco and ABS-CBN to the Lopezes free of charge, companies that have supposedly been bought and paid for by government (aka the Filipino people).
How lucky the Lopezes because they were paid when they sold it during the Marcos years, Cory subsequently returned the companies to them for free, and they profited a second time when they finally sold their stakes in Meralco not too long ago. Plus, the family still owns ABS-CBN.
Nabayaran ka na, ikaw pa rin ang may-ari, kumita at kumikita ka pa. Ayos.
Please spread the word.
The thing with Mark’s post and other similar posts that say that the Lopezes sold their companies to the Marcoses and the same companies were given back for FREE is that it is based on a bare claim.
What Mark and others shows us is a letter from Lopez Jr. offering, in this case, Meralco for sale, it doesn’t mean that Meralco had been sold. The proper proof of such a transaction would probably be documents showing the transfers of money and transfers of ownership.
If one were really interested in the circumstances and events showing how ABS-CBN was possessed by the Philippine government under then President Ferdinand Marcos is revealed in the Supreme Court Third Division decision contained in G.R. No. 133347 published on October 15, 2008. The decision was made on a petition for certiorari made by the Lopezes the Office of the Ombudsman, Roberto S. Benedicto, Exequiel B. Garcia, Miguel V. Gonzales, and Salvador “Buddy” Tan.
The petition challenges the Joint Resolution dated May 2, 1997 of then Ombudsman Aniano Desierto in OMB-0-94-1109, dismissing the complaint filed by petitioners against private respondents, and the Order denying their motion for reconsideration.
The Lopezes accused Benedicto, Garcia, and Tan of crimes penalized under the Revised Penal Code (RPC): (a) Article 298 – Execution of Deeds by Means of Violence or Intimidation; (b) Article 315 paragraphs 1[b], 2[a], 3[a] – Estafa; (c) Article 308 – Theft; (d) Article 302 – Robbery; (e) Article 312 – Occupation of Real Property or Usurpation of Real Rights in Property; and (f) Article 318 – Other Deceits.
And to head off any remarks that this is propaganda on behalf of ABS-CBN or the Lopezes (the ones from descended from Southern China not Granda, Spain) is that decision of the Supreme Court goes against their petition and in fact says that the government takeover of ABS-CBN was legal.
What the October 15, 2008 G.R. No. 133347 has to offer us is a complete account of how the government under former President Marcos took possession of ABS-CBN and WAS NOT AT ANY POINT BOUGHT or SOLD.
Below is the pertinent portion of that decision, for all of you to read.
Individual petitioners’ complaint-affidavits3 uniformly narrated the following facts:
1. The day after the declaration of martial law, or on September 22, 1972, just before midnight, military troops arrived at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City, and informed the officers and personnel thereat of the seizure and closure of the premises by virtue of Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1 issued by President Marcos ordering the closure of all radio and television stations in the country.
2. LOI No. 1 authorized the Secretary of National Defense to “take over or control, or cause the taking over and control of all x x x newspapers, magazines, radio and television facilities and all other media of communications” throughout the country. Consequently, a total of seven (7) television stations owned and operated by ABS-CBN were closed down by the government.4
3. When it became apparent that petitioners would not be granted a permit to re-open, ABS-CBN on October 31, 1972, terminated the services of all its employees, giving each employee his/her retirement benefits. Corollary thereto, sometime in November 1972, Eugenio Lopez, Jr., then president of ABS-CBN, wrote then Secretary of National Defense, Juan Ponce Enrile,5 of their desire to sell ABS-CBN to the government. In that same month, however, Eugenio Lopez, Jr. was arrested by the military, and detained at Fort Bonifacio for almost five (5) years until his escape therefrom on September 30, 1977.
4. Subsequently, after the proposal to sell ABS-CBN to the Marcos government did not materialize, ABS-CBN started negotiations with then Governor of Leyte, Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, who expressed his desire and intention to acquire the former. However, the negotiations with Kokoy Romualdez in 1973 likewise did not result in the sale and re-opening of ABS-CBN.
5. On June 6, 1973, the television and radio stations of Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) on Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City were consumed by fire. KBS was the umbrella corporation of the Benedicto Group of broadcasting companies, including Radio Philippines Network (RPN),6 which operated TV Channel 9, the only television station allowed to continue operating during the early years of the martial law regime. Respondent Benedicto, then Philippine Ambassador to Japan, managed, controlled, and was one of the principal stockholders of RPN.
6. On even date, both Benedicto and Alfredo Montelibano, who at that time was Chairperson of the Board of Directors (BOD) of ABS-CBN, were in Bacolod. Benedicto constituted Montelibano as his emissary to the Lopezes, relaying his plan to temporarily use ABS-CBN’s broadcast studios in Quezon City, from which to operate TV Channel 9, for such period of time as may be necessary to rebuild KBS’ burned studios.
7. On June 8, 1973, Montelibano met with other officers and executives of ABS-CBN, including herein petitioners Oscar and Augusto Lopez, informing them of Benedicto’s request. Oscar and Augusto, and the rest of the ABS-CBN management team, strongly opposed the request. Eventually, however, when Montelibano mentioned that Malacañang and Romualdez had cleared said request, the possibility of a government-ordered confiscation of ABS-CBN, and not least of all, the possible release of Eugenio Lopez, Jr., petitioners Oscar and Augusto, as with the rest of ABS-CBN’s executives, acquiesced to Benedicto’s request.
8. Thus, at noontime on the same day, representatives of KBS headed by Jose Montalvo arrived at the Meralco Building to finalize the proposed arrangement with ABS-CBN. The transaction between ABS-CBN and KBS is evidenced by a letter-agreement dated June 8, 1973, which reads in relevant part:
This is to confirm the agreement arrived at between RPN and ABS-CBN to the following effect:
1. Commencing on the date hereof, ABS-CBN hereby conveys to RPN by way of lease its TV and radio equipment (excluding TV channels and radio frequencies) and its premises at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Bohol Avenue, Quezon City (collectively called the “leased facilities”) listed in the schedule attached hereto and marked as Annex “A”.
2. RPN shall pay ABS-CBN monthly rental as is reasonable compensation for the use of the leased facilities. The amount of the rental shall be determined after a discussion with Ambassador Roberto Benedicto.
3. The term of this lease shall commence on the date hereof and continue for such reasonable time as may be normally necessary for the rehabilitation of RPN’s facilities unless an earlier period may be fixed by RPN and ABS-CBN after discussion with Ambassador Benedicto.
4. RPN hereby assumes full and complete responsibility for the leased facilities and shall be answerable for any and all losses and damages to such facilities.
x x x x
6. Upon termination of this lease, RPN shall return the possession of the leased facilities to ABS-CBN and vacate the same without the need of notice or demand.
7. ABS-CBN, through its Chairman, Mr. Alfredo Montelibano, shall have the right to select and designate the personnel (not to exceed 20 at any one time) to maintain and operate all specialized TV and radio equipment.
x x x x
10. ABS-CBN shall have the right to enter the Broadcast Center at any reasonable time during the term of this lease for the purpose of determining compliance by RPN of the terms hereof.
x x x x
12. RPN shall not, without the prior written consent of ABS-CBN, sub-lease the leased facilities or any part thereof nor shall any part be removed from the premises except the equipment, which are intended for operation the Broadcast Center in due course of operations.
9. Meanwhile, it appears that the parties were hard pressed to negotiate and fix the monthly rental rate. Several attempts by Oscar to set up a meeting with Benedicto for the fixing of the monthly rentals proved unsuccessful.
10. After more than four months of trying, a meeting between Oscar and Benedicto finally materialized on October 31, 1973. At that meeting, the discussion not only covered fixing of reasonable rentals for the lease of the ABS-CBN studios, but likewise included the possibility of an outright sale.
11. Thereafter, the discussions and negotiations stopped as none of the petitioners were able to meet anew with Benedicto who had supposedly referred the matter to “people above” and the “man on top.”
12. Frustrated, then Senator Lorenzo Tañada, as counsel for ABS-CBN, in May 1976, wrote Benedicto demanding vacation of the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center and payment of back rentals for the use of the ABS-CBN studios and facilities.
13. In response, Senator Estanislao Fernandez, on behalf of Benedicto, met with Senator Tañada in June 1976. Another meeting took place between the parties’ respective counsels which included respondent Gonzales, another counsel for Benedicto. Despite these meetings, no agreement was reached between Benedicto and ABS-CBN. On the whole, from June 8, 1973, the time KBS occupied the ABS-CBN studios in Quezon City, no rental was paid by the former to the latter.
14. In the years following until the Marcos government was toppled in 1986, the ABS-CBN stations were transferred to the National Media Production Center (NMPC) headed by Gregorio Cendaña of the Ministry of Information. Starting in January 1980, KBS, on a staggered basis, transferred possession, control and management of ABS-CBN’s provincial television stations to NMPC. Some of the radio stations of ABS-CBN were turned over to the government’s Bureau of Broadcast, while some were retained by KBS thru the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Radio Philippines Network (RPN).
15. Parenthetically, during a military inventory in 1979-1980, and a visit by ABS-CBN executives at ABS-CBN’s radio transmitting stations in Meycauayan, Bulacan, headed by petitioner Augusto, on August 13, 1984, ABS-CBN properties and massive equipment were found to be missing. In addition, the musical records and radio dramas accumulated by ABS-CBN in a span of twenty-five (25) years and stored in its library were now gone.

Do Filipino parents really want their kids participating in campus “activism”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/do-filipino-parents-really-want-their-kids-participating-in-campus-activism/,"There really is something fundamentally wrong with the way Filipino kids are being educated. We are made to believe, for example, that campus “activism” represents the pinnacle of student life, to the extent that medals are hung on students who express their “dissent” by walking out of class and participating in street rallies. Challenged as to what educational value these street rallies add to the average 17- to 21-year-old universtity student and we get subject to the shrill makabayan rhetoric peppered with notions of “revolution”, “social justice”, and other “woke” platitudes. One wonders though, how, in an age when a society’s technological prowess and innovation faculties are strong determinants of its future prosperity does the old campus “activism” spiel remain relevant.
All of the above, of course, is from the perspective of those “woke” SJWs (social justice warriors) who represent the shrillest cliques populating the political chatter in social media. It raises the question of how much value parents and taxpayers — people who actually fund the education of these students — put in their kids gaining the “activist” experience while in university. Who speaks for these parents and stakeholders in the future intelligence of today’s youth? Can their voices of reason compete with the shrieking outrage fads and calls to “dissent” issued by the armies of SJWs that infest media (both social and traditional)? It seems there is a huge injustice that demands consideration here.
If politicians are responding to what “trends” on Twitter and Facebook, then we are in real trouble. This is because those spaces are dominated by no-substance “woke” SJWs and not by the scientists and engineers who actually build stuff of enduring value. Who after all can muster enough head space to appreciate the rigour required to build a bridge when one can simply wax outrage over people dying while crossing the raging river such a bridge would have spanned. See, “activists” play into that easy space where ill-thought-out emotionalism provides enough sensational content to fill headline news. Under that light, it is easy to see why, in a system of governance such as “democracy” where popularity trumps sense, all the wrong arguments win.
Circle back from all this to the whole idea that campus “activism” is something stakeholders in the education of the youth ought to be tolerating and we gain better perspective. The simple take on all that is kids are better off attending their classes, reading their textbooks, and studying their lessons at that stage of their live than allowing themselves to be led by a bunch of terrorists to the front lines of their nebulous “revolutions”. To pitch the latter as “practical” experience is dishonest at best and criminal at worst. After all, campus “activism” is not something the average grad could proudly sport in the CV she presents to a potential employer. Boasting the number of times you pumped your fists and shouted Makibaka! while marching down Vito Cruz will not fly in an interview for a job that pays enough wages to raise a family of three.
Every university student deserves to be advised well before she decides to march off the edge and into the abyss of communist “activism” in what should be the best and most fun years of her young life. To leave “woke” SJWs and, worse, communist elements to monopolise supply of that advise is borderline criminal.
It is high time Filipino parents and taxpayers think through what kids really sign up to when taking the hand offered by communists thinly-disguised as campus “activist” organisations infesting the Philippines’ university campuses. The future of the Philippines does not lie in the false “revolutions” being invited by quaint Cold War relics. It lies in technological progress on the back of citizens’ competence in the sciences. “Activism” in the form we see today offers no pathway to get us there.",Politics
The Yellow-led Philippine Opposition are missing many opportunities to LEAD Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/the-yellow-led-philippine-opposition-are-missing-many-opportunities-to-lead-filipinos/,"Small wonder that they continue to look so lost and broken. Rather than lead, the Philippine Opposition in its current form today merely react. One can easily observe just how disturbingly reactive the Opposition are — turning their attention from one thing to another depending on what is “trending”. This sort of behaviour all the more highlights the hollowness of the Opposition rhetoric which remains anchored in counterproductive 1980s-style obstructionism and not much else. It all lays bare the lack of any compelling strategic or ideological foundation in the Opposition proposition to the Filipino public.
Over the last week three primary issues attracted Opposition buzz:
(1) The race angle of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Way before the outbreak of this new virus, the Opposition already had an axe to grind with China and its residents living in the Philippines. Opposition “thought leaders” had made criticising Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s “pivot to China” a centrepiece of their platform, citing the cozy relationship the Duterte government had fostered with China as something really bad. By the time the coronavirus crisis erupted, the Opposition were locked and loaded and ready to fire at any opportunity to demonise anything to do with China and, worse, its citizens living in the Philippines.
(2) The copy-and-paste social media “robots” that aimed to attract sympathy to the plight of Chinese nationals residing in the Philippines. Over the weekend, some “vigilant” Opposition Netizens spotted a number of social media accounts posting identical messages all over Facebook and Twitter meant to elicit sympathy for Chinese nationals. Latching onto this as “evidence” of a “troll army” employed by the Duterte administration, Opposition Netizens engaged in weekend-long chatter over this “discovery” and busied themselves making mock copy-and-paste versions of these posts and having a laugh amongst themselves.
(3) The rise-and-fall of the “OustDuterte” hashtag and the subsequent rise of the “OUSTLENI2020” hashtag. Opposition Netizens working in concert succeeded at “trending” the #OustDuterte hashtag on Twitter at the start of the weekend. This, not surprisingly, eventually waned only to be succeeded by the #OUSTLENI2020 hashtag which “trended” and garnered more than double the tweets originally amassed by the former. Opposition Netizens’ were aghast and tried their best to be dismissive of the the latter hashtag. In the process, they missed the real point — that hashtag “activism” really is a pointless exercise as social media scoring mechanisms like number of Likes and Retweets are unreliable as measures public sentiment.
The three circuses — what we call flypaper issues because of the way buzzing Netizens get stuck on these — served not only to cause more division, incite xenophobia, and waste time on inconsequential social media hashtag “activism”. Meanwhile, the more important — and more intellectually challenging — tasks of developing a vision for the Filipino people and a compelling strategic alternative to Duterte’s popular approaches to governing have fallen by the wayside. Too hard perhaps? That’s a real possibility, to be fair, seeing that the finest minds the Opposition could have mobilised to the task are such intellectual lightweights. Beyond the all-too-familiar Yellowtard call to “hit the streets”, the Opposition rhetoric remains woefully thin on substance.
Before the Opposition could hope to make things of national consequence happen, they need to reacquire power. How are they going to do that if they lack a compelling value proposition to Filipinos? Furthermore, what hope could they have of acquiring power legally if they continue to subject themselves to the leadership of lame characters like “vice president” Leni Robredo? It seems the Opposition are not at all serious about winning the next election. Perhaps it is because they had been reduced to a bunch of whiny spoilt brats by decades of being led to believe they hold a birthright to power in a democracy. Now there’s an oxymoron right there.
It is high time the Opposition aspire to be something more than the unruly mob of shrill crybabies and learn to dissent intelligently. Maybe even learning a bit of wit (in contrast to the slapstick jolog humour characteristic of their usual chatter) is in order. Maybe being a bit more innovative in their slogans is long overdue. Whatever the Opposition need to do to become relevant and compelling as a political force once again, the time for them to step up is now. After all, it takes time for an old dog to learn new tricks and time is not on the side of the Philippine Opposition considering that elections are, in the bigger scheme of things, just around the corner.",Politics
Speaker Cayetano Holds Hostage the Livelihood of Thousands of ABS-CBN Employees,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/speaker-cayetano-holds-hostage-the-livelihood-of-thousands-of-abs-cbn-employees/,"One of the House Speaker’s duties is to make sure that important political and economic legislation is passed in an efficient and timely matter.
House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano prides himself for having passed the 2020 budget in record time but not without detractors alleging that he had favored allies with hundreds of millions.
Fellow political observers looking at the behavior of some congressmen say that they saw quite remarkable changes which they say could indicate that vast sums of money changed hands.
One of which was prominent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ally Mike Defensor coming out in a prominent news article saying that House Speaker Cayetano should remain as House Speaker and renege on his term sharing agreement with congressman Lord Allan Velasco. This sticks out as an odd thing for Defensor to do, considering the hate-hate relationship Arroyo and Cayetano had.
If that’s strange, you’ll get your socks blown off when I tell you that a former government functionary says he’d even go to the extent of buying and planting kilos of illegal drugs right on the doorstep of Velasco so that he doesn’t get a chance of taking over as House Speaker.
But even as tons of cash giving people at the House of Representatives a giddy high, thousands of ABS-CBN’s employees and stakeholders have to do with weeks of restless sleep.
This is chiefly because their fate remains uncertain as the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise hasn’t been acted upon by Cayetano and the House Committee on Legislative Franchise chaired by Cong. Chicoy Alvarez.
The word I get is that not a single hearing has been called for the 10 or so resolutions for the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise filed by various other congressmen last year.
Seeing this situation, a fellow political observer said, “When it comes to shovelling millions into their pockets, Cawatano (referring to Cayetano) and his gang are blindingly fast. But when it comes to ensuring the livelihood of thousands of workers, they’re excruciatingly slow and quick to pass the buck.”
The political observer says that Cayetano and House Legislative Franchise committee chairman Alvarez keeps saying that he can’t act on the resolutions filed before his committee without a go signal from “upstairs” — referring to Malacanang.
Malacanang on the other hand says it is up to Congress to decide on ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal.
And while this buck passing happens between the House of Representatives and Malacanang, the calendar dates move onward and there are now just 17 days to go before the end of the 18th congress’ first regular session.
Another political observer speculates that Cayetano and his gang are sitting on ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal because they’re waiting for a higher money offer from the Lopezes.
Could Cayetano be such a depraved political entrepreneur that he’s willing to risk the livelihood of thousands just so he can get his hands on more money?",Politics
DICT Usec. Eliseo Rio’s Wounded Pride Used as Fodder by the Lame #OustDuterte Movement??,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/dict-usec-eliseo-rios-wounded-pride-used-as-fodder-by-the-lame-oustduterte-movement/,"The resignation of Department of Information and Communications Undersecretary Eliseo Rio Jr. was literally a log in the dark as far as I am concerned.
I was alerted to it by the calls and chat messages from my consultant friends in various government agencies and political offices.
Questions like “What the hell is Rio’s resignation really about?” interrupted my usual late night Youtube watching binge — which is, if you want to know, for the most part focused mainly on campers, van life, the SIG pistols, shotguns, ballistics, solar panels, deep cycle batteries, power management systems, and Brad Leonie who reminds me of Bill Murray.
Right off the bat, without knowing much about Usec. Rio, I told my friends “Whatever he claims is his reason for resigning, that isn’t it and if there’s anything that will fit into the anti-Duterte agenda, it will be played up.”
The timing, I pointed out, is suspect. Here we are in the midst of nCoV jitters and another Oust Duterte plot, then this happens.
By his statement alone, we would be led to believe that Rio’s resignation was born out of a sense of honor and propriety.
Granting that Rio’s Wikipedia entry’s accuracy hasn’t been compromised by sock puppets and bots, the awards and citations section of his wiki provides enough evidence of his character and competence.
But, having observed how some military and police officials behave when they are drawn into some manner of contest, the weaker party usually resorts to posteuring as a man following phrases in Hubbard’s Loyalty Pledge.
To wit:
If you must growl, condemn,
And eternally find fault,
— resign your position.
And when you are on the outside,
Damn to your heart’s content.
However, damning is something men in their prime can do. Otherwise it’s just resentful whining.
At least to me, his ANC interview published in the Manila Bulletin seemed to brim with wounded pride, spite, and resentment — which is more telling.
“I’m 75 years old, I thought that finally, to really spend more time with my family so that is the main reason for my resignation and of course the environment in DICT has changed, Sec. Honasan got in and talented young people and maybe they should be given more chance to work on…,” he added.
Rio, who also served as Acting Secretary of the Department prior Sen. Gringo Honasan’s appointment, also highlighted some of his achievements during his term in his letter, including the extension of the validity of prepaid load to one year, and the “lowering of interconnection charges to make text messages and call cheaper.”
Rio also took pride in being able to “conduct the successful bidding and award of the new major telecommunications player in the industry to complete wit the existing telecommunications duopoly in the country.”
The former DICT Acting Secretary also mentioned the following initiatives as contributors to “a significant spike in investments in the information and communications technology sector”:
Thing is, prior to former Senator Gringgo Honasan being appointed as the Secretary of the DICT, it seemed like Rio should have been the one appointed to head the organization.
On October 10, 2017, following the resignation of Rodolfo Salalima as DICT Secretary, he was appointed officer-in-charge of the department upon the instructions of President Duterte.  Rio was then elevated to acting Secretary of the department on May 8, 2018.[2] He took his oath of office at the Sandiganbayan on May 11.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliseo_Rio_Jr.
Moreover, IF EVER the Philippine government is spying on its citizens, Rio would know about it.
Rio was appointed as Undersecretary for Special Concerns of the Department of Information and Communications Technology and was sworn in on September 13, 2016.
As Undersecretary for Special Concerns, he was in charge of the formulation of policies, planning, and programming of Cybersecurity and Emergency Communications and the implementation of strategic programs and projects, and regional operations.
He also held various supervisory roles in agencies like the Cybercrime Investigation Coordination Center, the National Privacy Commission, and the COMELEC Advisory Council (CAC), as well as overseeing duties regarding the participation of the DICT in the activities of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
From Wounded Pride to Insinuating Honasan Misused Government Funds
It would be a LIE or at least not telling the whole truth if Rio says that he doesn’t know anything about the use of intelligence funds.  After all, he did formulate, plan and program the government’s Cybersecurity measures — which would be incomplete if it didn’t include monitoring and surveillance.
However, in another interview, we see Rio spill just enough beans to fuel the typical “surveillance paranoia” nurtured by leftist liberals in mainstream media.
My position is that the DICT does not need intel or confidential funds because it is not [within] its mandate to conduct intel or surveillance activities. But the position of Secretary Honasan is that this is needed by him,” Rio told GMA News Online.
Rio then argued that as Undersecretary for Operations, he should be at least informed on how these confidential expenses were used as part of  DICT operations.
“Since I am not included in the planning process of the use of this confidential funds and it’s limited only to the people Honasan brought with him, I felt left out and useless and as such, might as well to resign because I am not trusted,” Rio added.
The thing with Rio saying this AFTER CONGRESS APPROVED such a budget is WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE and UNBECOMING. He is simply not in a position to argue with the Secretary, even after resigning.
Rio’s statements in several other news articles were appended with mentions of COA issuing an Audit Observation Memorandum  on the disbursement of DICT funds as if this were a RED FLAG or equivalent to a DISALLOWANCE — WHICH IT IS NOT.
COA Circular 2009-006 (Prescribing the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts) defines an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) as “deficiencies noted in the audit of accounts, operations or transactions and requiring comments thereto and/or submission of documentary and other information requirements within a reasonable period”.
Thus, an audit observation may be regarded as preliminary. It will still be evaluated after management submits its comments and pertinent documents, and only then will an audit decision be made whether to allow or to suspend a transaction, which may ripen to disallowance
In fact an AOM could be proven by the Department or Agency as erroneous and could be corrected through a proper response — WHICH SLANTED NEWS ARTICLES DO NOT MENTION.
DICT’s Defense of Intel Funds Use
It’s funny how the Philippine communist movement’s armed and unarmed fronts voice their SHRILL opposition to the national ID system, moves to register SIM cards, the installation of citywide/nationwide CCTV systems, and other methods of legitimate surveillance.
As colorfully said by a former leftist, “Some of these hypocritical leftists and communist criminals think that a policeman patrolling the street is already an infringement of their human rights. Matingnan lang sila o mapansin ng pulis, abuso na daw. Gago!”
In anycase, the DICT officially defended its use of intel funds and from the looks of it, it seems warranted.
The DICT said the COA did not disallow the disbursements, noting that its recommendations were procedural, pertaining mainly to the timeframe for disbursement.
“Simply put, the COA’s main concern is for the department to be more efficient in processing the relevant documents — all of which the department has addressed,” it said.
Under existing laws, rules and regulations, it said the confidential expense item is for “lawful monitoring and surveillance of systems and networks to support the DICT’s functions, which include cybersecurity, the formulation and effective implementation of the National Cybersecurity Plan, and international cooperation on intelligence on cybersecurity matters.”
With cyber threats faced by the country increasing at an alarming rate, the DICT said it is mandated to protect the security of consumers and business users in ICT matters and to render technical assistance to other government agencies on related enforcement and administration.
“This increasing problem in cybersecurity needs to be addressed immediately and effectively. To do this, the expenditure of the funds, allocated as it was by Congress for that purpose, was both necessary and indispensable,” the agency said, citing reports from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky indicating that the Philippines is among countries most at risk of online infection as well as cyber attacks on the web.
According to the agency, a key component of cyber security is information gathering on ICT systems and aiding the government agencies involved in law enforcement and the defense of the country and its people.
It said cybersecurity threat monitoring activities have a direct impact on national security.
“Strategies for cybercrime and cybersecurity incident prevention are needed, together with the proper use of cyber tools, to protect our public safety and our nation’s security. The information systems in our country needs continuous monitoring so that both domestic and foreign cyber threats and cyber-attacks can be identified, addressed, and promptly neutralized to protect the safety and security of our nation,” DICT said.

Nobel + Corona + Virus: The best way to remember PNoy’s twisted legacy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/nobel-corona-virus-the-best-way-to-remember-pnoys-twisted-legacy/,"January 25 is a day that’s indelibly seared like that by a branding iron into the brain of former President Noynoy/Pnoy Aquino. It was the special day of his mother Cory (born on Jan 25, 1933) who then passed away at just the right moment in time for him to be catapulted via Yellow necro-political playbook to the much-coveted national throne. It was also the day (Jan 25, 2015) PNoy sent the SAF44 to their fateful end, which then eventually sealed the complete downfall of his Yellow empire.
The Dilawans will always remind us in anti-ML rallies to “Never Forget”; thus we should apply their admonition circumspectly. Let us also never forget the twisted legacy of arguably the most incompetent and most self-indulgent presidency that ever graced the Philippine political arena.
How better can we be reminded of the “accomplishments” of the past regime than with a convenient acronym that is all over the news these days: nCoV!!! ?
n – for Nobel Prize recipient wannabe. PNoy was probably so addicted to his grand delusion of someday winning the Nobel Peace prize for being the leader who “ended the decades long Muslim insurgency in the South”, that he was willing to sacrifice 44 of the country’s finest commandos for his dream. He would not lift a finger to even send out rescue reinforcements to the embattled heroes that day in Mamasapano – so he just waited it out while his key officers listened to the pleas and calls for help – to no avail, till … radio silence.
Co – for CJ Corona. Gloria-appointed Chief Justice Renato Corona found himself at the center of Pnoy’s rabid all-out-war and relentless campaign to oust the man behind the Cojuangco’s prized Hacienda Luisita being given back to the farmers who tilled the land. For this noble act leading to their family wealth being torn from them, PNoy was probably so fuming enraged at CJ Corona he was willing to move heaven and earth just to impeach the poor guy. Massive illegal DAP/PDAF pork barrel funds were showered upon Senators to bribe them into submission on handing down that “inaccurate SALN” guilty verdict. It was akin to sending to death row a man caught jaywalking.
V – for the yellow Virus behind the contagion/epidemic that swept the country for 3 long decades, earning us the moniker “Sick Man of Asia.” This virus gave those who got infected severe symptoms of incompetence, anti-intellectualism, leadership devoid of vision/strategy, and self-serving politics in the guise of “public welfare for the masses.” Viral as it was upon Cory’s rise to power through EDSA’s PPR, it was all a sham, hollow, hypocrisy-infested political movement. The type that will support the establishment of the CPP-NPA insurgency just to bring down a strongman. But finally, PNoy’s incompetent and lazy governance showed the true color of this damaging virus – that of puke-inducing crap, phlegm, and pus. Through the last Yellow prince, Filipinos have now snapped out of the spell. Salamat PNoy! .. sa kalayaan mula sa kadilawan.
The utter disgrace of the Otso Deretso Yellow-turned-White Senatorial slate in the recent national elections is solid evidence Filipinos have had enough of this shameless PNoy brand of leadership. It is a legacy marked by failure upon failure upon failure, followed by guess what … even more “pasagasa pa kami sa tren” FAILURE: Luneta Chinese tourist bus hostage crisis/tragedy, Haiyan/Yolanda relief debacle, LRT/MRT breakdown, Dengvaxia vaccine fiasco, unconstitutional DAP/PDAF scam, loss of SCS islets to China, drug dens/command centers in Muntinlupa prison, and most of all the fall of SAF44.
The last tragedy was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Let us hope we will never again have to suffer under the hands of such reckless incompetence, treachery and self-interest in our national leadership. One of his greatest legacies is adding a new word to the Dictionary: “Noynoying.”
After 5 years with not even a single-day prison term in sight for the homicidal ex-president, an article such as this is probably all the justice the SAF44’s loved ones will ever get for the loss of their gallant heroes who paid the ultimate sacrifice simply because Ninoy (your smiling P500-bill traitor) once said… the Filipino (i.e., his quintessentially Yellow son PNoy) is worth dying for.",Politics
"In times of crisis, the Yellow-led Philippine Opposition sows fear instead of promoting unity",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/in-times-of-crisis-the-yellow-led-philippine-opposition-sows-fear-instead-of-promoting-unity/,"The Philippine Opposition has so far failed to step up to contribute to the national effort to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Rather than propose solutions, they merely undermine government efforts to get on top of the situation. This is certainly something that will not go down well with Filipino voters considering the next national elections are just around the corner. Rather than consolidate their efforts into a coherent force, the Opposition remain a disorganised lot of rabblerousers who do nothing better than take lame potshots at the incumbent.
Led by the a bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards), the Opposition engage in rhetoric with an intent to demonise Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and discredit efforts being taken by his government to manage the situation. They even suggest that Duterte let his “vice president” Leni Robredo “lead” the Filipino people instead!
If you cannot lead, give it to VP Leni. https://t.co/QhGWSuAsVl

There is no merit in proposing a disruption to governance, specially at a time when the need for Filipinos to work together is of the utmost importance. Then again, disrupting governance is something the Yellowtards specialise in. Rather than work within the frame of the law to push change, the preferred operating model of the Yellowtards is to rouse mass action in the hope of inciting another “people power revolution” reminiscent of the ones that eruped in 1986 and in 2001 that resulted in the ouster of the late former President Ferdinand Marcos and former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada respectively.
It is easy for top Yellowtard “thought leaders” to make sweeping statements that suggest that anyone other than the duly-elected current president can do a better job. Harvey Keh who, at one time, was “Director for Youth Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship, Ateneo de Manila University’s School of Government” issued the following tweet…
The government’s current handling of the COVID-19 should give us all the more reason to make sure we elect the right President and leaders in the 2022 elections. Literally, our lives and the lives of our love ones depend on it. You can start by making sure you register to vote.
One wonders though what bases Keh applies to his thinking that an Opposition president would handle the crisis better. Last time a Yellowtard president was in office, he botched a hostage situation in Manila, a police commando operation in Mamasapano, and a supertyphoon disaster in Tacloban all of which resulted in enormous death tolls of tragic proportions.
Even more baffling is the fact that the Opposition is still to find a strong leader capable of uniting their different tribal units into a force capable of challenging the hugely popular Duterte. For now, all they have to show for their trouble is their “vice president” Leni Robredo who, beyond mirroring the Yellowtards’ penchant for melodramatic virtue signalling, exhibits neither the character nor the statesmanship to rally a nation of more than 100 million towards a compelling national vision.
On that last point, does the Yellowtard-led Philippine Opposition have a national vision to begin with?
That’s a question that could launch a thousand debates. But therein lies the more important point. The Opposition, as the campaign begins for the 2022 elections is hopelessly fragemented and being pulled in a thousand different directions. In contrast, the Duterte administration remains resolute, singularly focused, and consistent with its 2016 campaign rhetoric. Small wonder that this government continues to enjoy approval ratings that dwarf whatever semblance of public goodwill the entire Opposition community could muster.
Seriously. Unfit. For. Office.

Whatever any garden-variety Yellowtard may say — or tweet — the bottomline is whether those words or actions (if any) can translate to converted voters. That’s a tough challenge to face when you are a community of partisans who squandered every ounce of the vast political capital you enjoyed at the close of the 1980s and, in the six years of the Second Aquino Presidency, lost the trust of an entire nation.
The only way forward for the Opposition is to apply a bit of humility to the challenge ahead and learn. The lessons are obvious and the solutions even more so. The first thing they need to do is re-evaluate all the negative campaigning they engage in and ask themselves: Do these actually deliver results? Granted, there may be a lot about the current government to criticise, the Opposition are evidently not building political capital doing what they are doing today. Indeed, there is even a lot to learn from people they summarily dismiss as “trolls”.
In short, the Opposition must learn to be more inclusive in their approach and ditch the pompous high-nosed exclusive airs in the way they conduct themselves today. The Philippines, after all, is a vast and diverse country — certainly one not fully-represented within the chi chi grounds of Diliman and Loyola Heights. Neither do most Filipinos care about high-fallutin’ Western notions of “human rights” and “gender equality”. All Filipinos really need is clarity of vision and purposefulness in action. This requires that we as a people focus on the future and cure ourselves of our fixation on an increasingly irrelevant past. The Opposition need to take heed and build upon that foundation for the sake of their future electoral success.",Politics
Stopping ABS-CBN’s Franchise Renewal By Hook and By Crook,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/stopping-abs-cbns-franchise-renewal-by-hook-and-by-crook/,"This morning Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the franchises of ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc “as they are unlawfully exercising their legislative franchises.”
It would look like the final nail in the coffin of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal. That is if we consider that a number of cases lodged in the Supreme Court were decided in favor of Duterte’s allies and against his enemies.
Ordinarily, ABS-CBN would have 30 days in which to respond to the quo warranto position but, according to a reporter at the Supreme Court, this period may be shortened.
This is because it may be overtaken by the recess of Congress which happens in about two weeks and without bill renewing ABS-CBN’s franchise passing the Third and Final reading, this will spell the end for the broadcast network’s operations.
So far,  11 bills seeking ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal have yet to be calendared. Attempts to renew ABS-CBN’s franchise were similarly stalled in previous sessions of congress.
A copy of Calida’s quo warranto could not be obtained immediately by reporters at the scene of the filing of the petition. Attempts by reporters to interview Calida on the basis of the quo warranto petition were refused with the solicitor general saying that he was headed to another appointment. He however had time enough to rebuff one male reporter, accusing him of hitting him and told him that “you better just practice (law) so we can see each other in court.”
However, in what appears to be a statement issued by Solicitor General Calida published by Facebook page Bulatlat, it was said that the quo warranto petition filed sought to “…put an end to what we discovered to be highly abusive practices of ABS-CBN benefitting a greedy few at the expense of millions of loyal subscribers. These practices have gone unnoticed or were disregarded for years,”
Further on in the statement it is claimed that “…petition will show that ABS-CBN has been broadcasting for a fee, which is beyond the scope of its legislative franchise. Further, the media giant, hiding behind an ‘elaborately crafted corporate veil’ has been allowing foreign investors to take part in the ownership of a Philippine mass media entity, in gross violation of the foreign interest restriction of mass media provided under Section 11, Article XVI of the Constitution.
“ABS-CBN abused the privilege granted by the State when it launched and operated a pay-per-view channel in ABS-CBN TV Plus, the KBO Channel, without prior approval or permit from the National Telecommunications Commission.”
“Further, like Rappler, ABS-CBN had issued Philippine Deposit Receipts (PDRs) through ABS-CBN Holdings Corporations to foreigners, in violation of the foreign ownership restriction on mass media in the Constitution.”
Near the end of the statement it was said, “ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc (formerly Multi Media Telepony Inc) resorted to an ingenious corporate layering scheme in order to transfer its franchise without the necessary Congressional approval. It also failed to publicly offer any of its outstanding capital stock to any securities exchange within the Philippines within five years from the start of its operations, which is an indispensable condition in its franchise.”
In an interview on ANC, Congressman Rufus Rodriguez characterized Solicitor General’s petition as a direct assault to the freedom of the press and violated the equality as well as independence of the branches of government.
Rodriguez asserted that challenges to ABS-CBN’s franchise should be heard in Congress because it is the only branch of government given specific charge over the granting of franchises. He said he believes that the Supreme Court will deny the Solicitor General’s petition.
Rodriguez called on the leadership of the House of Representatives to start hearings on the bills filed in the Committee on Legislative Franchises and ASSERT its independence from the Executive branch of government.
All in all, it doesn’t look like ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal was NEVER going to be given a fair shot.",Politics
IBON Foundation “red-tagging” complaint will fly only if they can CATEGORICALLY DENY links to the Communist Party,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/ibon-foundation-red-tagging-complaint-will-fly-only-if-they-can-categorically-deny-links-to-the-communist-party/,"News has now gotten around that communist front IBON Foundation filed an administrative complaint against Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy among others. IBON Foundation reportedly claim that Badoy engaged in “red tagging”. Presumably, the complaint draws partly from a video showing Badoy allegedly “hijacking” the agenda of a talk show that included IBON Research Head Rosario Guzman.
A statement released by IBON Foundation on the 30th January following the incident condemned Badoy for “linking IBON to the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front of the Philippines (CPP-NPA-NDFP)” consistent to what was observed in the video. But while the statement described this so-called “red-baiting” as “disinformation”, nowhere in the statement does IBON categorically deny Badoy’s allegations — that they as well as other “progressive” organisations are really just “legal” fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Indeed, the closest the IBON statement gets to some semblance of a counterargument against the “red-tagging” charge is this…
IBON has been explaining economic issues to the public for 41 years. The Duterte administration is attacking IBON because we advocate an economy that upholds the people’s interests most of all. As with activists and other groups, we are undeterred and will continue to support the efforts of the people’s movement to reclaim the economy from the elites that have taken it over.
In short, IBON not only cannot deny their alleged links to the Communist Party of the Philippines, they cannot even assert that Badoy is making a false claim about those links.
If you examine the statement closely, what IBON does suggest is that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is against building “an economy that upholds the people’s interests” and is, as such “attacking IBON”. It seems it is IBON, in this instance, that is making an unfounded assertion. They will need to prove that the Duterte administration is implementing an economic policy that runs counter to the interests of the Filipino people to clear the air around this so they could move forward with their complaint against Badoy (if said complaint holds water, that is).
It is interesting how the current Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders. A Stanford University report on militant organisations, for example, describes current party-list group Bayan Muna, a key stakeholder in the IBON Foundation, as “a political party connected to the CPP and other groups in the Communist movement.”
According to a recent ABS-CBN News report Bayan Muna is part of the Makaybayan bloc of left-leaning party-lists that include “Gabriela, Kabataan, Anakpawis, Migrante, and Alliance of Concerned Teachers.” Like most other mainstream reports and discussion surrounding these “leftist” organisations, the report stops short of describing these groups as being linked to the CPP and the terrorist NPA.
It just takes just a little bit of research or observation over readily accessible sources like social media and even old news reports to see that familiar names, organisations, and slogans are common across all the militant groups mentioned thus far. Bayan Muna and IBON Foundation, in fact, often get mentioned in the same paragraph in many such news reports. Dig a bit deeper and you will find the personalities who lead or are, at least, involved with these groups sharing the same social networks.
The short of it is, these groups insult the intelligence of Filipinos by continuing to pretend that they are not communists. If IBON Foundation and other communist front organisation are to be taken seriously about their whining about being “red-tagged”, perhaps they need to reflect on their own banal dishonesty first and, following that, get real and start making more truthful statements about themselves, their activities, and their true intentions.",Politics
Philippine “President” Leni Robredo in a time of pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/philippine-president-leni-robredo-in-a-time-of-pandemic/,"As the COVID-19 pandemic plays out globally, the main drive of the Philippine Oppositions is not to help Filipinos deal with the crisis together. Rather, their goal is to prove that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is not fit to lead his people through it. This is consistent with their singular objective — to seize power and re-establish the status quo that has been their comfort zone for several decades. With no credible Opposition leader charismatic enough to go up against the massively-popular incumbent, it has fallen on “vice president” Leni Robredo to be Opposition “leader” by sheer default.
The Opposition, led by the bloc within it rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards), is essentially destructive in nature and the way their members conduct themselves clearly damages the social fabric of a people already frayed by crisis upon crisis. However, it is fair to say that a scenario in which Duterte steps down as president and, as mandated by law, Robredo steps up (assuming her claim to the vice presidency is legitimate) to take office as President of the Philippines needs to be explored. What would Robredo do differently to Duterte?
So far, Robredo has played backseat driver over the course of several crises including this most recent one. As a backseat driver, it is easy to come across as knowledgeable and authoritative. Thus it really isn’t that baffling the way Opposition partisans have lapped up every one of her motherhood statements. Among the things she has “urged” President Duterte to do includes identifying funds to acquire testing kits and to “procure these test kits as soon as possible”. Robredo also encouraged the government to observe how the disease is spreading in Italy and Iran which, together, account for the most COVID-19 infection cases and deaths and learn what they “do wrong”. She also reportedly expressed an interest in “best practices” and said that the Philippines ought to “learn from the experiences of other countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan”.
This is all well and good. The Opposition has so far run with sound bytes such as those. Their main argument is to show that Robredo says stuff like that and Duterte doesn’t. But does what one person say and the other doesn’t and vice versa prove one is better than the other? It seems that the Opposition have hinged their entire obstructionist platform on Robredo’s words and Duterte’s alleged lack of counterpart statements. In this sense, the Opposition are being grossly unfair to the various government agencies staffed by professionals working together to manage the crisis and mitigate the risks of it worsening. They are suggesting that government agencies and their staff are doing a bad job — not sourcing test kits and observing “best practice”, for example — just because Duterte did not mention such initiatives in his public statements. They then go on to imply that such measures will be done better if Robredo was president.
Such a position to take is nothing short of insulting to a professional civil service. The Opposition would like Filipinos to believe that the performance and quality of work of their civil servants are directly determined by who is president and not by their professional ethic and initiative.
This gives us a hint of what a Robredo presidency would be like. It would be a selfie presidency of grandstanding and prayerful emotional blackmail. This is consistent with how Robredo behaved when she “helped” in the relief effort during the Taal Volcano eruption (one the Opposition were quick to call a “tragedy”) just a few months back. Rather than be a quiet achiever at the time, Robredo made it a point to make her involvement in the relief effort all about herself.
What could be potentially dangerous about a Robredo presidency is the fact that the small handful of Big Corporate Media organisations that monopolise “news reporting” and “fact checking” in the Philippines back her and the Yellowtard brand of emo politics. They selectively “report” the news, and “investigate” the “facts” in a manner slanted to subliminal political messages dictated by the golf buddies of their owners and top shareholders. The incestuous relationship the Philippines’ media moguls enjoy with powerful politicians was laid bare recently when Senator Grace Poe used the Senate as a prop to highlight the “plight” of media behemoth ABS-CBN before an enormous TV and social media audience. Unfortunately for Poe, the inherent conflicts-of-interest of this stunt on account of her and her family’s financial interests in ABS-CBN did not escape the scrutiny of vigilant Filipinos. A Robredo presidency will likely be no different — one upon whose coattails an erstwhile disenfranchised Yellowtard community can ride on with the benefit of billion-peso corporate media channels serving as cheerleaders.
The fact is, being president is not all about one’s self. This is something Leni Robredo needs to learn and take to heart if she is to lead Filipinos as their president. Being president is being a leader to all Filipinos and not just her party and certainly not just to her sponsors in the oligarchy. Duterte has so far exhibited unprecedented resilience — sustaining wide public approval and trust despite an army of Opposition “thought leaders”, an entire “news” media industry, and the communist-infested student bodies of the country’s chichiest universities sustaining a massive demonisation campaign against him in concert. In that light, it is easy to see what a sad pale shadow of Duterte’s government one run by Robredo would be. Filipinos need to think twice about even considering a Leni Robredo presidency specially in these interesting times. More importantly, the broader Opposition should seriously re-think the idea of being “led” by the Yellowtards — for their sake.",Politics
ABS-CBN Tax Evasion is Fake News,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/abs-cbn-tax-evasion-is-fake-news/,"With only a couple of weeks before ABS-CBN(s legislative franchise expires, there seems to be a mad scramble.
I am not too sure whether it is to hammer the final nail in its coffin or to beat the dead horse.
Either way, there is a mob calling for its closure that seems louder and more violent than the voices of reason.
In the madness, people are bound to lose sight of facts and that seems to be the very idea driving the online cacophony.
One fact is that ABS-CBN claims it does not have any outstanding tax liability.
I’ve been seeing this accusation against ABS-CBN all over Facebook and it doesn’t make a bit of sense.
If it were true, I suppose we would have seen BIR file a case of tax evasion against ABS-CBN, but here doesn’t seem to be a case.
President Rodrigo Duterte has said that he wants ABS-CBN shutdown, but I doubt he has said it is because of tax evasion.
So where is this tax evasion accusation coming from?
Any how, I guess we will never know or ever get to find out how this ever came about.
Apart from this, another strange thing I noticed was Mocha Uson Blog and MindaVote calling Senator Pimentel a traitor for asking the House of Representatives to do its job and act on bills calling for ABS-CBN’s renewal.
That’s the sort of language and logic that betrays what kind of intellect is driving the discussion.
In the words of a political party stalwart, “Bobo!”
ABS-CBN has a right to due process which the House of Representatives is denying through its failure to act on the 11 bills filed for the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise.
If Pimentel is a traitor for calling out the House of Representatives on its inaction, then perhaps House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano can be regarded our country’s highest patriot for not doing his job.",Politics
Panic over COVID-19 being kicked up by the Yellowtards is starting to wear thin,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/panic-over-covid-19-being-kicked-up-by-the-yellowtards-is-starting-to-wear-thin/,"The panic being kicked up around the coronavirus outbreak is beginning to get tiresome. Unfortunately for Filipinos, the COVID-19 scare is the latest weaponised outrage fad the Yellowtard-led Opposition is clinging onto to bolster their demonisation campaign against the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
While other societies unite to fight the spread of this disease, the Yellowtards are fomenting division. Key to their obsession with COVID-19 is the convenient fact that it originated from China. This fits their narrative to a tee — their hollow criticism of Duterte’s pivot to China and what they assert is his plan to turn the Philippines into a “province of China”.
This is not to dismiss, of course, the disturbing influx of Chinese elements into the Philippines and their emerging effects — some good, some bad — on Philippine society. However, the Yellowtards need to take a more intelligent perspective on their bashing of Duterte and ethnic Chinese people. They need to regard the issues without the partisan blinkers that stunt their thinking.
While the Yellowtards shriek about the spread of COVID-19, they seem to conveniently turn a blind eye to far more deadly and more known social diseases that kill and permanently injure far more Filipinos. The jeepney, for example, is a persistent social cancer that kills and maims far more Filipinos than COVID-19 ever will. These primitive contraptions also indirectly impact the lives of millions more thanks to the poisonous fumes they emit and the enormous traffic jams they cause. Interestingly enough, Filipinos are in a far better position to solve their jeepney problem than they are of getting a grip over biological threats. Jeepneys are, after all, a socio-political issue while biological threats demand more scientific and technological responses. Between the earlier and the latter, it is evident which of the two Filipinos excel at (or at least have louder voices to bring to bear).
Jeepneys are just one example of many problems dishonestly ignored by Yellowtard “activists” because these do not fit their dishonest political agenda. But in just that one example, the impact on Filipino lives utterly DWARFS that of what the COVID-19 outbreak would cause. Just last month, a jeepney was shown on a video running over a group of kids crossing a street. Yet no shrill expressions of outrage came from the Opposition cliques nor any calls for Duterte’s head over the continued proliferation of these killer vehicles heard.
Other diseases endemic to tropical settings seem to also escape the reach of outrage fad “activism” at the level of shrillness the COVID-19 crisis attracts. To put the numbers in perspective, almost 6,000 cases of Dengue and 22 deaths related to it were reported from January to February of this year just in the Central Visayas alone.
The Yellowtards are, indeed, a dishonest bunch of snowflake virtue signallers that have no place in a country that aspires to be a modern and mature democracy. They go as far as undermining statements released by Philippine government authorities and direct their followers to unofficial channels. For example, they are quick to flock to the statements on the matter of “vice president” Leni Robredo simply because she is perceived to be one of them.

This is a dangerous thing to be doing during a period of global crisis. Robredo, for one, has a history of making statements that damage the interests of the state such as when she told lies upon lies in a video exhibited to a United Nations forum in 2017. More recently, Robredo also pretended to be “helping” with relief operations in the aftermath of the Taal Volcano eruption when, in fact, she spent most of her time putting up a performance before the cameras to score PR points.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious matter of global consequence that demands a national response in collaboration with the global effort. This is no time for the petty divisive partisanism being exhibited by the Yellowtard-led Philippine Opposition. The crisis should not be used as a means to score political points. Indeed, with national elections just around the corner, the shrill voices emanating from the Opposition should be regarded with a critical mind. Desperation, after all, makes for ill-thought-out and misguided posturing. It’s time Filipinos see past that and seek real solutions by applying modern thinking to the challenges they face.",Politics
"In the time of COVID-19 pandemic, Duterte actually knows how to talk to his people",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/in-the-time-of-covid-19-pandemic-duterte-actually-knows-how-to-talk-to-his-people/,"Ironic that Inquirer columnist Vincen Gregory Yu (was his name mis-spelt or is that really his name?), in his quaint expression of Singapore envy today, would issue the following lament in wistful observation of how well that country’s Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, briefed his people on how his government was managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic…
How nice to have a government—or even just a head of state—that actually knows how to talk to its people, instead of sending them into alternating states of panic and paranoia.
It’s hard, of course, to disagree with this. In times of crises, clarity and coherence of messaging from people of authority is of the essence. However, it is worth noting how Yu qualifies this observation by describing Lee as “a head of state—that actually knows how to talk to its people”.
Very interesting indeed. If Yu’s intent was to paint Lee in stark contrast to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, he definitely succeeded. But what he had inadvertently highlighted is just how much of a reflection of the Filipino character this brings to the fore. Continuing down this road he takes, Yu goes on to cite Duterte’s conduct when he addressed the nation on the same day.
He was two hours late to the scheduled broadcast, and when he finally appeared, it was to announce—in increments—the provisions of the Metro Manila quarantine. “Announce now, details to follow” was the gist of the whole affair, as if the document he was reading were the most banal and unimportant thing.
Perhaps so.
Thing is, the inescapable reality of the Duterte government is that it remains an overwhelmingly popular one. This means that Duterte is doing something right — right enough to win an election in 2016 and continuing doing that something right to attract a sustained approval of his people three years into his term. And what is one of those things he may be doing right? Wait for it… perhaps he actually knows how to talk to his people.
In his Inquirer article “President Duterte’s style of speaking”, Professor Randy David describes Duterte’s style of addressing his people as one that, “unlike other politicians”, is “easy to understand”.
[Filipinos] rarely need to guess what he’s saying. He speaks his mind out, and offers no excuses for doing so.
He doesn’t appear to care if what he says is morally offensive or contrary to law. People may disagree with what he’s saying or feel uncomfortable with his crude utterances. But, on the whole, they seem to approve of his brutal candor.
David adds, “In this, I believe, lies his power to enchant audiences. Authentic is when he sets aside a speech written for him, and then proceeds to so say what he ‘really’ wants to say.” In that sense, David is saying that Duterte “knows how to talk to his people” in much the same way that Yu asserts Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong does.
Say what you must about what that says about Filipinos but it is what it is. It’s what won Duterte the privilege to serve Filipinos as their President and it is what enables him to sustain his popularity. Duterte is able to connect with Filipinos because he knows how to talk to them.
And what of his being “two hours late to the scheduled broadcast” as Yu points out? That’s an easy one. In that respect Duterte too is being in tune with Filipinos by being on Filipino time. He’s not only speaking in their language, he is also in sync with their operating rhythm. Hardly surprising that Filipinos don’t have an issue with that either.
This is the whole trouble with the way Duterte’s critics seek to undermine his presidency and, they hope, reclaim what they believe is their entitlement to political power in the Philippines. They think by putting him under a spotlight filtered by their chi chi private Catholic schooling that they could present him in a way the Filipino masses would find distasteful. When will they learn that this approach quite simply does not work?
What the Opposition needs to focus on is how to become more popular than Duterte. It’s the only way they can hope to win an election which, last we heard, is the only way to acquire political power under a democracy. This is different from the loser strategy of trying to tear Duterte down before his people — one that resulted in the Opposition’s catastrophic loss in last year’s national elections. The Opposition need only learn this obvious lesson if they are truly serious about seeing their political fortunes change. They need to present themselves and their ideas as better alternatives to Duterte.",Politics
The dishonest intent in Leni Robredo’s “free shuttle services” to Filipinos in a time of COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/the-dishonest-intent-in-leni-robredos-free-shuttle-services-to-filipinos-in-a-time-of-covid-19-pandemic/,"Every bit of resource thrown into the effort to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is welcome, not the least the “free shuttle services” being deployed by “vice president” Leni Robredo through her office. However, a very important question needs to be asked: Why does Leni Robredo’s name and that of her office need to be prominently-displayed on tarps fastened to these shuttle vehicles? What utility does the information in those tarps serve the public?
Consider for a moment the perspective of the average Filipino commuter. All a public transport patron really needs to know about a public transport vehicle is where it is going and, perhaps, that the service is free. Any information beyond that is nothing but noise.
A basic principle of communication engineering is maximising signal-to-noise ratio in a channel. In the case of a typical public utility vehicle (PUV), the signal is the route information and the noise is all the rest of the decals adorning the vehicle. In much the same way many public buses allow some space to display advertising on its exteriors, one can argue that those tarps signalling Robredo’s “caring” to the public constitute a form of advertising. This raises the question:
What is “vice president” Leni Robredo advertising?
People are likely to be able to work out the answer to that question on their own. The point is, the tarps clearly don’t serve any purpose other than whatever interests Robredo seeks to advertise. Robredo says she want to contribute. Everyone is happy that she does. The difference is, many who do do so quietly. Robredo’s intent in having those tarps adorning her buses is to do so noisily.
If Robredo’s office were sincere about the public service they are delivering, it should be reflected in the way they inform the public about said service. And a key principle in the information business is to not over-inform and minimise noise to enhance the signal. Even with the best of intentions, we do tend to over-inform — providing more information than is needed to get the job done. In this case, those tarps adorning Robredo’s shuttle services clearly do not represent any best intentions — only insidious ones.
In times of crises, citizens need to look to a unified government that is in solidarity with their needs. Dividing government services into brands and cults of personality runs counter to this. There is no value to ordinary people in differentiating government services between one politician or the other. What Filipinos need are government services, PERIOD. They just need to know what that service delivers. In the case of public transport, people just need to know where the damn bus is going before they board it!",Politics
"Land of the Yellowtards, Redtards, Whitetards and Bluetards",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/land-of-the-yellowtards-redtards-whitetards-and-bluetards/,"Welcome to the land of retards on this side of the Pacific, where just about every flavor and color abounds. That marketing tagline “more fun in the Philippines” actually involves the sheer delight of surviving and navigating the jungle of various forms of “schewfidity” that have infected mass groups of gullible people like a pandemic-causing virus.
You may have noticed those are the colors of the Philippine flag up there in the title, and it’s not just coincidental that each color represents a form of Tardism that has uniquely blossomed in the country; it was probably some self-fulfilling destiny that got the national colors to match the current demography of major misguided groups (composed of activists, thought leaders, influencers, followers, and apologists) that make up the Philippines.
In this article, we will not be covering the Greentards (those overly occupied with calculating Carbon footprints and defending whale rights) or what the anti-government camp calls the “Dutertards” (a.k.a. DDS) who need no introduction these days. Instead we will feature four mainstream groups that are fixated on their own little fairy land fantasies and illusions of grandeur.
Yellowtards – Those who got duped by the farce yellow EDSA revolution of Cory (who may have even given the go signal for her own husband’s assassination), which only led the nation into the dismal 3-decade descent into a cultural abyss of anti-intellectualism, malfunctional chaos and freedom for freedom’s sake (never mind the “run like hell” wish by MLQ). To be worshiped as heroes while protecting The Hacienda was the end goal, which now haunts the Filipino whenever they use their P500 bills or pass through the main international gateway (NAIA) – as a quick subliminal reminder to Never Forget to vote for an Aquino in the next elections.
Redtards – Those who are behind the Philippines being host to Asia’s longest running communist insurgency – thanks to ka Joma Sison who enjoys the luxury of first-world amenities in the Netherlands while his band of fanatical terrorists (the “nothing new” NPA) and obsolete-minded democratic-kuno activist fronts wreak havoc across the land for just about any word that contains “FREE” or “RIGHTS”. They are addicted to revolution, and only really find meaning for existence if an authoritarian figure exists. Painting the government (regardless of who becomes President) as “capitalista, tuta ng America, diktatura”, these are people who after being generously granted free education will use what was invested on them to bring about the downfall of their benevolent motherland.
Whitetards – These are hypocritical religious leaders of the Padre Damaso type. Best represented today by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, these are men who dress themselves white (like a band of Klu Klux Klan supremacists atop their high horses) to sanctimoniously portray their holiness/righteousness externally while they amass wealth (tax free) and use their influence on sheeple to advance the agendas of corporations and political entities they lie in bed with. Vowing celibacy for life, they turn their base human urges toward young lads and romance-deprived nuns and hardly say anything against the abnormally disgusting act of man-to-man copulation clearly condemned in their sacred writings. The hypocrisy is especially glaring when they love to be called “Father” despite their holy scripture’s clear command not to seek titles and honorifics:
“They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues. they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.” -Matt.23
Finally the Tardism matrix is not complete without this final group:
Bluetards – Never heard? Let’s start with the online-available definition, by Urban dictionary:
A person who is constantly wearing a bluetooth headset in an effort to appear important regardless of setting and or social standing. This person is also oblivious to the fact that they look like a complete douche.
Note: Bluetooth is a technology meant to replace cables of arms-length distance; in contrast with RFID (for eliminating plugging / electrical contact for identification) and Wifi (for eliminating LAN cables for inter-device communication in an office/room).
But a broader way to define bluetards would be through “blue blood” – in reference to aristocrats, and privileged, noble families that are wealthy and powerful, based on the medieval European concept that those of royalty and nobility had blue blood running through their veins.
Bluetards are mainly the elite, powerful, and super rich. They also include the nouveau rich/famous and self-made multi-millionaires of this generation. Then last and least – they include elitist wannabes, humming the tune of “I did my best, but I guess my best wasn’t good enough” while covering up the reality of their pitiful bank accounts with a Louis Vuitton or Prada bag over one’s shoulder. They come in the form of politicians, actors/actresses, athletes, and businessmen who think they are above the rest and assume the rules don’t apply to them because they have a convoy with sirens.
When asked to fall in line like everyone else, they bite back with “Alam mo ba kung sino ako?” or “Hoy, Tatay ko ko kaya si …” Recall Elvis Presley’s hit song “Blue suede shoes”? Don’t you ever step on a bluetard’s ego or cross his path unless you’re willing to be blown off to kingdom come.
The bluetards enjoy living in the Philippines (rather than migrating abroad) because the environment is conducive for fanning one’s ego and being worshiped by fans and followers. They can insulate themselves from the suffering that happens all around them by living in their own exclusive world, the way business or first class on a flight is availed by those who can afford it. Bluetards like making a scene so they can be on front page or prime-time evening news. They take pride in arriving with style on a big black imported SUV when they don’t even have the home-grown tech to make even basic bolts and nuts used to build them.
Should the Philippines have a Royal Family?
This question is being dished out as a thought experiment for the general public to ponder on. Will it only feed the pride and aristocratic mindset of the elite as well as the prevalence of the starstruck ignoramus syndrome? Or will a royal family like those in England and Imperial Japan serve to unite a fragmented nation? Should the royal family be elected every several years like typical politicians? If so, should they be chosen from among the current reigning rich and beautiful celebrities?
The bluetards have been around for so long, we just haven’t called them out as they grew rich and richer because we were too focused on the other tards. If they want so much attention and importance ascribed to them, then here’s the introductory article that officially grants them a place in the crowded Tard landscape of the Philippines.
The Parable of the Ipis Colony and the Pepsi Bottle
An empty Pepsi bottle stood beside a dirt road in an African wildlife preserve, which had residue saliva still sticking on the bottle’s mouth. A nearby Ipis colony easily discovered it and like a bunch of fanatical die-hard egomaniacs all tried to scramble up to the top to win the prize – the glory and honor of getting to lick up those lusciously sweet saliva molecules. As soon as one Ipis got there, another Ipis would knock it off. A few in the struggle fell into the bottle and died. It was chaos like crazy to win the golden opportunity to stand on the pedestal. It meant all the world to these individual Ipis to be on “top of the world”, to the envy of everyone else in the colony.
Meanwhile enormous beasts – elephants, rhinos, and buffalos, just passed by hardly noticing all the action taking place on that abandoned Pepsi bottle. One young elephant asked its gigantic Mama what that bottle covered with Ipis was all about. The Mama admonished the inquisitive calf, “The Ipis think small and believe they are achieving something of great importance the entire world will look up to and applaud, when in fact nobody in the real world really cares. One of these days, someone in the herd will accidentally step on those pathetic creatures and nobody will even shed a tear. Let them mind their own business.”
And the Ipis Colony went about their mysterious insignificant business oblivious of the fact there was a much bigger world out there, up until the inevitable event happened – Squish!",Politics

Besides what greater honor is there for a Filipino than to have his/her face and name immortalized on the basic unit of commerce/trade? The fact that every day, millions of bills and coins are exchanged between hands throughout the country makes getting into this elite circle of featured faces and names something that’s highly coveted, giving one a place among the few “heroes”, “stars” and “noble men and women” who have made an indelible mark on Philippine history.
Emilio Aguinaldo is a controversial character in Philippine history; among the shadiest acts ascribed to him include the execution of the founder of the Philippine revolution himself, the Supremo – Andres Bonifacio. His name also surfaces in the assassination of Heneral Luna, of recent Big Screen fame.

According to Filipino historian Xiao Chua, there isn’t enough support to such allegation that Aguinaldo had his fellow general killed. Chua, however, does not doubt that the president was responsible for the assassination of another revolutionary, Andres Bonifacio, whose face has now replaced his on the topical denomination. He cites the letter written by Aguinaldo himself wherein the latter admits to ordering Bonifacio’s killing in fear of the threat he posed to the government then.
Is the act of replacing Aguinaldo’s face with Bonifacio’s in the 2nd most circulated coin in the land an act of correcting the historical wrong done to the Supremo? Or is politics so deeply ingrained in Pinoy DNA that even to this day these two leaders of the revolution are still slugging it out for a rightful place in the hall of fame?
Note: Interestingly, Bonifacio appears to have blindsided Aguinaldo by appearing first in the P10 peso bill with Mabini several years back, before making the blitz pounce on the P5 coin. Nice maneuver there!
Inflation and the Need for a Major Change in Peso Coins and Bills
Recall the days when you could have a complete satisfying meal at a restaurant with just P10? Now a Hundred Pesos may not even be enough to buy a tube of Colgate toothpaste. There was a time the Philippine 1 Peso coin was so hefty huge, the metal content in it was already in itself like getting hands on valuable treasure. Now because of inflation, what is a 1 Peso coin worth?
Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas is in a key position to impact the country as they control the production of money. BSP’s New Generation Currency (NGC) series of coins and banknotes despite the fresh look and feel still appears to be found wanting.
With that backgrounder on the effects of inflation, let’s give some suggestions for BSP to ponder on for their next iteration of design releases. Just my 2 cents:
NGC Coin Series
1-Sentimo ⇒ No need, what can this buy?
5-Sentimo ⇒ No need, what can this buy?
25-Sentimo ⇒ Replace with a new 50-Sentimo coin
1-Piso ⇒ Hardly worth anything. Change to Aluminum, but keep Rizal’s face there!
5-Piso ⇒ Bonfacio (rather than Aguinaldo) – Congrats!
10-Piso ⇒ Tired old-looking Mabini should be replaced by someone more dashing
20-Piso ⇒ No need, 2 x 10 Peso coins will do
NGC Banknotes
20-piso ⇒ Make obsolete for the same reason
50-piso ⇒ Change to a coin
100-piso ⇒ Keep as is, or change to a coin
200-piso ⇒ No need, 2 x 100 Peso bills or coins will do
500-piso ⇒ An entire GRP article was devoted to rectifying this Yellow wrong
1000-piso ⇒ Replace those 3 hardly known faces with the emblem of SAF44 (with maybe PNoy’s laughing face at the background!)
5000-piso ⇒ Introduce this soon (maybe bring back Lapu-Lapu, who used to be in 1-Sentimo); there are too many millionaires in PH already
So there you have it: 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000-Piso Series is all we really need to shop and pay bills! And it sure makes for a simple systematic life, right?
Note: 50-Sentimo (0.5-Piso) being the smallest unit of currency will roughly match the value of 1 Yen in Japan and 1 Cent in the US!
Vending Machines and Cashless Society
Why aren’t vending machines prevalent in the Philippines? Is it because Pinoys have an aversion to automation? Oh yeah, they would rather sit behind a sari-sari store all day than have a machine do the hard work of waiting for them. It is difficult to make a national network of vending machines work if coins and bills keep changing. Pinoys need to stop being so fickle minded and keep a currency design locked for good (or for decades at least) for this to be viable. Look at other first world countries – their vending machines need little maintenance and updates because bills and coins stay standard for many, many years.
But the saving grace is for the country to embrace cashless payment. When you can get a smart phone for just P2000 and hopefully free wifi outdoors, there really is no excuse for not shifting to cashless transactions. A huge boost will be if government officially enforces massive adoption through laws and regulation. I guess this is where conspiracy theories on the angle that “COVID-19 was released on purpose” come in.
Traitors Out, Real Heroes In
We all know about how traitors find their way into legal tender to put in place the perfect “propaganda material” device into mass circulation for wholesale mind conditioning of the hoi polloi. The Duterte administration appears to have the wit and BALLS (like the those mentioned in the Megastar’s expletive laden pronouncement) to make major shifts and for making the tough decisions on whose faces get to be printed or minted on national currency. Let’s hope the most awaited removal of those laughing “ha ha nauto namin kayo!!!” faces on our P500 bill is in the offing. With that, Duterte can leave a lasting legacy of finally cleaning up a significant portion of the brainwashing mess that Yellowtardism has left on the country.
Let’s resonate the call to put real heroes in their rightful places. Where is Lapu-Lapu or the SAF44? How can they be remembered best except by giving them a rightful place on the limited currency real estate available and displacing fake heroes and shady characters?

Filipinos have more important things to worry about than woke “issues”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/filipinos-have-more-important-things-to-worry-about-than-woke-issues/,"If we are to believe our top “activists” and “thought leaders”, it would appear that the Philippines’ most pressing problems are the ABS-CBN broadcast franchise, the Anti-Terrorism Bill (which is now a law), and “gender issues”. Perhaps this is because the voices that dominate the discourse happen to be the ones who command strong followings in channels that have traditionally enjoyed a captured audience — television and university campus “happenings”. As a result, it is the “plight” of a politicised TV station and the threat to campus militantism that are given the most air time in the national discourse nowadays.
Do these “issues” really matter to ordinary Filipinos? That’s highly-debatable.
For one thing, the issues themselves are ill-framed. Take that of the ABS-CBN franchise renewal “issue”, for example. It is being framed as a “press freedom” thing. But to most ordinary Filipinos, ABS-CBN is no more than a source of cheap (free on television) entertainment. They see the corporate media behemoth not as a hero of “freedom” but as a mere distraction from the realities of their wretched lives. Small wonder that no big mass rallies have so far materialised to rescue ABS-CBN from the jaws of death despite the awesome “fandoms” of the likes of Kim Chiu and Coco Martin being mobilised to that end.
The difference today is that there are many other channels through which Filipinos get their information and their kicks. In the old days, before social media, campus activism did attract kibitzers at the very least — simply because there were no mobile phone screens connected to headphones at the time against which the shrill slogan chants and the red placards bobbing up and down during these circuses would have to compete for attention. Same with television. Whereas, in the past, Wowowee or It’s Showtime going off air would have been nothing short of a national disaster, today, Filipinos would very likely merely shrug and whip out their smartphones to google alternatives if that were to happen.
Filipinos are also better-informed (believe it or not) and, as such, less inclined to swallow nonsensical ideas and downright lies hook line and sinker. This is bad news for the communists in particular who seem forever stuck in a rhetoric that had failed to evolve since the end of the Cold War. Information on who and what parties had been in bed with the communists and vice-versa is literally at everyone’s fingertips and just about anyone can challenge their “street parliamentarians” on the sense (or lack of it) behind the tired slogans they brandish in their “rallies”. The idea of vandalising public property to get one’s messages across is no longer as dramatic as it used to be seeing that a new breed of digital creatives can put a meme before millions of eyeballs at the click of a button.
For lessons on what consequences await those who habitually insult the intelligence of their captured audience as ABS-CBN and the “woke” activists do today, one need look no further than the sad case of the Roman Catholic Church. The Church had the captured audience to end all captured audiences long before communism, television, and social media were invented. As recently as the 1980s, the Church was regarded as the eminent kingmaker of Philippine politics, so much so that no less than the late Jaime Cardinal Sin joined the other prominent Yellowtards of the time as venerated “heroes” of the 1986 “EDSA Revolution”. The Pastoral Letter which a priest reads before his wide-eyed congregation during the Homily segment of their Sunday Mass was a potent tool of mass persuasion rivaled only by television.
Today, the Church as a means to influence politics and upon which depended the political fortunes of oligarchs is but a shell of its former self thanks to the shortsightedness of its monarchs. Just like the hammer and sickle of the communists, and the “L” hand gesture of the Yellowtards, Catholic icons have lost their hypnotic effects on the masses. Years spent more on sticking to dogma and orthodox ideology and less on taking on board fresh ideas and evolving on the bases of these had made them all obsolete.
One idea that hasn’t become obsolete is the idea of the people’s will. Ultimately, the whole point of democracy is to ensure that the people’s will is given priority in decision making and legislation. This is the reason legislators and executive leaders are elected officials — because they being the popoular choice ensures that they represent this popular will. It is this simple feature of democracy that the Opposition seems to have lost sight of; instead, focusing on their pet notions that are simply irrelevant to the ordinary voter. One can argue that “human rights”, for example, is a noble concept worth “fighting” for. But, at the end of the day, you need political power to uphold it. And, under a democracy, the only way to legally acquire political power is to get elected. To do so, you and your platform need to be seen to be relevant to ordinary people.
The Opposition need to come down from their Ivory Tower and reconnect with their people. To do that they need to do less mutual high-fiving among themselves and take the time to listen with their ears close to the ground. They need to learn how to make themselves relevant again by charting a view of the future ordinary folk can directly relate with.",Politics
ABS-CBN supporters are beginning to act like a bunch of terrorists,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-supporters-are-beginning-to-act-like-a-bunch-of-terrorists/,"Now that the non-renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise to broadcast is a done deal, it seems Opposition partisans are at a loss around what to do next. This wholesale vexation in the party ranks illustrates just how thin on substance their platform is. Having made the “plight” of ABS-CBN and a handful of other manufactured pet “issues” cornerstones of their “dissent”, it is hardly surprising to see them now scrounging around for their next “fight” or the next big thing to shore up any semblance of their relevance to ordinary Filipinos.
Filipinos need to remain ever more vigilant. The loss of ABS-CBN evidently hit hard and it seems this is making the Opposition camp desperate.
Recently, there’s been reports of Opposition partisans and “activists” disowning their own parents over ABS-CBN and other such “issues”. Disowning one’s own parents is remarkable in a society such as the Philippines where elders continue to be generally revered and where young people tend to continue living in their parents’ homes well into their 30’s. Thus, choosing politics over one’s own parents is almost cult-like in nature — not too different from the teachings of the original ideologues of communism…
The new ideologues explicitly stated the need to destroy the family. A. M. Kollontay, one of the Communist party’s most active family policy makers, formulated this need in no uncertain terms as far back as 1918: “The family is doomed. It will be destroyed.” N. Bukharin also wrote that “in a Communist society, when private property and oppression of women finally come to an end, so, too, will prostitution and marriage.”
This also likely explains why communists in the Philippines don’t seem to show any form of outrage over the plight of parents who’ve seen their kds recruited into the New People’s Army often never to be seen again. Indeed, again looking back…
…it was Soviet Russia that, for the first time in the history of continental European law, allowed the state on vaguely defined grounds to remove children from their parents. Article 46 of the 1926 Code stated that a court can take children away from their parents “in cases when the parents either fail to carry out or abuse their obligations towards the children, or abuse said children”; when leaving the children in their family is deemed “dangerous,” child protective services can remove the children before any court ruling.
Not only are we seeing the makings of such mind conditioning happening today in pockets of Filipino youth affiliated with today’s Opposition, there is also evidence of more aggressive forms of “activism” — bordering on sedition, even terrorism — brewing across sectors of this disgruntled camp. Just the other night, a “noise barrage” coming from a motorcade of cars honking their horns erupted at the La Vista, Quezon City residence of Party-list Representative for ANAKALUSUGAN Mike Defensor who is seen to be one of the legislators instrumental in the “shutdown” of ABS-CBN. The stunt was reportedly not well-attended but was nonetheless condoned and cheered on by Opposition partisans on social media.
One wonders, however, what these sorts of circuses seek to achieve. So a “noise barrage” transpired. So what?
Evidently, Opposition partisans have lost any ability to form a platform or ideological frame that extends beyond the next “mass action”. Indeed, they don’t even have a plan around how to get the “mass” back into that term seeing how anemic attendance has been in these activities recent years. What is glaringly missing in these preferred approaches to “dissent” is a clear roadmap towards an end that can be achieved within the legal frame and within processes enshrined in existing democratic institutions.
If, for example, the Opposition would really like to “avenge” ABS-CBN in the next national election in 2022, it remains unclear what their approach to winning that election is and, more imporantly, who will lead their bloc to that aspired-for victory. Certainly, stunts like “noise barrages” and mananita rallies offer no clear pathways to electoral victory anymore, yet they continue to subbornly regard these as essential activities in their “activist” arsenal.
A disturbing implication of this baffling fixation on extra-legal means to get things done preferred by the Opposition is that legal pathways as a means to achieving ends are being less and less considered to be viable options as frustration with mounting political losses grows in the Opposition camps. This is an ominous sign and, as mentioned earlier, even more cause for the government and all Filipinos to be vigilant lest dangerous elements foment the sort of instability that could be exploited by the Opposition to do just that.
The case of the ABS-CBN “issue” follows an all-too-familiar template where partisans and “activists” would avidly follow due process then suddenly turn against it when said process yields an outcome they do not like. That kind of selective democratism is the dishonest trademark of today’s Opposition, one, in all ironies, led by a bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) who have long upheld a claim to the 1986 “EDSA Revolution” on the back of which was framed the 1987 Philippine Constitution.",Politics
Opposition to campaign on a Revenge Platform for the 2022 elections following ABS-CBN shutdown,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/opposition-to-campaign-on-a-revenge-platform-for-the-2022-elections-following-abs-cbn-shutdown/,"Not to be outdone following the denied renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise to broadcast on Friday, the Opposition have now set their sights on the 2022 national elections for their “revenge”. Indeed, top Opposition “thought leaders” are now gearing up for the “fight” and crafting a Revenge Platform for that purpose as prominent “activist” Gang Badoy seems to be suggesting in this tweet…
Exciting times indeed. That the Opposition plans to run on a showbiz platform and one fueled by a woke bloodlust to “avenge” ABS-CBN will make for a colourful and lucrative campaign extravaganza in the lead up to 2022. Unfortunately, the now-darkened Yellowtard network will no longer be able to reap the billions of pesos in ad revenue that will be generated by such a circus.
Then again, it is likely that most ordinary Filipinos will have moved on from or even forgotten ABS-CBN by then. Indeed, after a frenzy of “trending” hashtags in the midst of the ABS-CBN brouhaha just yesterday, a quick look at trending topics on Twitter the day after shows how quickly Filipinos turn their attention to other things more relevant to their day-to-day lives after the curtain goes down on such shows.
More importantly, the fact that the Opposition would actually espouse such an intellectually-bankrupt campaign platform as the Revenge Platform upon which former ABS-CBN starlets would run, as Badoy suggests, proves just how singularly-focused the Yellowtards are at seizing power at all costs. They would go as far as encouraging Filipino voters to vote like starstruck ignoramuses just to further their dishonest power-hungry agenda.
Dishonesty heaped upon dishonesty is how the Yellowtard-led Opposition operates. It further highlights how sharp a tool ABS-CBN was in a decades-long effort to keep Filipinos too dazzled by artistas and OA songs and dances to choose wisely come election day. Fortunately the demise of ABS-CBN now presents an opportunity for the national discourse to dial back and rebuild a truly intelligent national debate on a level playing field — without the shadow ABS-CBN had long cast upon the sort of modern conversation that would have normally befit the mature democracy that the Philippines could have been over the last several decades.",Politics
"Noise barrages, prayer, and OA sentimentality won’t bring back ABS-CBN’s franchise to broadcast",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/noise-barrages-prayer-and-oa-sentimentality-wont-bring-back-abs-cbns-franchise-to-broadcast/,"All the members of ABS CBN fandom can come up with are ineffectual emo stunts and circuses that do nothing more than actually highlight what a flaccid community they are. A video posted an Instagram shows such people making noise (banging on some sort of metal surface) and lighting candles in what looks like some sort of vigil in front of the network’s head office building.
On Twitter, a who’s-who of celebrities and public personalities wax sentiment over the “demise” of their “beloved” network. Glenda Gloria, “co-founder and managing editor” of “social news” site Rappler issues some words on Twitter despite claiming that there are none such that could be uttered…
The big mystery here is around what exactly these “activists” hope to achieve. Actor and TV host Kim Atienza, for example, can only encourage people on Twitter to make a little noise and pray as ABS-CBN starts to lay off employees.
ABS-CBN News “journalist” Mike Navallo, for his part, seems to suggest in a tweet that vengeance will be forthcoming sometime in the future but stops short of any sort of useful specifics.
Neither Atienza nor Navallo actually offer anything useful to the legions of wailing ABS-CBN fantards.
There really is only one pathway to fixing ABS-CBN’s problems. The biggest clue here is around who or what is in a position to determine whether or not it gets a new franchise to broadcast — none other than Congress. And how do the “right” people get membership in that powerful club? Why, none other way but by winning an election. The solution is therefore quite obvious. The Yellowtards need to win big in the next national elections in 2022. Only then will their “beloved” ABS-CBN get a shot at a new lease on the airwaves.
The Opposition need to re-learn an important democratic skill — winning elections. They won’t acquire that skill by sitting around banging a steel pan, lighting candles on a sidewalk, or praying.",Politics
ABS-CBN inciting “people power” mass protests putting THOUSANDS at risk!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-inciting-people-power-mass-protests-putting-thousands-at-risk/,"What are supporters and former employees of ABS-CBN thinking inciting mass protests over their execs’ failure to secure a franchise renewal? What do they hope to achieve? “People power” rallies are so 1980s. More recent ones failed to move people, what more one that is focused more on the plight of a media network and not much on an issue of national consequence that is relevant to the broader public?
More importantly, all these rallies and noise barrages being organised do nothing but snarl traffic in an already gridlocked metropolis and put hundreds of thousands of people at risk by further fuelling the spread of the COVID-19 virus on account of their gathering in large numbers. This is all thanks to a stubborn habit an Opposition led by rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) continues to apply to its “cause”.
Even more disturbing is how they are emotionally-blackmailing contracted performers of ABS-CBN into joining these protests. Kapamilya starlet Angel Locsin, speaking before a crowd gathered in front of the corporate head office in Quezon City called out what she regards as apathetic colleagues, denouncing how they’d rather glam themselves on Instagram  rather than join their mass action.
On cue, Netizens had started judging celebrities such as Sarah Geronimo just because they are moving on and focusing on making a living in a post-ABS-CBN world.
And to what end?
What next after this circus?
Even now, the Opposition offer no pathway forward within the legal framework to further their dishonest “cause”. They are likely hoping to incite unrest and, very likely, are aiming to topple the Philippine government illegally. After all, the rejection of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal was done observing all legal processes all within the remit of Congressional authority over this matter.
This just means that the next opportunity for ABS-CBN to make its case under a more “favourable” political environment can come only after a victory of the Opposition in the coming 2022 national elections. To achieve that, they will need to win that election, which means mounting a successful campaign on a platform that resonates with the broader Philippine public. Needless to say, they will also need a leader at least as charismatic as current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who remains overwhelmingly popular.
Unfortunately for the Opposition, they tick none of the above boxes, which is probably why they are betting their houses on these quaint ocho-ocho rallies. If they can’t come up with a plan for themselves, what more for an entire nation? At least Sarah Geronimo looks like she has a plan for a life outside of ABS-CBN. It’s time Filipinos see that as their inspiration to move on as well and focus on what is important and not on just another beaten relic of a misguided accidental “revolution”.",Politics
There is no proof Twitter suspended accounts just because they were supportive of the Duterte government,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/there-is-no-proof-twitter-suspended-accounts-just-because-they-were-supportive-of-the-duterte-government/,"A Washington Post article has caused a stir among Filipino Netizens recently after it claimed popular social networking site Twitter suspended accounts “defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic”.
When I saw the article making the rounds, the first thing I thought was that it was quite suspect that a foreign media owned company would write about harmless activities of Filipinos online. Then when I read it, my suspicion was confirmed. The article was written by a Filipino, so-called “journalist” Regine Cabato who works for the Washington Post and yet another one of those “media practitioners” who could not separate her partisan sentiment from her work. The article was badly-written and had too many logical holes. It was obvious the writer was just trying to piece together her own biases about separate unrelated events and then came to her own conclusion that Twitter decided to suspend accounts supporting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Cabato claimed that hashtags initiated by the Opposition #OustDuterte mobilised government supporters online to counter it with their own hashtags #IStandWithThePresident and #YesToABSCBNShutdown, which brought down the ranking of #OustDuterte hashtag. She also implied that accounts supportive of the government are mere “trolls”, saying they had “suspicious elements” such as “bot-like numbers on Twitter handles, few followers and new accounts”.
Her analysis fails the “So what”? test. A lot of Filipinos would be new to Twitter because, unlike Facebook, Twitter is not part of the free data scope of many Philippine telco providers. Getting charged to use it would have turned them off signing up earlier on. Besides, the character limit imposed by Twitter is something a lot of Filipinos are not used to which is why they do not find it as “useful” as Facebook.
To be honest, Cabato’s article gave me goosebumps. It made me cringe. If you read her article, which I know would be hard because it got bumped down the feedline, you would wonder how it got published on the Washington Post at all. It was total nonsense.  It wasn’t based on facts, but only on the writer’s hunch. Here’s an excerpt:
On April 1, a video report by broadcasting giant ABS-CBN on arrests among the urban poor went viral.
#OustDuterte became the top trending hashtag in the Philippines.
The next day, the hashtags #IStand With The President and #YesToABSCBNShutdown trended. The network is facing issues regarding the renewal of its franchise, and celebrities under its entertainment circle also decried the government response.
By April 3, critics responded with #ICantStandThe President. On April 4, troll-like accounts responded to #OustDuterte with #OursDuterte.
What a piece of crap, right? What kind of journalist would write something as shallow as that? Most likely a journalist who cannot think outside of the box and who is suffering from tunnel vision. Cabato appears to hate the Duterte government so much that the only thing she could write about during a pandemic is about trolls. She thinks that just because someone supports the government, one could already assume that that person is a troll. She didn’t even give any data or say how many of the accounts she claims Twitter suspended are “bot-like”. It seems as if she was just making things up.
I tried to ask her politely on Twitter how she came to the conclusion that Twitter suspended only Duterte government supporters but I did not get a response. She probably thinks I was just trolling her. That’s another problem with members of the Opposition, they are good at ignoring people who ask questions that put them on the spot.
Instead of responding, Cabato took a dig at Get Real Philippines writers and said she finds it “troubling when the people who advise our politicians’ campaigns are informed by Get Real PH instead of news organizations.”
The idea that politicians are being “informed” by GRP writers is another strange product of Cabato’s imagination. Let’s just say what she is saying is true – that politicians are paying more attention to our advice than that of members of mainstream media. That’s only because a lot of writers from news organizations like her employer do not have anything intelligent to add to the conversation. They do not present alternative solutions to solving the country’s problems. Cabato’s article is a classic example of something published by a major news organisation like Washington Post that, unfortunately, lacks substance. It was pure click-bait. It’s not surprising that savvy politicians are not taking journalists like her seriously.
Cabato is not a true professional and this is evident in how she couldn’t be bothered to take stock of points of view from both sides of the fence. She only took soundbites from Noemi Dado who is a known rabid member of the Opposition. Dado hates everything about Duterte and thinks everyone who disagrees with her are trolls. As a journalist, Cabato should have taken another point of view just to balance her article. One can be forgiven for saying Cabato was acting like a troll herself – just trying to stir controversy with her article and then ignoring demands to provide evidence of her claims.",Politics
Filipino “activists” are using demands for COVID-19 “mass testing” to further their DISHONEST political agenda,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/filipino-activists-are-using-demands-for-covid-19-mass-testing-to-further-their-dishonest-political-agenda/,"Filipino “activists” and Opposition partisans calling for COVID-19 “mass testing” to be implemented have so far failed to issue precise definitions of what they mean exactly. This reveals evident dishonesty in their intent. It remains unclear what it is exactly they want to happen beyond what continues to be the broader perception of their agenda — to make the Philippine government look bad by claiming it is not “doing enough”.
Reports in early May suggested that the national testing capacity stood at 3,000 per day with a backlog of almost 10,000 test results to be analysed or released. The government also says it aims to test up to 2 percent of the population or about two million people. It is unclear whether the government’s stated target of increasing testing capacity to 30,000 per day is consistent with that sample size target. In any case, there is mounting evidence that the testing capacity target will not be met by the end of May.
What then do the “activists” and Opposition partisans mean by “mass testing” exactly?  Is it the government’s 2 million people sample size target? Is it its 30,000 testing capacity per day target? If neither, do Opposition partisans and “activists” propose a quantitative target of their own? It seems they are not up to the job of doing their own maths.
“Social news network” Rappler, for example, offers no such number even as it makes itself a sounding board for the Opposition “demand” for mass testing. In one of its “reports” it regurgitates the opinion of “UP expert” Professor Jomar Rabajante of the “UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team” who says (translated in English by the report author), “A good way to fight this pandemic is not prolonged ECQ but mass testing, isolation, and contact tracing. This is where we should invest.” Other than that, no number to serve as a comparison to the quantified government targets is offered by said “expert”.
The author of this Rappler “report” Bonz Magsambol, instead, goes on to cite his expert’s “wisdom” on the matter…
Rabajante said that although the coronavirus test kits are expensive, the government should invest in them instead of always extending the ECQ.
“Ano ang gusto natin? Mag-invest sa testing and puwede mag-open ang economy? Or forever closed ang economy at walang dadaan na pera?” Rabajante said.
(What do we want? Invest in testing so we can reopen the economy? Or forever shut down the economy and not have money circulating?)
It seems said Rappler “expert” source is not only being put up as an expert on the disease but also made out to be some sort of “economist” seeing that his less-than-expert opinion on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the Philippine economy is also given space here.
The Facebook page Mass Testing Now PH also offers zero clarity on the matter. In a note spelling out their “demands” to the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, no such number is offered either…
We, the Filipino people, plead for your urgent action in response to the COVID-19 crisis our nation is facing. Here are our demands:
1. START MASS TESTING NOW. Implement free mandatory mass testing nationwide and mobilize the local government units (LGUs) to set-up local testing centers.
2. Distribute free face masks, hand soaps, alcohol, drinking water rations, and vitamins to every barangay. Conduct massive disinfection in high-traffic locations regularly.
[blah blah blah…]
A total of ten demands are listed but no precise numbers to compare to the government’s quantitative targets can be found — which means there is no precise basis offered by this group either to clearly define why they think the government is not “doing enough”.
Opposition partisans and “activists” also latch on to celebrities like actress Angel Locsin for thought leadership. A tweet by the starlet that had been “trending” recently illustrates the same intellectual bankruptcy of their lot…
Ang lakas ng loob mong magsabi ng common sense eh hindi mo nga alam ang meaning ng “mass”🙄 hay. Kung may mass burial ba na gagawin, kasama ka ba sa ililibing bilang buong 110M ng population ang nilalaban mo? Hindi naman, di ba? So anong kinagagalit mo? Kumalma ka https://t.co/6SPBGNwHOS

Translated… You have the nerve citing “common sense” in your argument. You don’t even know the meaning of “mass”. If there is a mass burial, would it mean including yourself in all 110 million of the population who you would argue would be buried? No, right? So why be angry? Calm down!
Despite all the rhetoric, whether coming from a “UP expert”, a Facebook “activist” group or a showbiz starlet like Locsin, it is still unclear what is meant by the “mass testing” the Opposition is calling for.
The mystery persists.
What do the Opposition mean exactly when they call for “mass testing”?

Take the case of members of the Philippine Opposition. I’m not just talking about the foot soldiers like Jover Laurio. I’m talking about the top honchos too like Florin Hilbay who was Solicitor General, albeit for a very brief moment, during the previous administration and former Senator Antonio Trillanes. They are two of many from the other side who have done nothing but whine against President Rodrigo Duterte. Even during a pandemic they seem to be unable to get past this unproductive habit.
“What’s new?” you might ask. Nothing, really. I guess it is partly my fault for expecting that they would put any bitter feelings aside and work towards a common goal while the whole world is dealing with a deadly novel coronavirus – a virus that has cancelled almost every activity that keeps humans busy.
In case you just came out from under a rock, in the last month the Philippines, just like a lot of other countries has been on lockdown or, as Duterte prefers to call it, Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Citizens are directed to stay home and only go out for important business like shopping for necessities and other essential activities. Obviously, this has created a lot of issues for people unable to work or pursue a livelihood and, likewise, is a major inconvenience to everyone. There is no life outside of our homes at the moment. Yes, things can get quite depressing and, especially since the quarantine is going on its second month, some people are starting to lose their marbles. They can’t seem to think straight anymore and are going on a major rampage against those calling the shots.
Members of the Opposition were already feeling powerless prior to the pandemic, but now they probably feel even more impotent because they can’t go out and protest in the streets. All they can do is make noise on social media. The funny thing about people like Hilbay and Trillanes is that their statements against Dutere cannot be considered genuine criticism. They are mostly acts of character assassination, which serve no purpose other than to entertain their own followers. Here’s one from Hilbay:
Can you believe that guy used to be the SolGen? No wonder he hardly ever wins any of his court cases. But I digress…
Seriously, Hilbay showed his immaturity yet again. There is nothing to learn from his comments. If he doesn’t want to watch Duterte’s regular press conferences while the country is under quarantine, no one is forcing him to do it. But why is Hilbay telling others not to watch it too? I thought he was an advocate of individual rights? It seems he is not keen on giving other people the freedom to choose whether to watch Duterte or not. You can bet your hard-earned peso he would be the first to complain if Duterte doesn’t conduct his presscons. And you can bet that he secretly watches the presscons anyway, he just doesn’t want to admit it. Obviously he wants to be the first to break the news if Duterte commits any faux pas so it is likely he can’t help but watch the President even though he publicly expresses his disdain. Hilbay is a frustrated little man. He makes a lot of noise to compensate for the losses in his career.
Trillanes, another bozo suffering from a crisis of relevance, also posted something on his Twitter account that proved he has a nasty and violent nature.
First of all, as a former lawmaker, Trillanes should know that budgets are planned expenses for the coming year. Has he forgotten that he was part of those who deliberated budgets proposed by the Chief Executive every year? The funds are already allotted to different departments and projects. Unfortunately, there is no budget to address the increasing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Second, if Trillanes doesn’t want to donate to people in hardship during the crisis, that’s his choice. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to donate. Only someone as calloused as Trillanes would brag about his unwillingness to help people in hardship. What he and his followers do not realise is, he is showing that he is not generous. It’s not cool to show one doesn’t want to help and it’s not nice to discourage others from helping during a crisis, especially since no one can foresee when the COVID-19 pandemic will be over. Even in First World countries, ordinary citizens and wealthy people alike are compelled to donate during a crisis because a crisis is quite often an unforeseen event. It doesn’t make sense that people like Trillanes would expect the government from a Third World country to have the funds to shoulder all the expense.
It’s quite evident that members of the Opposition are not very smart. They do not know when to stay quiet. They feel compelled to say something against Duterte even when it’s obvious they are just scraping the bottom of the barrel. The public can see through this particularly when they know that Duterte is dealing with a lot of issues at the moment. The last thing he needs is to deal with people whose only agenda is to undermine his efforts at a time he needs all the help he can get to keep the people and the economy alive.",Politics
We need a more INTELLIGENT “troll” narrative,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/we-need-a-more-intelligent-troll-narrative/,"The Filipino people need to put their collective foot down and take the social media “troll” narrative back into the level playing field of the broader public discourse. At the moment, the “woke” members of the Opposition, particularly the most rabid bloc within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards), presume to be the sole judge of who is a “troll” or what a “troll” is. They exercise their self-appointment as judges in a Yellowtard court they set up with their liberal Mainstream Media allies to both rule on and bear down on those they summarily deem to be “trolls”.
Manila Times columnist and self-appointed “social media expert” Noemi Dado so succinctly encapsulates this arrogant and presumptuous position Yellowtardom takes on “troll” politics here…
“Trolls [and] supporters [of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte] are mostly reactive to the organic display of criticism,” said Noemi Dado, a blogger and member of the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation. “Duterte is supposed to have a high satisfaction rating… so the trolls must make it look like Duterte is loved.”
…that it was used as a key reference in the now-infamous dishonest Washington Post “report” authored by its Manila correspondent Regine Cabato which I featured in a previous article.
Cabato’s public dishonesty stems from her attempt to mislead people into thinking that the main criteria used by Twitter to suspend users is their support for the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. This is evident in the title of said piece, “Twitter suspends accounts defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic”.
Totally dishonest indeed. Twitter, like many other large social media platforms, apply generally consistent sets of guidelines to ensure “community standards” are adhered to but don’t include any sort of partisan affiliation as criteria for determining violations. Thus, to claim that Twitter singles out “accounts defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic” is absolutely unfounded.
Cabato’s behaviour when challenged to clarify the sloppy journalism she subjects her readers to is also typical of the arrogance “woke” Opposition partisans contribute to the national discourse. Cabato says she finds it “troubling when the people who advise our politicians’ campaigns are informed by Get Real PH instead of news organizations.” This is a bit sad coming from a Washington Post “reporter” seeing how a person employed by an enterprise within a declining industry struggles to defend it. Indeed, “news organisations” aren’t exactly enjoying their heyday as far as people’s trust goes nowadays. “Journalists” are seriously overdue for a bit of reflection seeing how practitioners such as Cabato routinely make assertions they are woefully unable to back with verifiable specifics.
In the end, the only recourse “woke” people like Cabato habitually take is to silence people who dissent.
Ironic, right? More so considering that Cabato describes herself in her Twitter profile as a “tough cookie” who “blooms in adversity”.
Double unfortunate is how “woke” journalism pulls down into the abyss it is falling into erstwhile noble liberal Western concepts such as “human rights”. No less than Filipino “human rights” guru himself, the eminent Carlos Conde, weighed in on the Cabato imbroglio tweeting that, “[if] you are a journalist and you get attacked by the morons over at Get Real PH, that means you are doing your job.”
Let’s examine more closely Conde’s logic, which basically goes like this…
IF you get “attacked” by GRP;
THEN “you are doing your job”
Scratch that. The above is an insult to the very notion of logic. Conde fails at the most basic principle of intelligent conversation — establishing a sound premise to frame one’s argument. Conde builds his entire argument upon two lame pillars: (1) that Cabato was “attacked” by GRP and (2) that Cabato was “doing her job”. Firstly, Conde has so far failed to exhibit any evidence that such an attack transpired and continues to fail to produce such despite several challenges to step up and do so. And then there is the idea that Regine Cabato was “doing her job”. Perhaps she was. The question is what defines said “job”? Was it a job as a true journalist in the honourable sense of the profession, or a job as lackey of the owners of the very chi chi but increasingly irrelevant Washington Post?
Dialling back to what defines a real troll, it seems that self-proclaimed “thought leaders” like “social media expert” Noemi Dado, Washington Post “reporter” Regine Cabato, and “human rights activist” Carlos Conde are the ones who exhibit the very trollish behaviour they presume to rail about. They issue assertions they are unable to substantiate specially when challenged to do so, make liberal use of credentials to demand that their arguments be deferred to, defend their hollow assertions using medieval reasoning, and silence dissent when challenged to respond.
It is high time Filipinos open their eyes to the blatant insult to their intelligence these people dishonestly institutionalise as “thought leadership” and “journalism”. It’s time Filipinos take back their public political discourse and take to task those who seek to pervert it towards their insidious agendas.",Politics
The Communists are LYING. No one actually said that “Criticism = Terrorism”!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/the-communists-are-lying-no-one-actually-said-that-criticism-terrorism/,"It is actually quite baffling the way Opposition “activists” are rallying around the nonsensical slogan “Criticism is not Terrorism”. To begin with no such assertion had been made by anyone as far as I am aware. I don’t even think these “activists” themselves would be able to name any specific person who’d be stupid enough to assert that criticism is the equivalent of terrorism.
In short, the communists who are on a campaign to push for the “junking” of the proposed Anti Terrorism Bill are waging a phony battle. What is interesting is that the people who really do regard criticism as “terrorism” are the very Opposition “thought leaders” who routinely block people who challenge their points of view (as failed Senate candidate Florin Hilbay does)  or summarily tag their critics as “trolls” (as failed Rappler CEO Maria Ressa does).
Indeed, for the Yellowtards, the clique within the Opposition rapidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan, demonising criticism has practically become a cult. The term “troll”, like that other favourite snowflakes’ bogeyman “Fake News” has been dropped too often that it has been rendered meaningless and is now regarded as just a quaint Yellowtard punchline. We all have to thank the astounding inconsistency with which the Yellowtards apply their “principles” to their sophomoric “activism” for that.
When a social media user toes the “liberal” Yellowtard or communist line, that user is a “Netizen” and enjoys a high chance of getting generous citations in various “reports” all over mainstream media — specially “social news network” Rappler where the idea of “journalism” is a nebulous vibe crafted to suit the political and personal agendas of its CEO Maria Ressa.
And the rest of the lot? They are “trolls”. So anyone deemed disagreeable by the chi chi “thought leaders” of Yellowtardom gets summarily slapped that label — a convenient one that erstwhile attracted social stigma.
Even more shocking, that other ironic ally of convenience of the communists and Yellowtards, the Roman Catholic Church, also lives by a policy of regarding critics as terrorists. Recall in 2017 how the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) released a list of “fake news” sites which included GetRealPhilippines.com. The CBCP list included only sites perceived to be critical of the Liberal Party and the broader Opposition to the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. No sites associated with the Opposition camps were included in this list.
It is therefore quite amusing to see the communists and their pals in “arms” against their temporary common enemy claiming to be “outraged” over the possibility of being “summarily” labelled a terrorist considering they themselves have long been busy doing the same to their critics. Theirs is a dishonest “activism” meant to distract Filipinos from the reality of their flagging credibility. They seek to mask the indisputable fact that they coddle the bloodthirsty New People’s Army and seek to soften the reality of their terrorism by making everyone believe they are merely “critics” of the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. The fact is they don’t merely aim to criticise. Their aim is to overthrow the government — any legitimate government for that matter — in a violent “revolution” by any means possible, including the use of terrorism.",Politics
Here’s what you need to know about the Anti-Terrorism Bill,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-anti-terrorism-bill/,"The world of social media is once again abuzz with the collective whinging of the “wokes” in unison with the caterwauling of the usual faces of NPA “legal” front representatives and their sympathizers as the looming “threat” of the Anti-Terrorism Bill passing into law approaches.As an observant citizen I cannot, for the life of me, comprehend what’s more laughable. Is it the fact that (a) the college youth, the so-called “wokes,” are quick to sympathize with terrorist elements and react vehemently to a proposed bill without even reading it; OR (b) that air-headed celebrities left and right are commenting on a matter that is clearly out of their ken, while again, having not read the bill?Before we lose ourselves in pointless bickering and countless appeals to emotion to junk the Anti-Terrorism Bill, let’s make it clear what the Bill IS and ISN’T.For reference, the 3rd Reading copy of the Bill can be found here.For those lazy to read or simply do not have time, here’s the Anti-Terrorism Bill in a nutshell:1. First and foremost, it establishes the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), which shall work in coordination with related government agencies to carry out its mandate of combating and preventing violent extremism and terrorism. The ATC shall implement that Anti-Terrorism Bill in its full force.2. The Anti-Terrorism Bill (ATB) did not point out any specific group or individual as terrorists, but merely defined what constitutes as acts of terrorism.The Sec. 4 of ATB concisely defined acts of terrorism as engaging in either one or all of the following acts committed (regardless of stage of execution) by any person within or outside of the Philippines:
3. Section 4(e) emphasizes, however, that terrorism does NOT include advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights not intended to cause serious physical harm, endangerment of life, serious risk to public safety, or death.4. For sections 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, The ATB shall punish people who:
5. Section 10 is particularly juicy as it provides for the recruitment to and membership in a terrorist organization. This provision bunched a lot of panties especially those of the NPA cadres and their sympathizers.Under this section, individuals who recruit persons into what are considered as terrorist groups by the UN National Security Council or groups who perform the aforementioned acts of terrorism shall be dealt with accordingly.The ATB shall also penalize persons who recruit another person to serve in the armed force of a foreign state; those who publish advertisements or propaganda for said armed force or ads and propaganda that lay out ways for application; and those who perform any other act with the intent of recruiting persons to the same.6. Under Section 16, it allows surveillance of suspects provided that there is probable cause and there is a written request which is subsequently granted by the Court of Appeals.The “suspects” pertained to by Section 16 are:
7. The ATB “allowing and/or condoning warrantless arrest” is a myth. In the first place, law enforcing bodies are allowed to conduct warrantless arrest if the perpetrator is caught red-handed. This is called the “In flagrante delicto” rule.8. Section 30 provides that apprehended individuals shall be granted the usual rights of person under custodial detention, and violation of these rights shall be dealt with accordingly.9. Lastly, Section 33 provides explicitly that NO TORTURE OR COERCION will be allowed nor conducted during investigation and interrogation.Now, this might seem a lot to swallow, but this is the shortest I can discuss the matter without getting too technical or legalese. I hope this at least sheds a light on this topic. But before I end this piece, I would like to address the “wokes.”Given that reading comprehension among Pinoys is low, it will do you good to actually try to read and exercise critical thinking once in a while. “Critical thinking” does not mean criticizing something without thought or vestiges of objectivity and rationality because then, you’re just being “critical” without the “thinking” part.Until you realize what it means to actually employ critical thinking in your lives, you remain, as always, a gullible and laughable crowd of entitled snowflakes who are far from ready to take charge of anything, let alone comment in anything political.",Politics
How the comms team of President Noynoy Aquino used Facebook for its own DISHONEST propaganda,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/how-the-comms-team-of-president-noynoy-aquino-used-facebook-for-its-own-dishonest-propaganda/,"Nowadays, the Philippine Opposition led by the bloc within it rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan incessantly beat the drum about “pro-administration trolls” who are part of a government conspiracy to propagate “fake news” and, of course, “silence dissent”. The “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards would like Filipinos to believe that the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte hold a monopoly over this sort of thing. However, just a quick look to the not-so-distant past reveals a profoundly industrialised dishonesty the Yellowtards applied to state communications when they were in power.
In a 2011 Manila Standard piece, The impromptu war, the late Jojo Robles offers us a glimpse into then President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III’s Malacanang social media war room as it mounted a frantic but futile defense against a barrage of inquiries being fielded by administration critics over social media channels like Facebook and Twitter during the much-hyped appearance of President Aquino on the YouTube video series World View…
The top Internet propaganda strategist of Malacanang was in a foul-mouthed, hair-pulling rage. For an entire day last week, he and his army of paid Facebook page “administrators” and commenters were working as hard as they could, deleting critical posts and attempting to bury them under an avalanche of pro-government declarations and small talk.
And yet, for all their efforts, the critical questions and the occasional heckling would not be stopped. How was this possible, especially on this day, when the President was supposed to be answering sanitized questions softly thrown by a Google executive who had no idea at all of what was going on in the Philippines?
It is evident that silencing dissent was something the Yellowtards themselves were not above. In fact, as Robles shows, they clearly used state resources to do just that under the Aquino government. It gets worse, however. The story of dishonest media manipulation perpetrated by the Yellowtards goes even further back. This is the same mob of crooked people who allegedly hijacked the original Noynoy Aquino Facebook fan page (BSA3) set up by Califorinia-based Ben Totanes and Betty Abrantes in 2009.
Totanes and Abrantes set up the ill-fated Facebook “fan page” of President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, BSA3 at Facebook.com/Noynoy.Aquino to gather support to push for a rallying behind Noynoy’s candidacy shortly after the death of his mother former President Corazon Aquino in August 2009. They were then enlisted by Vicente Romano III head of Aquino’s New Media Bureau (and whose claim to fame also comes from being one of the pioneers of on-line petition campaigns in Philippine politics after mounting such an effort against then President Joseph Estrada in 2000) into the campaign.
After amassing more than 1.5 million fans by the time Noynoy was sworn in as President in June of 2010, Abrantes and Totanes found out the hard way what sorts of consequences dealing with crooks yield.
Reported GMA News TV…
[…] after the election, Romano allegedly recommended that the fan page be shut down. Instead, Totanes and Abrantes offered to turn over administration of the page to the then newly-formed Presidential Communications Group on the condition that comments critical of the administration would not be removed.
“Sinabi ko sa kanila na pwede pa rin nila gamitin ito, ngunit dapat pamalagiin itong ‘Feedback Forum’ ng sambayanang Pilipino, at huwag tatanggalin ang mga comments — ‘pro or anti’ ng mga tao,” he said.
(I told them that they can still use the fan page, as long as it’s maintained as a venue for feedback from the Filipino people. No comments must be removed, be they negative or positive.)
Coloma allegedly disagreed with Totanes’ conditions, and decided to set up a new official fan page, PresidentNoy at Facebook.com/PresidentNoy, in August this year.
And then…
On November 9, Totanes received an email directly from Facebook administrators saying that the BSA3 fan page “has been removed for violating (Facebook’s) Terms of Use.”
An official statement from Malacanang issued by then Presidential Communications Group head Sec. Herminio Coloma declined to comment on whether Malacanang had a hand in the sudden closure of the original BSA3 page. According to AllFacebook.com (functional at the time), the number of “likes” on the fan page of the new PresidentNoy Facebook page suddenly jumped in number from about 100,000 as of the 8th of November to almost 1.6 million as of the 11th of November of that year.
All the posturing of today’s Yellowtard-led Opposition only shows that it takes one to know one. They are the first to take great pains to manipulate social media messaging, use state resources to intervene in public discourse, and suppress dissenting points of view. More importantly, it reveals just how dishonest they are, even to their own supporters. The Yellowtards are hypocrites, plain and simple. Filipinos should be extra vigilant and acquire the habit of lending a critical eye to anything they say. They should educate themselves with facts, both historical and present to equip them to make informed decisions on things of national consequence.",Politics
The Philippines needs a strong police and army more than ever,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/the-philippines-needs-a-strong-police-and-army-more-than-ever/,"Terrorists are getting bolder as it becomes ever more pointedly evident that the Opposition (specifically its leading blocs, the communists and the Yellowtards) regard demonisation of the police and the military as cornerstones of their sick ideologies. Indeed, Filipinos have long suspected strong links between the Yellowtards (the bloc of rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists seeing how, back in the 1980s, the late former President Cory Aquino upon grabbing power made it one of her top priorities to release key communist leaders from prison. Both camps habitually push for extra-constitutional — basically criminal — approaches to changes in leadership as well as paint Filipinos as chronic victims of circumstances that are, in actual fact, of their own making.
This habitual painting of the army and police under a bad light by the current Opposition traces its roots to the “Martial Law” rhetoric that bred an entire generation of Martial Law Crybabies and three decades of the ensuing crybabyism dominating the national political narrative. It did not seem to occur to these partisans that a strong nation that lives by the rule of law is made possible by a strong military and a world-class police force. Now, nobody is saying that the Philippines’ military and police are perfect, but demonising them never was a solution to those gaps. The key lay in recommending solutions and charting a pathway forward to achieving a desired outcome. Sadly the Yellowtards chose a destructive approach instead, anchoring their thinking on the past and launching their demonisation campaign. Both this fixation on the past and this repeated slander of the police and military have since become their trademark position. The only real beneficiaries of such a shortsighted campaign were the communists and other organisations that rely on terrorism as a pillar of their strategic agendas.
We now see the results of decades of withering assault on the country’s state forces mounted by the Yellowtards and communists. The Philippines’ military and police forces are weak and underdeveloped, routinely disrespected, and woefully underfunded. The fact that the country’s elite cocoon themselves within fortified gated communities and that private security is a billion-peso industry in the Philippines are testaments to the flaccid state of the country’s police and armed forces. The Yellowtards together with the communists in cahoots with the Philippines’ mass media industry (including virtually all of university campus “journalism”) have effectively created an environment that not only breeds but coddles terrorists. It has also created a sissy culture where victimisation is a key criterion to being regarded as a “hero”, where dead relatives are made platforms upon which dishonest political careers are launched, and where being a sissy is regarded as a “woke” virtue.
Filipinos need to put an end to the sissy culture being propagated by the Yellowtards and the communists. Look at all the world’s greatest nations. They are nations built by the sword and have blood-soaked histories of conquest and warfare. That the Philippines has no history of ever having won a war and, for that matter, altogether lacks any semblance of a martial tradition says a lot about its national character. Clearly, the Yellowtards and the communists are roadblocks to greatness. It’s time the Filipinos take decisive action against these cultural and political cancers that seek to embed defeatist mindsets and breed sheep-like people.",Politics
Leni Robredo keeps proving what a big FAKE she is,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/leni-robredo-keeps-proving-what-a-big-fake-she-is/,"If there is something current “vice president” Leni Robredo has so far proven, it is that she is a good performer. Her most recent PR stunt in which she delivered her “recommendations” on ways to improve the “fight” versus the coronavirus came across as a pretty competent stage act that left her fans gushing. Unfortunately, all it really proved is that Robredo can read but not necessarily lead.
After all, she went into what seemed to be the finer details around “restarting the economy”, “budget utilisation”, and “reporting of data” — fields of expertise that clearly go way beyond her known expertise in the fields of “human rights” lawyering. Indeed, considering that she delves into fields that vex even the most competent of administrators in these times of COVID-19 pandemic, it seems pretty premature or too much of a jumping-of-the-gun to be praising evidently scripted words coming from a “vice president” who could barely string together a sentence in straight English.
In mounting these quaint stunts, Robredo plays into an easy — even exploitative — space. Filipinos are renowned for their inability to tell the difference between the fictious character played by an actor on TV and in the movies and the actual real-life character of said actor. This is the reason many actors make it big in Philippine politics. Look no further than the likes of Senators Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla, among others, not to mention Joseph “Erap” Estrada who actually bagged the presidency in 1998 and Fernando “Ang Panday” Poe Jr who came disturbingly close to achieving the same in 2004. As such, the manner with which even the top Opposition “thought leaders” latch on to someone like Robredo who has no proven track record in executive leadership nor, at the very least, administration comes across as a bit daft.
Reading off a script certainly does not prove much. For that matter, the shape-shifter style with which Robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the 2016 elections to the present has got PR written all over it. When one does not have a stable political platform upon which to deliver one’s messaging to one’s constituents and, instead, relies on prompts from PR consultants, one tends to simply bob up and down on a sea of public opinion and, as such, come across as pathetically inconsistent.
There is a place for PR-driven public messaging and that is during election campaigns. Robredo has obviously not matured beyond the same campaign-mode her rabidly partisan followers seem to expect her to sustain. This is not appropriate given that she has been warming the “vice president” seat for the past four years now and is part of the government she presumably contributes her ideas to. If her supporters see the media stunt-like manner with which Robredo trumpets her “recommendations” as a successful indictment of the Philippine government’s efforts to do its job, she is on the hook to correct that perception if one assumes that she delivers these recommendations not to make her government look bad but to genuinely contribute to its success.
The question to Robredo therefore is, what is the real intent of her delivering her recommendations to the media first rather than to her own government in the first instance? The answer to that question is what will ultimately be the real test of whether Leni Robredo is fit to lead the Filipino people. Evidently being able to read alone just doesn’t cut it.",Politics
Filipinos are sick of having Ninoy Aquino nostalgia shoved down their throats,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/filipinos-are-sick-of-having-ninoy-aquino-nostalgia-shoved-down-their-throats/,"Another uneventful August 21 has passed once again proving that the Ninoy Aquino magic has not only faded, it’s been utterly crushed. The dawn of the death anniversary this year of the late former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr saw the hashtag #NinoyIsNotAHero “trend” on Twitter. Margaret Claire Layug reported via GMA News Online that “[as] of 9 a.m. Friday, the hashtag was third on Philippine trends with more than 13,000 tweets talking about it.”
Layug quotes the “expert” De La Salle University professor Jason Cabañes who had this to say…
“I think it speaks to one shared narrative about the Philippines that has gained some traction in recent years: the failure of EDSA and its resultant oligarchic democracy,” Cabañes told GMA News Online.
“More worrisomely, it speaks to a broader shared narrative about how maybe democracy isn’t working and that maybe we should be like our neighbouring countries. They may be more authoritarian, but they seem to be doing better than us,” he added.
“I think this is something that we should challenge by offering new shared narratives about the value of democracy for our society. But [it] needs to be something that resonates with people. We can’t keep coming back to previous stories that people seem to have rejected,” he continued.
Evidently the Philippine Opposition still don’t get this and continue to latch on to the obsolete narrative and fail to evolve.
How do the Philippines’ Opposition camps expect to return to power legally if they continue to hang on to a political cliché that no longer resonates with the Filipino people? This is the challenge the Opposition need to step up to: to reshape themselves under a winnable brand — a task made doubly difficult by an Old Guard of “thought leaders” who stubbornly continue to believe the Aquino brand is still the old political Midas Touch of yore.
Herein is the current reality the Philippines’ opposition camps need to face. Nobody is “afraid” of Ninoy Aquino. No politician who is serious about running in the next election will touch the narrative with a ten-foot-pole. Indeed, even the bloc within the Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan — a.k.a. the Yellowtards — no longer even sport the Aquinos’ political colours.
Indeed, the biggest casualty of this baffling devotion to a failed ideology is none other than former Secretary Mar Roxas whose failure to bag the presidency for the Yellowtards back in 2016 contributed to paving the way for the ascent to power of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Something’s gotta give. Actually, it already has. Ninoy Aquino is no longer the winnable symbol of the Philippines’ chi chi political camps. It’s time the Opposition come up with a new narrative that looks to the future and lets go of a history they dishonestly wrote for themselves.",Politics
Battle of the Heroes: NAIA name change vs. Ferdinand Marcos Day,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/battle-of-the-heroes-naia-name-change-vs-ferdinand-marcos-day/,"Whether you refer to heroes here as with or without the quotation marks, “heroes” in the Philippines appear to be defined by how well you can get history to side on you. And what better way to do that than name recall? So for anyone wanting to be remembered as a hero, naming roads and public buildings, erecting statues and commemorating special days are just about the most effective techniques in the country. But why is this important? Well, just ask the descendants of these heroes who are out to benefit during election day.
It looks like the tide is turning these days with Ninoy increasingly being portrayed as a fake hero, traitor and terrorist (dying only in pursuit of his political agenda), while Macoy is steadily gaining ground in cementing his legacy as the genuine contributor to the country’s development and progress as World War II veteran, distinguished legislator, and former president.
No less than presidential son Paolo Duterte (along with 2 other Congressmen) is authoring the bill in Congress to rename NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) into anything but after the Yellow Icon. House Bill 7031 seeks to change the airport’s name to the Paliparang Pandaigdig ng Pilipinas.
This move has been met with mixed reactions across the spectrum of minds: Filipinos who have snapped out of the Yellow spell welcome this with a resounding Amen, with a sigh of relief that their clamor for this is finally being heard.
One netizen, Jun Dx2, had these kind words to say…
I don’t care what they rename NAIA with but just remove the name of that fake hero, yellowshit patriarch and co-founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines out!
But as to the timing of doing this in the midst of a pandemic, Senator Risa Hontiveros reacted:
branding the proposal as “ill-timed and insensitive” would be an “understatement.”
Meanwhile Top Yellow Honcho of the Land, Leni Robredo, had a clanging tricycle-load of Taglish to unleash:
“Nasa gitna tayo ng pandemya, ito pa talaga ang maiisip natin?”
“Where is our sense of history?”
“Ngayon pa talaga kung kailan dapat all hands on deck tayo na nagtutulong-tulong para masugpo ‘yung pandemya, ngayon pa ‘yan iisipin?”
Did they ever consider that re-branding the former winner of “Worst Airport of the Year” Awards towards a positive image at a time when our tourism is at its bleakest is actually good timing and a great marketing opportunity in anticipation of our reopening to the world?
On the other side of the court, the House had just stamped their approval on a bill declaring Sept. 11 ‘President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos Day’ in Ilocos Norte, which makes it a special nonworking holiday in the North to commemorate the birth anniversary of the former president.
Senator Sotto affirmed he would not object to the measure:
former President Marcos was a son of Ilocos Norte and he remains, to this day, a hero not only to the people of Ilocos Norte but also to most Ilocanos all over the world.
He expects the bill such as this with local application to breeze through the Senate.
Apparently at the end of the day a person will be measured by his/her accomplishments and achievements, and not by how many people one has duped into following his “the Filipino is worth dying for” Cult.
Considering the steep fall from the heyday of Yellow euphoria to the sheer shame of getting labelled a Dilawan or Yellowtard these days, all Ninoy and Cory can probably say at this point is “It was good while it lasted!”",Politics
Marcos Day represents the Filipino people’s moving on from a manufactured past,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/marcos-day-represents-the-filipino-peoples-moving-on-from-a-manufactured-past/,"When a small minority of “activists” continue to encourage Filipinos to latch on to the past and sustain a pathological anxiety about the future, you know there is something wrong. Even more wrong is when these shills conspire with Big Corporate Media to propagate their sick “cause”. Today’s Inquirer editorial, for example, cites, interestingly enough, two communists to try to convince its readers that a “bill declaring a holiday in the province of Ilocos Norte to commemorate the birth of former president and ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos” constitutes a “desecration” of history.
Actually, to lend some ascendancy to that pompous statement and title of his piece, the Inquirer Editor makes it clear that he merely echoes the words of the communist and Bayan Muna “representative” Eufemia Cullamat whose precise words were that the move was a “big desecration of our history”. And perhaps to score additional Woke Bingo points, all this, the Inquirer Editor shrieks, is but the “latest repugnant attempt at historical revisionism”.
Next, the Inquirer Editor cites Etta Rosales who is “chair emerita of the party list Akbayan and former chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)” as someone who “knows whereof she speaks”. But of course. Rosales was, after all, a “political detainee during the martial law years”. As expected, anyone who was in prison during those years is automatically a “hero” and some sort of revered authority figure on all things to do with “human rights” which, we Filipinos have been indoctrinated into believing, is anathema to anything to do with Marcos.
The national butthurt these Martial Law Crybabies want to keep all Filipinos mired in goes to such extent that it does not occur to the Inquirer Editor himself that the words of a bunch of communists do not, in any way, represent the broader opinion of the Filipino public. Indeed, this latest fluff piece that panders to the obsolete howls of these crybabies is yet another case of minority opinions being cherry-picked to further a dishonest agenda. This is the very sort of behaviour that contributes to the now-observed progressive loss of trust in the credibility of Big Corporate Media “journalism” by the public.
Filipinos would serve themselves well by stepping out of the clunker that is the communists’ butthurt over “The Martial Law Years” and look to a future of possibilities. Rather than be trapped in a sick Cold War era rhetoric that continuously drums in what Filipinos should not be, we should start creating and embracing thinking around what we could be. Enough already of this perverse Martial Law Crybabyism the communists would like us all to be forever stuck in!",Politics
Martial Law is a hopeless he-said-she-said “issue” that only wastes our time,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/martial-law-is-a-hopeless-he-said-she-said-issue-that-only-wastes-our-time/,"I just have to agree with what Kay Rivera wrote in her Inquirer column today…
It frustrates me that we must continue to turn martial law into a he-said-she-said game of history of Marcos vs Aquino camps, a game of fallacies where condemning one must be tantamount to glorifying the other.
As she asserts and titles her piece, there is supposedly plenty of proof. Rivera asserts that “claims of human rights abuses exist, often supported by documentation” in reference to the default position her camp takes on the matter of the “injustices” allegedly perpetrated in those “Martial Law years”. Rightly so, perhaps. The trouble, it seems, is that all this “proof” and the process and institutions these have been pulled through suffer crises of credibility. At the core of this is the perception that the “dilawans” control and, as such, are seen by the broader public to have bent — even perverted — the process to suit their agendas and, most notorious of all, have conscripted the Philippines’ top Big Corporate Media enterprise to their dishonest “cause”.
Rivera then goes on to issue that all-too-familiar lament that she is, herself, tired of the topic and “weary of being falsely called ‘dilawan'”. The term dilawan refers to members of the Yellowtard bloc that claims to lead today’s Philippine Opposition. Members of this bloc are partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan whose narrative of “heroes”, necropolitics, and Victim Card playing dominated Philippine political rhetoric since the 1986 EDSA “people power revolution”. It is hardly surprising that Filipinos think the entire system is rigged in favour of the Yellowtards seeing that no less than Chito Gascon the chairman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) is a known Yellowtard who served as the campaign manager of the Yellowtard presidential candidate Mar Roxas in the lead up to the 2016 presidential elections. It also did not help their cause that the two biggest media conglomerates ABS-CBN and the Inquirer Group were both direct beneficiaries of the corporate looting that followed the “revolutionary” victory of the Yellowtards in 1986.
The “issue” Rivera gets all crybaby about, therefore, is a political one. Facts don’t matter in democratic politics as recent history has revealed. Popularity and public opinion does. This is why, back in 2012, no less than the Second Aquino Administration under former president Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III used the political tool of impeachment under a Philippine Senate “court” to crush the late former Chief Justice Renato Corona. In a political institution such as the Senate, Aquino’s prosecution team enjoyed vastly more latitude to pervert the “facts” surrounding the case and bend public opinion using the speculative “reporting” of newly-incorporated “social news network” Rappler, a “media” company many Filipinos believe was created specifically in aid of Aquino’s nefarious mission.
Herein lies the hopelessness of resolving the truth about the Martial Law “regime” of former President Ferdinand Marcos. The preferred story was told and the “facts” evaluated by the erstwhile victors of the so-called 1986 “revolution”. This preferred story was then propagated using Yellowtard-written school books, Yellowtard-chaired “human rights” commissions, communist-infiltrated student councils, communists in the editorial boards of campus newspapers, etc. It was three decades of institutionalised insults being thrown at Filipinos’ intellectual faculties perpetrated by a Communist-Yellowtard Axis.
Small wonder that this abuse actually laid the groundwork for the rise to power of the popular populist government of Rodrigo Duterte. Filipinos simply had enough of Aquino and communist BS.
The solution to this intractable state of affairs in Philippine politics is to bury the “Martial Law” rhetoric once and for all and for Filipinos to move on and embrace the possibilities of the future with fresh minds liberated from Yellowtard and communist ideology. Evidently, Inquirer columnist Kay Rivera embodies the sort of archetype that needs to be purged from the Philippine National “Debate” — the sorts of bozos that keep the conversation stuck in Martial Law Crybabyism.
As to resolving the “injustices” Rivera alleges? Well, think a moment and consider the fact that no less than the two Yellowtard presidencies of Cory and Noynoy Aquino all but failed to solve the murder of “national hero” Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. This highlights just how non-serious even the Yellowtards are about resolving the very Martial Law “injustices” people like Rivera wail about. Just give it up, kiddo. “Martial Law” is now just a quaint historical curiosity debated by “thought leaders” who have nothing better to do with their time. Meanwhile, success in the business of embracing the future will be what ultimately separate the men from the little girls.",Politics
Martial Law Crybaby Joel Pablo Salud insults Holocaust victims in arguing with Fr. Ranhilio Aquino,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/martial-law-crybaby-joel-pablo-salud-insults-holocaust-victims-in-arguing-with-fr-ranhilio-aquino/,"A certain Joel Pablo Salud recently launched into yet another one of those Martial Law Crybabyist treatises on the chi chi platform Medium. His piece “Marcos, Derrida, and a priest who should know better than to side with executioners”, is essentially a temper tantrum over a tweet issued by Fr. Ranhilio Aquino…
Aquino’s tweet had caused a stir in the Martial Law Crybaby community and got the undergarments of a who’s who of “thought leaders” twisted over the matter.
Salud presumably swoops in to save their day. He goes into a sort of irrelevant academic-style build-up towards the point he aims to make, his readers would later find out, which is essentially to debunk Aquino’s assertion. As such, the only part of his blurb where he makes some semblance of a point can be found about 20 paragraphs into it here…
Those who speak the loudest in their condemnation of Marcos HAVE experienced the atrocities of martial law. It is a blatant lie to say otherwise. The loudest of all rants and criticisms against the Marcoses come from survivors of Marcos’ holocaust. That generation, myself included, is still alive today.
Look past the easy emotional space this quaint rant plays to in the author’s tone-deaf use of words like “holocaust” (the author owes victims of real holocausts an apology there, I believe) and regard the tired argument it makes — that being a “victim” of those alleged “Martial Law atrocities” by itself is a foundation for the Martial Law Crybabyism he and his ilk would like Filipinos to remain emotionally bound to in perpetuity. Salud conveniently glosses over the reasons certain people had been targeted in any crackdown that may have happened during “the Martial Law era”. For that matter, he selectively leaves out the fact that such crackdowns were the whole point of martial laws in general to begin with. Indeed, Salud is being fundamentally dishonest by being so selective in his arguments.
Firstly, Martial Law in and by itself is not a crime. The Constitution continues to allow its legal implementation.
Second, mere circumstantial evidence links alleged atrocities and abuse committed by police and military personnel to Martial Law itself. Such atrocities and abuse occur whether Martial Law is in effect or not. And if such atrocities are perpetrated while Martial Law happens to be in effect, proving they were done because Martial Law was in effect is impossible. You can prove who committed said atrocities. But proving these people acted because of Martial Law is a futile exercise.
Third, whereas victims of terrorism are generally innocent people who have nothing to do with its perpetrators, no such generalisation could be made about alleged victims of Martial Law. Victims of terrorism are random. Alleged “victims” of Martial Law, on the other hand, are likely to have been involved in something that made them persons of interest to begin with.
Even then, Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao actually was there and attests to a common denominator that puts Martial Law “victims” into a defineable non-random set…
There were indisputably human rights violations during Martial Law, even the most despicable ones. Many of my close friends were killed by the military or the constabulary in their mid-twenties. However, I would blame Communist chief Jose Ma. Sison for many of those deaths because he deployed those men who were barely out of their teens to foment unrest and revolt in the countryside, telling them that the masses had been roused to revolution because of Martial Law. They were very poorly armed, and were killed not even by the military but by police and militias who thought they were bandits.
Historical facts are one thing. Historians’ individual narratives spun around these facts are another. Aquino’s original point was that certain narratives have been used by certain partisan camps not as a reference for an ongoing debate on these facts but as means to emotionally-blackmail Filipinos to further their dishonest political and “revolutionary” agendas. Filipinos have lost trust in a narrative that had been perverted to political ends. The behaviours on display in the manner with which partisans demonise anyone who dares challenge such belief systems are evidence that people like Salud and his ilk are not out for honest conversation and are more interested in silencing dissent.",Politics
Additional funding for Leni Robredo’s office: a case of REVERSE PORK BARREL,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/additional-funding-for-leni-robredos-office-a-case-of-reverse-pork-barrel/,"Back in the day, pork barrel — known by a variety of euphemisms like “Priority Development Assistance Fund” (PDAF) and most notorious of all, the so-called “Disbursement Acceleration Program” (DAP) — usually involved funds “allocated” by the Executive Branch to legislators. Nowadays we are seeing an even bigger perversion of this crooked accounting sleight of hand. Legislators are now mulling over delivering a similar sort of discretionary funding to the Office of the Vice President (OVP).
The additional funding being considered is enormous. CNN Philippines reports that legislators are considering jacking up the budget of the OVP to one billion pesos — up from just 679 million pesos. And what would this additional funding be used for? According to the same report her office aims to “reach more pandemic-hit Filipinos”.
The OVP previously launched programs which rolled out personal protective equipment, free shuttle services, and dormitories for health workers. It also purchased coronavirus test and extraction kits which were delivered to various private and state laboratories.
Robredo’s office also recently launched the “Bayanihanapbuhay” platform to help Filipinos look for job opportunities online. For its second leg, they will launch within the week another initiative to provide opportunities for those from the micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs which earlier benefited from her anti-poverty program Angat Buhay.
Who can argue with that bit of emotional blackmail, right? But if we stop to think about this even for a minute, we will find that these are activities that fall within the remits of existing government departments and agencies such as the Departments of Social Welfare and Development, Public Works and Highways, and Health among others. One wonders then why the OVP sees itself as obliged to do jobs that are the responsibilities of other offices; considering too that these respective agencies and departments possess the in-house experience, expertise, and specialist resources to do these jobs properly and at scales that allow procurement and use of these resources efficiently.
The more important and more disturbing aspect of these sketchy budgetary wranglings is the track record of “vice president” Leni Robredo exhibits using such “services” she delivers to the public as platforms for engaging in partisan posturing and bolstering her public profile. Robredo, after all, is seen to be the “leader” of the Philippine Opposition and with national elections just around the corner, it is quite evident she is out for a bit of self-promotion on the state dime.
If it walks like pork barrel, quacks like pork barrel, and looks like pork barrel then, guess what: It very likely is pork barrel. The only difference is the gravy is flowing the other way this time — from the Legislative Branch to the Executive Branch contrary to tradition.
It is well and good that Robredo is using her office as a conduit for these “public services”. What is not clear, however, are her motives and agenda seeing that Robredo wastes no opportunity to make delivery of these “services” a big song-and-dance before the cameras of ABS-CBN, Rappler, and, of course the Inquirer. It is easy to see that this just does not make any sense as evident in the sophomoric logic her supporters use to justify these proposed budget allocations. Robredo ally Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Gabriel Bordado reportedly asserted that “the OVP received the highest audit rating from the Commission on Audit in 2019” which, if one pauses to think about it, really has nothing to do with budget decisions. Bordado insists that the OVP “has been engaging in frontline activities against COVID-19. It has also launched livelihood, education, people empowerment, and other projects throughout the country, but its budget is still the smallest in the entire bureaucracy”. Another non-sequitur. None of the “activities” Bordado cites is part of the scope of work of the OVP.
One can only conclude that the requests for more money to be thrown into the OVP are motivated by dishonest and baldly political intentions. That’s just not right.",Politics
What to expect from Duterte’s 2020 State of the Nation Address,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/what-to-expect-from-dutertes-2020-state-of-the-nation-address/,"But of course the usual mob of Opposition “activists” will defy the ban on “street protests” on Monday the 27th July 2020. But are they going to exhibit or demonstrate anything new? Quite unlikely. They will be as predictable as they’ve always been — with their “oust” rhetoric, their “human rights” blah blah, and their “looming tyranny” fear mongering among other activist clichés. By definition, newsworthiness is information that is novel or unexpected in nature. So news media outlets that deem these “protest rallies” newsworthy would be doing their viewers the usual dishonest news “reporting” on what is essentially non-news. There is nothing newsworthy about the protests expected to erupt on Monday because they will be the old same ol’.
On the other hand, the speech to be delivered by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will be the news of the day on Monday. Despite wokedom’s insistence that Duterte is the most disgusting man since Stalin, they will be hanging on to every word he utters, addicted to the high they get signalling their virtue tweeting about how disgusting every word they strain their ears to capture comes across to them. Monday’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) will be a big event indeed.
Advertisers who manage to get slots in the SONA telecast will have a field day. Wokedom after all are the iPhone-tapping, latte-sipping Starbucks barnacles whose cash flows — and, therefore, collective purchasing power — remain immune to the COVID-19-induced economic crisis that bears down on most ordinary schmoes in the Philippines. This is thanks to the old reliable Bank of Mommy and Daddy chi chi Filipino wokedom lean on to keep their extension credit cards positive-balanced and their handed-on-silver-platter jobs that lend well to working from home (home being places that are equipped with the best Internet Daddy can buy).
What is Duterte planning to share with the public on Monday? Well it depends on what sort of Filipino you are. If you are a forward-looking Filipino, you will take on board things from the SONA that inform the nature of opportunities that change brings. If you are the trapped-in-the-past sorts that the Philippine Opposition would like most Filipinos to remain as, you will see nothing but badness in what the president has to say.
At the most fundamental level, Duterte is a product of Philippine democracy — the winner of an election, overwhelmingly popular, and, as such, impervious to any legal means to removing him from office mid-term. What then do the Opposition “activists” who plan to riot on Manila’s streets on Monday want? The thing they need to ask themselves is if the antics they plan to put on exhibit on Monday will take them on a pathway to winning the coming 2022 national elections — the only true means to replace the regime with anything that resembles the leadership (and representation in Congress) that the Opposition want. They should ask themselves if Filipinos really give a rat’s ass about the nebulous notions of “human rights”, “press freedom”, and US “imperialism” that they articulate in the woefully unoriginal placards they will be brandishing on their steet parties.
Even the foremost “thought leaders” of the Opposition will be hard-pressed to stammer out an even vaguely-coherent sales pitch for their “cause” of the sort that could win them an election. Indeed, with less than two years to go and less than a year to prepare a viable campaign, this Opposition is not stepping up to the role of a competent challenge to the incumbent — one that deserves the respect of a people who aspire to become a true modern democratic people. They lack a winnable leader, lack a coherent platform, and are a hopelessly-fragmented motley lot.
If this is the Philippine Opposition we will be seeing in Manila’s streets on Monday, they will be an absolute national embarrassment. To the communists, Yellowtards, Martial Law Crybabies and the starstruck fandom of Kapamilya‘s starlets, at least try not to smile before the cameras to show you are even half serious about the joke of a “movement” you will be exhibiting.
President Duterte’s SONA will be delivered to the Filipino people on Monday, the 27th July 2020. Deal with that.",Politics
Philippine Opposition fails again to respond INTELLIGENTLY to Duterte’s 2020 SONA,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/philippine-opposition-fails-again-to-respond-intelligently-to-dutertes-2020-sona/,"The much-awaited State of the Nation Address (SONA) had come and gone and all the Opposition have to show for is a set of failed supposedly orchestrated street protests rallies. It seems the concept of “opposition” to today’s Opposition partisans does not go beyond the old mold of overused “activist” clichés that are thick on spectacle but very thin on intellectual substance. To “take a stand” is, to be fair, to make a statement. In the case of the Opposition, said statement is supposed to be in, well, opposition to whatever position the incumbent takes on an issue. Yet despite the circus that Opposition camps organised to mark the occasion of this year’s SONA on Monday, it still can’t be said that the Opposition have made themselves clear on what they really stand for.
Most of the messages expressed and symbolised in the various shows put on by “activists” in their corners of Manila’s streets didn’t reveal much of a vision for the Philippines as a nation. In short, to the important question of what they’d do differently if their lot were in power today instead of Duterte, they come out sorely lacking.
Take, for example, the two main partisan blocs that dominate the Opposition — the communists and the Yellowtards (the latter being the clique of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan). The earlier, the commies, propose nothing short of total destruction of the Philippine government. For these crooks, neither government or system of governance nor national charter legitmately frames their political aspirations. They would just as soon reduce the national government and Filipinos’ entire democratic way of life to rubble and then, upon this, build their criminal “dictatorship of the proletariat”. For the communists, every life is expendable in the “revolution” they will wage until they achieve this end.
Indeed the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) makes no secret of its drive to recruit Filipinos into their terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA) and offer no sign of considering legal pathways to achieving their ends beyond “armed revolution” that aims to “overthrow” any legitimately-elected Philippine President as this tweet shows.
At their best, the communists quite simply bore us with their Cold War era rhetoric and stuck-in-time slogans and mantras. Their cause is in bad need of modernisation.
Less deadly and by no means as murderous as communist terrorists, on the other hand, are the “woke” Yellowtards. It is interesting that this partisan bloc align themselves with the commies because it was from within this clique of private-school-educated village kids that the 1987 Constitution was forged. This is the very same Constitution that frames the legitimacy of the incumbent government that the Opposition as a whole seek to topple extra-constitutionally. Ironic, right?
What do the Yellowtards have on offer if they manage to regain power in the Philippines? Why nothing else but the same narrative of holy “heroes” and “martyrs” and their unique brand of necropolitics they used to emotionally-blackmail Filipinos into submission for 30 years since the “people power revolution” that they engineered in 1986.
Like the commies, the Yellowtards would have us believe that there continues to be a “fight” (their rallying cry is Laban! symbolised by the “L” shared hand gesture) that needs to be fought. This fight will be fought by people gathering en masse on Manila’s streets shouting “oust (insert name of ‘evil’ president here)” continuing a political franchise the precedent of which was set back in 1986. Their weapon is a naive but highly potent sense of self-righteousness made even more potent by the notion that the God of the Philippines’ state religion is on their side.
The droning “revolutionary” chants of the communists together with the shrill media-amplified “Laban” rhetoric of the Yellowtards leaves very little space for intelligent debate to compete for air time. This reality was made glaringly evident again this week both in the lead up to and in the aftermath of Duterte’s delivery of this SONA before joint sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives.
The eminent activist writer Katrina Stuart-Santiago in a lament published just a week or two before the 2020 SONA was delivered captures both the essential dysfunction and the core of the challenge the Opposition need to step up to in this snippet from her blog post “Notes on: What next? #Covid19 #TerrorLaw #Protest”…
The narrative we’re following is still that of this government’s. We’re still all just reacting to all that it does, given the nation it is building. But what if we start refusing to be part of that narrative? What if instead of simply being reactionary, we start proactively talking about the nation we would like to fashion? What if we build an alternative narrative of nation for ourselves? Maybe if we refuse government’s control over our headspace and our emotional lives, we can actually start thinking better about ways to do protest.
Indeed. You need intelligence and imagination to think outside of what is framed by the powerful, build a better narrative, and find better ways to do protest. Intelligence and imagination are evidently characteristics today’s Opposition and would-be “revolutionaries” are sorely lacking seeing the mediocre collateral they being to their “activism” and to their politics. Filipinos deserve a better more modern Opposition than this.",Politics
Leni Robredo and other Opposition leaders’ statements hinder efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/leni-robredo-and-other-opposition-leaders-statements-hinder-efforts-to-manage-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"Now that the number of COVID-19 cases has breached the 100,000 mark and calls for a renewed lockdown coming from the Philippines’ frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) are being amplified by Opposition “thought leaders”, “vice president” Leni Robredo chimes in on cue. Rappler now “reports” that Robredo “urges the government to heed the medical community’s plea for a two-week lockdown to rethink the country’s strategy in fighting the pandemic”.
Interesting that back in June, Robredo reportedly said that Extended lockdown won’t help in fight vs. COVID-19.
“I don’t think so [that extended lockdown is the solution going forward]. We have seen other countries, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, hindi ganoon kahaba ang lockdown and yet they were able to control the contramination,” Robredo said in an interview on ANC television.
“Ano ginawa nila? Sobrang aga nila nag cancel ng flights from China. Going forward, pag naghihirap ang tao, magpipilit na lumabas, at pag naghihirap ang tao, it will breed more problems than we already have,” she added.
It gets even more interesting when one considers the mass protest rallies key blocs within the Opposition — the Yellowtards (people rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists — have encouraged hundreds of thousands of Filipinos to participate in. One such rally involved a show of support for embattled media conglomerate ABS-CBN in mid-July where celebrities such as Angel Locsin used their “fandom” to rally public support and to emotionally-blackmail their colleagues in the industry into toeing the partisan line. Needless to say, these mass actions put thousands at risk of contacting COVID-19.
It is the height of hypocrisy indeed when one recalls how, back in May, ABS-CBN News reported how Locsin wouldn’t risk holding her wedding to film producer Neil Arce during lockdown.
“Kaya lang, ‘pag lockdown pa, hindi naman namin puwede i-risk, di ba? Hindi namin alam kung ano ang mangyayari,” she said.
Goes to show just how selective Opposition “thought leaders” are when considering people’s safety amidst the pandemic.
For her part, chi chi daughter of The Megastar Kakie Pangilinan herself encouraged support for similar protest circuses. Quite telling was Pangilinan’s quick and very public response to communist leader Renato Reyes’s appeal on behalf of 21 San Roque residents thrown in jail for violating government quarantine directives.
On Twitter on April 3, Frankie, the outspoken daughter of Senator Francis Pangilinan and “Megastar” Sharon Cuneta, responded to a tweet from activist and musician Renato Reyes Jr which said bail for those arrested was set at at least P15,000 each.
“Wala na nga silang makain, pagbabayarin pa ng P15,000 each (They’re already hungry, and yet they’re being made to pay P15,000,” Renato said.
“I’ll sponsor one. Please give the details,” Frankie replied. She followed up with another tweet, saying “and my parents would like to cover the other twenty.”
All nice and peachy of course for the habitual duckface-selfie olympian when the trendy thing at the moment is to signal such “virtue” without considering the fallout irresponsible behaviour like this would have on frontline HCWs. But then when the “tending” topics suddenly change and calling for renewed lockdown is the new fashion statement, so too do the tunes of the cliques of chi chi “influencers” the likes of which Pangilinan represent…
Therein lies the fundamental and evidently fatal flaw in the manner with which Filipinos manage their crisis. The authoritative nature of “information” in the Philippines is a function of how popular the messenger is and, more importantly, the nature of their relationships with media channels that have the means to amplify their quaint musings. Rather than use their better judgement people would rather wait around for the next sound byte of “wisdom” issued by their appointed “thought leaders”.
Rally pa more, lockdown pa more. It depends on what is fashionable as much as the latest designer facemasks these “influencers” would be raving about on the side in between their “socially aware” tweets.",Politics
"Staying True to their Calling, Wokes and Yellows Remain Consistent with Their Inconsistencies",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/staying-true-to-their-calling-wokes-and-yellows-remain-consistent-with-their-inconsistencies/,"In engineering, the way to assure that the design or the system works is through consistency. If the desired outcomes are consistently observed, the designer is assured of a peaceful night’s sleep.
At the start of the design process, it is expected that the output will be random and all over the place. That’s normal. Over time however, after a few iterations and calibration, a pattern will emerge. That’s predictability. It is extremely important because it is the only indication that the system or the design is working out fine.
The problem begins when the expected response becomes erratic after calibration. When that happens, it is certain that something is wrong.
The same can be applied to wokes and the Yellowtards. Their consistent inconsistencies that they are exhibiting are indications of hypocrisy, and double/triple even multiple standards.
They specialize in cherry-picking and moulding current issues to fit their narratives while ignoring facts that will tear apart their faulty arguments. You have to admire however, their persistence in making these episodes on social media on a regular basis such that the usual initial reactions of anger and eye-rolls can now be replaced with a grin and/or a chuckle.
One example of their hypocrisies are those who irresponsibly insisted on organizing rallies despite of them being fully aware that rallies are perfect grounds for transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Recently, they joined the popular cry to give the medical frontliners their much needed timeout to recharge.
Risa Hontiveros in a previous interview with Arnold Clavio cried foul over the sexism and “slut-shaming” of her fellow senator Leila Delima during the congress hearings, and yet she wasn’t able to utter anything sensible when asked about her reaction regarding Ronnie Dayan’s legal wife being hurt as the illicit relationship unfolded on national TV.
Defenders of the now defunct ABS-CBN franchise used emotional blackmail against the government particularly the congressmen on the alleged 11,000 workers that will be displaced. And yet these defenders were eerily silent when the network sought every means necessary to delay the just compensation of Weng Hidalgo. Same with the issue of technical personnel who filed labor malpractice against the network and won. Were there any mass gatherings conducted to air their support and to condemn the clear violation of their rights?
Some Catholic priests who allowed themselves to be prostituted by politics even wished for the president to get sick (and only God knows who else are on their wish list).
Those and a lot more, just to name a few.
The problem with being inconsistent, is that it raises red flags with sensible observers. Instead of making their arguments sound to convince the public, they continued to hurl insults to the majority (an overwhelming majority, based on surveys) by tagging them as “bobo”. And as such, they drove the final nails to their political coffins as the silent majority voted them out in the recent elections.
Disillusionment is but one of the many problems with having multiple moralities instead of calling a spade a spade whether it’s in ones’ favor or not. Another is you need to keep track of how you stand on different issues, which has become a constant stumbling block for Leni Robredo. And she drew a lot of flak already from the very people they desperately needed on their side.
That’s where we need to check our own biases and be consistent to call out what’s wrong even if it means confronting the very people who are on the same page as ours. This is especially true for the opposition and their woke supporters if they want to stay relevant and not be perpetually viewed as clowns and nuisance. Because inconsistency is a stink, an indication that something is rotten from within. And it isn’t something that’s going to help the country nor the Liberal Party’s dream of getting back to power.",Politics
"Thank Ninoy for the holiday, I guess",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/thank-ninoy-for-the-holiday-i-guess/,"The greatest “heroic” act Ninoy Aquino did was to die face down on the tarmac of the Manila International Airport. Other than that, he was all optics and hot air, reminiscent of the vice-president today.
He didn’t die for the Filipinos, he died for his ambition. And it paid off for his wife and son.
Even his death was suspect. At the time, he was already dying from a heart condition. He refused to get treatment here, fearing Marcos’ “duplicity” which might get him killed through some medical “accident.”
And if he was indeed dying, then he was deemed better dead “assassinated” than dying from a heart attack. It’s good publicity.
There was no subsequent investigation on his death. The “investigations” all stopped abruptly and one Rolando Galman was pointed as gunman and Marcos as mastermind.
So here’s the thing: Marcos–let’s admit to it–was a brilliant man. Would it be really logical for someone like him to kill his most bitter political opponent at a time when the opposition is gaining ground and when he was gaining more and more enemies day-by-day?
I am no Marcos supporter, but really, things don’t add up.
Here’s some truth, though: Ninoy was no hero. Far from it. History is the ultimate judge and his purported legacy is being judged harshly.
Still, I guess we have to thank him for the one day holiday.",Politics
The DISHONEST blame-Duterte-for-the-COVID-19-pandemic platform of the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/the-dishonest-blame-duterte-for-the-covid-19-pandemic-platform-of-the-philippine-opposition/,"The most overused “dissent” template of the Philippine Opposition is that the “(insert issue name here) issue” is the fault of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Because this has been used over and over again and applied to just about every problem besetting the Philippines, it has become less and less effective. If the Opposition hadn’t noticed yet, their campaign to make the ABS-CBN franchise denial out to be of Duterte’s doing did not fly. Some time ago Chief Opposition “Economist” and Rapplerette JC Punongbayan even tried to pin the blame for a rise in inflation on Duterte. Punongbayan’s boss Rappler CEO Maria Ressa, for her part, made a name for herself in Western liberal circles selling the notion that her legal troubles were engineered by the Duterte “regime”.
In recent months, the world’s biggest problem, the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the Philippine Opposition’s current flavour of the month. Their position on the matter of that pandemic is, guess what, that its runaway spread across the Philippines (now suffering the highest number of reported cases in southeast Asia) is Duterte’s fault too. Let’s see how that one flies over the long stretch. Given the Opposition’s track record of failure playing the “it’s the incumbent’s fault” card, it is unlikely that this position will be winning them any elections anytime soon either.
So desperate is the Opposition for emotional hooks to throw at the Filipino public that their blame-Duterte rhetoric has started to plumb embarrassing lows. Activists have even started to blame Duterte for a spate of runaway animals spotted in various Philippine cities!
To be fair, governments and presidencies go on to be defined by the problems and crises they oversee (or fail to oversee). The trouble with the Opposition is that they fail to exhibit a pitch to Filipino voters that goes beyond exploiting that — something that will eventuate anyway. Rather than build a platform of alternatives and solutions on the back of those problems and crises, today’s Opposition remain stuck in a mind-numbing blame platform that had long ago worn thin. In short, to the question of what it is exactly the Opposition expect Filipinos to look to them for, one can only shrug. The Opposition offer no pathway forward. They offer nothing because they lack any semblance of a compelling vision for the Philippines to begin with. All they and their foremost “thought leaders” do is blame.
The Opposition, to its credit, are learning some lessons albeit rather slowly. The “activist” Mong Palatino on Bulatlat writes, “It is not enough to boost social media influence and make it in the trending topics of the day; our actions must be powerful enough that it becomes a traumatic experience for despotic authorities. They must feel it in realtime and force them to reconsider their remaining time in office.” Impressive work learning that lesson, genius. The trouble with that epiphany is that it is an incomplete one. The most important lesson of all still eludes guys like Palatino — Winning National Elections 101.
It is either the Opposition are (1) too stupid to learn that lesson or (2) have no plans of seizing power legally to begin with. On the basis of the latter, there may be reason to excuse Palatino specifically seeing that he is a communist writing for a communist journal. Communists after all don’t aspire to acquire political power legally. Then again, a bit to the communists’ right on the political spectrum sit the Yellowtards, that bloc of rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan. They too are addicted to extra-constitutional means to seizing power what with their “people power” narrative being at the core of their ideology.
All of those are not working, folks. It’s time you people evolve or reinvent yourselves. Filipinos will decide in 2022. Or maybe they will decide while staring down the business end of an AK-47 if Palatino’s and Bulatlat‘s principals’ “revolution” succeeds and their vision of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” is realised. Oh wait… turns out they actually do have a vision for the Philippines after all.",Politics
Leaders are overrated; and the myth of one-man rule,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/leaders-are-overrated-henchmen/,"Some people still say the solution to the Philippines’ problems is choosing the right leader. That’s the very mindset that led the country down to the dumps.
The problem is that leaders are treated as a “silver bullet” or quick do-it-all solution. Filipinos believe that the leader will do everything for them, including clearing the nation of corruption. This is their Juan Tamad nature at work.
People who insist on choosing the right leader are often either the promoters of propaganda and long-time fallacies that have been used throughout history to dupe people, or are themselves duped.
The shills will often promote their own leader as the right leader for all. They will warn you against “bad leaders,” insisting that these are the cause of society’s downfall. They will also attack these supposed “bad leaders” (who are actually just their competition), even if these are actually more qualified or are doing something right. Some even name business leaders as proof that there is such a thing as a right leader, such as Jack Welch or Steve Jobs. I will however puncture that balloon later.
One source of the problem, as I attacked in an earlier article, is the idea that are “born” leaders. All they need is figure out who the born leader is, then support them and all will be well. If they found they got the wrong leader, just oust and oust until they get the “right” or “born” leader.
As reality has demonstrated, that’s not how it works. Leadership and character are not inborn traits; they are learned.
Let me recall another point in another earlier article: Leaders never do it alone. There are always the henchmen. That’s why I believe the idea of “one-man rule” is ridiculous and never was true. It is doubtful Ferdinand Marcos went out and killed people himself. He gave orders and the other people did it. It’s funny how many people keep on screaming against Marcos and say little to nothing against the people, who were formerly under Marcos’ command, who actually killed others (and who were also retained!).
In fact, it has been suggested that henchmen are the actual ones in control of the country. If corruption is to be eliminated from the country, there are a lot to take out, not just the Marcoses.
So successful leaders aren’t the only source of success in companies; “henchmen” are also a part of it. Jack Welch could not have made his plans for General Electric successful without willing “henchmen” in the company. Steve Jobs could not have made Apple successful without Steve Wozniak and other people, including investors. Saying leaders are single-handedly responsible for success is a huge exaggeration.
This talk about leaders is relevant for the recent martial law anniversary. The wokes (including the opposition) who scream “never forget martial law” and similar that were probably the types who’d thought, we got the wrong leader, so oust him and we’ll get a new one. The problem is, the new one did the same thing (Mendiola massacre). Regime change didn’t – and really doesn’t – bring any change to society at all.
That also should have broken the harebrained impression that Marcos is the source of all things evil and getting rid of it will make the country all good. Today, Marcos is long gone, but murders, disappearances and all manner of heinous crimes still happen. The Marcos family having some power right now doesn’t count. Other people do evil acts by themselves without their influence.
The wokes also scream Marcos this, Marcos that. In a way, it is an admission of defeat because they show by screaming at a dead body that they are unable to take down the corrupt who are still living. I also wonder if they’ve screamed at the commies who also murder a lot of people and take “revolutionary taxes” from people and businesses in the country.
If the behavior of even “little leaders” in barangays (like the enforcers who beat up a vendor in Manila), local governments and even private sector situations including hobby groups shows, the problem is not leaders, but culture. The corrupt behavior that Filipinos manifest whether as leaders or constituents is a product of culture.
Filipinos often like to suck up to “leaders” because they are expecting dole-outs. Filipinos in positions often like to steal from the resources entrusted to them. Filipinos want impunity from the consequences of their actions because they are “kawawa” or pitiful. Filipinos when presented with a chance to exploit someone helpless, like a little kid, a lonely lady or a frail old person, will go in for the kill. All of this is part of our country’s culture, as in the actual practice of people.
This is why, aside from my point that the country will not benefit from the “right” leaders, the country was not brought down by bad leaders. It was brought down by bad culture.
If we want to get rid of corruption – as well as choices of bad leaders – change in the culture, right down to the grassroots, needs to be done.
We don’t need the “right” leaders or any other such bozos. People just need to shape their own lives up. They should be responsible for themselves and not dump responsibility on their “leader.” Filipinos need to accept that “ayuda” or dole-outs is not an entitlement or right. These are important parts of culture change.
The goal is to make leaders irrelevant. If people are responsible for themselves, they don’t need leaders. In fact, one of the best things a true leader does is to show his people how to continue without him. In other words, a good leader knows how to make himself eventually irrelevant.
Leaders be damned. Some people have lived and some communities have thrived without them. Perhaps we need to reevaluate the value and impact of leaders throughout history, because it occurs to me that these have been grossly overstated.",Politics
The insanity in allowing communists to roam free in the Philippines must STOP!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/the-insanity-in-allowing-communists-to-roam-free-in-the-philippines-must-stop/,"One of the most baffling things about the Philippines’ political landscape is the continued existence of the communists. No matter how much evidence is on exhibit proving that the communists are the leaders of the terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) and that this “army” have it as their sole mission to kill Filipino soldiers and police officers and overthrow the government, there seems to be no wherewithal in either the government or the Filipino people overall to do something about this cancer. No matter how much evidence exists to prove direct links between “legal fronts” such as Anakbayan, Gabriela, Bayan Muna, the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), and the League of Filipino Students (LFS) among many others, to this terrorism that the communists espouse, it seems Filipinos and their security forces seem pretty ok allowing these elements to roam free and spread their virulent extremist ideology. Indeed, most astonishing of all, communists have just about taken full control of campus student councils and campus “journalism” in the Philippines’ biggest and most prestigious universities. Filipino parents seem to be ok with that too.
Why do Filipinos continue to tolerate these parasites? Why do Filipino parents not seem to be disturbed that communists infest their kids’ schools? Why do Filipino voters continue to allow these communist cells masquerading as “party lists” to put “representatives” in Congress seats funded by taxpayers? It seems the Philippines suffers a form of national insanity that makes its people seemingly oblivious to this massive tapeworm colony that stains their politics red from within.
Presidential Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy wrote in her article “The poisoned pen of Tonyo Cruz” how Cruz and a cadre of seemingly legit Opposition “thought leaders” routinely go about building their public personas on a platform of lies — supposedly denying that they support NPA terrorism yet making no apologies about being members — even leaders — of the Communist Party’s vassal “legal” fronts.
…you can never take away the NPA component of the CPP-NPA-NDF. The overthrow of the government through violent means is at the very core of this terrorist group.
Are Tonyo Cruz, Inday Varona, Nonoy Espina, Renato Reyes,Teddy Casiño, Carol Araullo NPA members?
No, they’re not.
They are members of the CPP-NPA-NDF, however, and have consciously and willingly agreed to the overthrow of the government. Carol Aurallo is a central party committee member of the CPP-NPA-NDF, for instance.
Interestingly, no amount of communism seems to prevent these personalities from hobnobbing with a who’s-who of chi chi oligarchs and their political and media lapdogs. What is even more astounding is the blatantly selective nature of their public schmoozing — prefering the company of the prayerful set associated with the Opposition bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards).
Hypocrisy is, of course, the least of the crimes of these communist honchos though the company they keep does raise questions around their loyalties. Are they really pro-worker? Or do these bozos turn pro-management behind the gates of the chi chi subdivisions that host the soirees they attend on weekends? Regardless of whose weddings these people grace, the fact is, they shamelessly associate themselves with parties and groups that are ok with terrorism. That’s not being woke. That’s just plain being crooked.
Why so Filipinos continue to tolerate these crooks? The mystery persists.",Politics
Duterte’s record-breaking 91% approval rating adds insult to the injury of Robredo’s dismal showing,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/dutertes-record-breaking-91-approval-rating-adds-insult-to-the-injury-of-robredos-dismal-showing/,"As usual, the Yellowtards are again in denial over the reality of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s popularity. Their arguments range from idiotic (outright claiming that the Pulse Asia survey that recently revealed this fact is fraudulent) to sour-grapey (survey results don’t solve world hunger). The fact remains that the first approval survey this since COVID-19 hit showed Duterte enjoys a 91 percent approval rating — up from 87 percent reported in December 2019.
This is the first approval ratings report on the government since then and, over that period, it is evident that the Philippine Opposition had seen the COVID-19 pandemic as a blessing to their agenda to seize power — illegally if necessary. In July of this year, Opposition-slanted “social news network” Rappler published a “report” authored by a certain Loreben Tuquero on how this blessing might impact Duterte’s popularity. Tuquero wrote back then that the “experts” predicted that “public favor for the Duterte administration may run out as Filipinos take the brunt of the oncoming economic recession”. Tuquero went on to cite various studies that point to “plummeting” optimism in the Filipino public as the effects of the COVID-19 bore down upon them. Suffice to say, the Opposition were very likely counting on this to crush Duterte’s popularity.
Like the typical Rappler “report”, the expected cast of selected “experts” spring from out of the woodwork…
According to [University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) political science professor Aries Arugay], the rise in pessimism may mean that the tolerance accorded to Duterte by Filipinos may run out, since the base that is their economic and material well-being has been taken away.
One would hope, right? That is the hope, at least, if you are a Yellowtard (that bloc of partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan who presume to “lead” the Opposition) salivating over the prospect of another “people power” coup. This, UP Professor Arugay all but confirms, is where the Yellowtard hope lies…
“[Kung] nagugutom ka, kung wala kang trabaho, kung hindi ka nabibigyan ng ayuda, kung nahihirapan ka pumunta sa work, kung kailangan mong maglakad nang 30 minutes to one hour kasi nga wala nang jeep, will you still tolerate the administration?” Arugay said in a phone interview.
(If you are hungry, if you are jobless, if you are not being given subsidy, if you find it difficult to go to work, if you need to walk 30 minutes to one hour because there are no jeeps, will you still tolerate the administration?)
Given all this “hope” drummed up by the official Yellowtard newsletter, it becomes clear why, today, faced with this much-awaited Pulse Asia report showing Duterte being even more popular, it becomes understandable why Opposition leaders are gnashing their teeth and issuing bitter indictments of its authors. To its credit, Rappler highlighted in its sobering “report” on this Pulse Asia survey outcome (authored by a certain Paterno Esmaquel II) the dismal peformance of presumptive Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo.
In contrast to Duterte, opposition leader Vice President Leni Robredo – often compared to New Zealand’s acclaimed Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern – got the second to the lowest rating among the 5 top officials in the Pulse Asia survey.
Robredo, while heaping praises for her projects and messaging during the pandemic, got a performance rating of 57%. This is a 1% drop from her 58% rating in December 2019.
Beating Robredo in terms of popularity ratings were Senate President Vicente Sotto III with 84%, and Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano with 70%.
Ouch!
In light of this, Ateneo de Manila University research fellow and Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco was evidently so moved as to tweet, “In the middle of a pandemic, the success of a president should be measured in terms of lives and livelihoods – not approval ratings.”
True perhaps. Then again the Philippines is a democracy and one where heads of government are directly elected by popular vote. So one can “measure” a president “in terms of lives and livelihoods” all they want but, ultimately, what determines who gets to be boss is popularity. When a statistically-sound study reveals that 91 percent of Filipinos “approve” of the incumbent, guess what: the only real sensible thing a truly intelligent Opposition could do is come up with a strategy to become more popular by the time the next national elections come around the corner. There’s still time to do that but not much. So, rather than accumulate kulangot in their noses sighing about “lives and livelihoods”, the Opposition’s top “thought leaders” should best be spending their limited time figuring that out.",Politics
The Opposition modus operandi: Hyping one OUTRAGE FAD after another,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/the-opposition-modus-operandi-hyping-one-outrage-fad-after-another/,"What exactly is the Opposition platform? What do they propose to be the alternative path to the way being shown to Filipinos by current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? If we are to believe, as today’s Opposition partisans would have us believe, that the Duterte Way is all bad, what proposal for a different path is on the table?
These are questions that any decent political opposition would be expected to answer even during impromptu ambush interviews. But no. The top Opposition “thought leaders” are too busy sniffing around for the next outrage fad around which they would whip up the all-too-familiar media circus they had become famous for.
The Opposition owes this rather primitive character of theirs to the Yellowtards. The Yellowtards are the bloc of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan and are the purveyors of the renowned victimhood narrative that started with the assassination of former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr in 1983. In the ensuing several decades since then, necropolitics — a national mythology spun around martyred “heroes” and the hapless “oppressed” — dominated the character of the National Debate and, in the process, intellectually-bankrupted Philippine politics.
Thus, the usual epicentre of the typical Yellowtard-inspired outrage fad of the week is some sort of “victim” that is elevated to the national stage with the support of Big Corporate Media organisations that are all too happy to join the victimhood circus. The key message of the messaging and propaganda that coagulates around these fads is, what else, the badness and “evil” of the incumbent government. The aim is by all intents and purposes criminal at its core: to incite rebellion under the guise of a fight against the “evil” strawman put up by Yellowtard “activists”.
Like the average Kapamilya starlet, Celebrity Victims come, soak in their 15 minutes of fame, then go when a rally whipped up around them fizzles. They are the stars of a perverse sort of victim porn that the Yellowtards have become prolific producers of. One wonders, however, if they continue to attract a big enough audience for their dishonest “documentary” teleseryes. See, the key to a successful TV show or movie franchise lies in their cast of characters and how potent they are as emotional hooks. Evidently victim porn “heroes” no longer get the job done for the Yellowtards and even less so for the communists whose efforts at parading one stiff after another before the Filipino people now consistently fail to draw their attention away from the latest K-pop or Korean tele-drama craze.
With national elections just around the corner, the million dollar question is increasingly relevant:
What sort of Opposition do Filipinos deserve?
For now the only answer to that is a negative one: Not the one we are seeing today.
Not one that remains fixated on necropolitics. Not one that seeks to incite sedition rather than inspire collaboration. Not one that lacks a vision for the Filipino people. It’s time Filipinos put their collective foot down and demand achievers rather than mere victims.",Politics
Opposition pleas to “remember” the “horrors” of the “Martial Law Years” starting to sound pathetic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/opposition-pleas-to-remember-the-horrors-of-the-martial-law-years-starting-to-sound-pathetic/,"Listen. Can you hear that? It’s the sound of the wailings of the Martial Law Crybabies. One wonders why they need to wax crybaby ad nauseum over the “horrors” of them “Martial Law Years” to anyone who cares to listen when they’ve already spent hundreds of millions of pesos on monuments, statues, two Aquino presidencies, and even on entire broadcast media mega-corporations to channel their narrative to the Filipino public. Still all that isn’t enough. Instead of these investments yielding returns in the form of eliciting awe and reverence in Filipinos, they have become mere punchlines in the ongoing joke that is the Opposition Yellowtard “platform”.
The latest toy the Martial Law Crybabies now crow about is the so-called “Freedom Memorial Museum” to be constructed in the chi chi Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines.
“We want to translate the story of the martial law era into the architectural design, to give meaning and experience during martial law. It’s not our architecture, it’s the architecture of the Filipino people and our history,” [one of its architects Mark Anthony Pait] said.
One wonders though. Shouldn’t the design be depicting the iconic “L” hand gesture of the Yellowtard “cause” rather than a fist that tends more to be associated to the personal brand of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? Then again who am I to comment on architectural concepts, right? The more important point here is this is just another new edifice commemorating the “brutal” government of former President Ferdinand Marcos and, of course, the “heroism” of the late former Senator Ninoy Aquino Jr seeing that “the restored Aviation Security Command (Avsecom) military van which brought Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.’s body to the hospital will serve as the museum’s centerpiece.” But of course, right?
The real measure of how effective these “reminders” are will, of course, be how many votes the Martial Law Crybabies will be attracting come 2022. As with most elections, this is an important one. The Yellowtards will be running on the usual “No to Tyranny” platform and will likely draw political capital from these icons and monuments. Good luck with that. Perhaps it might help to at least include alternatives and solutions to the Opposition proposition. Then again that’s all too hard. Spending a million bucks — or ten — on another Yellowtard “memorial” is way easier.",Politics
The Philippines’ lame duck Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/the-philippines-lame-duck-opposition/,"This is why the Philippine Opposition, led by the old bloc of partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) lose. Rather than pause for a bit of introspection in light of the recent Pulse Asia survey that revealed the record 91 percent approval rating Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys and the dismal 57 percent rating “vice president” Leni Robredo suffers, Opposition partisans remain adamant about their blessedness.
It is evident that they are not doing anything right. Under the leadership of the Liberal Party, they suffered a catastrophic loss in the 2019 congressional elections with all eight members of their main coalition failing to win a seat in the Philippine Senate. Throughout Duterte’s term since winning the presidency in 2016, the Yellowtards’ top “thought leaders” assured one another that public confidence in Duterte’s leadership will wane. They embraced the COVID-19 pandemic as their saving grace, counting on this disaster to crush Filipinos’ spirits enough to turn them away from their president and pave the way for another illegal “people power” revolution.
Despite all that, despite the incessantly lame political stunts and media circuses mounted by Robredo, their presumptive “leader”, Duterte’s popularity bulged rather than dented.
The Opposition in its current form don’t measure up as the political counter-force to the incumbent that Filipinos deserve. As such, they are a disservice to the public and Philippine democracy. After all, a healthy democracy is one where healthy tension between incumbent and opposition parties result in an intelligent national debate where the best arguments emerge victorious. We see none of that because the top Yellowtard “thought leaders” merely react to the latest “trending” flypaper issue while their communist sidekicks chant their obsolete Cold War era “anti imperialist” slogans. Not a very inspiring lot.
If we were to point out the one thing that would best symbolise the state of the Philippine Opposition, all fingers will likely be directed to “vice president” Leni Robredo. Unintelligent, uncharismatic, inarticulate, and, worst of all, inauthentic, Robredo is the curse that keeps the Philippine Opposition inutile. If the Opposition were a truly professional organisation focused on results, they would have by now put Robredo’s head on the chopping block. Political leaders in a democracy, after all, are expected to convert voters — by being persuasive in their firey speeches, by being the role models that people will find honour in following, and by being true to who they really are and not a pathetic chameleon that frantically tests different colours in a futile on-going effort to please everyone.
It is ironic that the words “Laban” (fight) and “Hold the line!” came to be associated with the Yellowtards. They are anything but the force of fighting men and women who do those words justice. All they will ever be if they continue to subject themselves to lame leaders like Robredo and two-bit aging campus “activists” is the quaint curiosity that they are today. No amount of flashing Hunger Games salutes, waving red flags emblazoned with hammers and sickles, and scare mongering over the prospect of a “return to tyranny” will pump substance back into the deflated political capital of the Yellowtard-led Opposition. The only way the Opposition could save themselves and put up a worthy challenge to the incumbent is to stop acting like Yellowtards. The first step is easy. Ditch “vice president” Leni Robredo as their leader and find someone who could actually lead. The hard part is, of course, coming up with an intelligent platform to match that leadership. For that you also need an intelligent leader. The solutions are obvious. The Opposition only need to get real.",Politics
Filipinos don’t need a helper. They need a LEADER,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/filipinos-dont-need-a-helper-they-need-a-leader/,"Here’s the whole trouble with the way the Philippine Opposition make their value proposition to the Filipino people: they insult them by constantly making them feel like victims. It seems they remain in a state of denial over the stellar approval ratings Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte continues to get year in and year out, survey after survey.
Since Duterte became a force to reckon with, the Opposition led by the bleeding-heart Yellowtards (the partisan bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) clung to their tired old mantra of “helping” the “less fortunate”. That spiel obviously no longer works. Thing is, it is obvious to everyone but the Yellowtards. They seem to have learnt nothing in the aftermath of their catastrophic loss in the 2019 national elections where not one in their coalition of eight prayerful senator hopefuls won a seat. These ill-fated erstwhile “senatoriables” carried on ad nauseum waxing poetic about “social justice”, “human rights”, and “equality” all of which were hopelessly abstract to the Filipino voter. On that nebulousness of their campaign “platform” alone, the Yellowtards evidently sought to insult the intelligence of Filipino voters with drivel utterly irrelevant to their day-to-day lives. That too was obvious. Not to the Yellowtards, however.
Filipinos don’t need help. They need to be led. They need to be led down a direction. This is the other thing that is obviously missing in the recipe of failure the Yellowtards keep cooking up — direction. What is it exactly that the Yellowtards propose Filipinos look to? Ask that question and all you will hear from them is an insulting answer: “freedom from tyranny”. There is no “tyranny” from which Filipinos need to be “freed”. The Yellowtards are, in essence, swindling Filipinos of their votes and precious attention spans with these imaginary promises.
Filipinos have had enough of having their votes scammed by this old Yellowtard sales pitch. Elections are just around the corner. Could it be possible that we will be hearing these same slogans from the Yellowtards once again? I’d bet good money that this is exactly what Filipinos will be getting. The same old Martial Law Crybabyism. The same old ghost stories about dead “martyrs” and war-on-drugs “victims”. The same old “US-(insert current Philippine President here) Dictatorship”. The same old Yellowtard bullshit.
In the last couple of decades or so, Filipinos have gained a lot of self-respect. They no longer want to be dependent. They no longer see themselves as the perpetual charity cases they once were. They are a people looking to step up to that next level befitting that of a modern secular democracy — a people that could hold their own and confidently do things their way.
They don’t want to be helped. They want to be led. They are looking for a leader, not a servant and, certainly not a wet nurse. Can the Opposition present to the Filipino people a person they could regard as a leader? That remains to be seen. For now, all they could come up with is “vice president” Leni Robredo. And that is why they continue to be the national laughingstock. Robredo is unable to see the healthy self-respect Filipinos now come equipped with to face the future.

Particularly revealing is the whole circus surrounding “red-tagging” where we’ve been audience to the baffling antics of a community of “activist” organisations that had time and again proudly flown red flags in practically all of their protest rallies now raising a shrill stink about “red-tagging”. What’s up with that, right?
Perhaps these “activists” once had noble intentions championing the “plights” of the oppressed and needy and calling out injustice perpetrated by the “powerful” and “more fortunate”. And all that jazz. To their credit, those causes remain worthy things to fight for. Much of the dysfunction that allow these inequalities and injustices to persist are so entrenched in Philippine society that these require competent activists to maintain awareness in a public that, in a democracy, has the power to influence politics.
Unfortunately, the Philippines’ communists and the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) had been successful at only one thing — propagating the wrong perception that they hold a monopoly on “activism”. In a recent tweet, communist “thought leader” Teddy Casino asserted that “Without organizations, activists are just rabble rousing individuals.” Evidently, Casino holds communist organisations in such high regard as to actually believe that real activists cannot exist outside of his dishonest community of terrorist-coddling organisations.
In truth, whether it is the mighty communist “women’s issues” organisation GABRIELA or a less media-connected Facebook group of women exchanging tips on parenthood and juggling work and motherhood, there are, believe it or not, cause-oriented communities outside of Joma Sison’s radar that have pertinent voices that need to be heard. And then there are organisations like GABRIELA that are backed by the chi chi likes of Liza Soberano and her mega-rich corporate employer ABS-CBN. Who do Filipinos choose to believe? People are led to believe by bozos like Teddy Casino that flying a red flag makes one’s “activism” valid. This, coming from the very same camps and their “thought leaders” who, when challenged or confronted about their real agendas, cry bloody “red-tagging” — a position that is dishonest to the point of being criminal in nature.
Filipinos need to rid their politics of these vermin. What are noble causes and important advocacies are corrupted by dishonest “thought leaders” who use these issues of national consequence to disguise an insidious mission to destroy democracy through violent “revolution”. Perhaps they may seem not as threatening as they once were — their “fighters” are more snowflake than guerrilla in appearance and their weapons more Apple than AK-47. If for anything, Filipinos should at least get rid of them because they insult Philippine democracy by suggesting that, despite the hard work of people who work within the legal frame, it is hopelessly broken. Philippine democracy is anything but broken. This is a fact that can be further re-enforced once Filipinos put their collective feet down and take back real activism from the communists and their “woke” Yellowtard allies.",Politics
Manifesto of the Yellowtard Wet Dream,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/manifesto-of-the-yellowtard-wet-dream/,"It’s a bit sad to see Philippine Opposition “activists” and partisans looking longingly overseas as their counterparts in other countries mount impressive mass protests on their city streets. You could almost imagine Filipino “activists” wailing about how they “invented” street “revolutions” back in the 1980s and now have to suffer the indignity of being reduced to a mere bleachers crowd.
There’s something to be said about how the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) all but squandered the abundant political capital they once enjoyed. Over a period stretching from 1983 when former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr was assassinated and crowned political saint through to the early- to mid-2000s, yellowtardism and its mob of “street parliamentarians” lorded over Philipine politics. Those heady days must have created the false sense of a bottomless well of silver or, shall we say, yellow bullets to “vanquish” any leader arbitrarilty slapped with the label “tyrant” or “fascist” by the one “thought leader” or another.
Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, this well of political capital ran dry long before they even realised it. It is no different to how the Philippines’ lush forests were denuded by the shortsightedness of a people who built an entire strategy on spending principal instead of living off interest. No different too to the baffling way Filipinos woke up one day surprised by a population that had suddenly ballooned to more than a hundred million. They just did not feel the rug being slowly pulled out from under their feet until it was too late.
Most astounding of all, the Yellowtards and their communist comrades still don’t get it. Inciting the same old “people power” circuses continues to be a cornerstone of their political strategy. So addicted are they to this dishonest approach that they now even use a dead baby — Baby River — as the main protagonist of their latest Victim Porn production. How low can they get? Evidently this is the lowest so far having tried a dead former senator, his dead wife, and a dead Interior Secretary to prop up one quaint “movement” after another or one two-bit politician or the other.
Small wonder that this motley group of commies, wokes, and prayerful “liberals” now forlornly look beyond Philippine borders with envy as protestors fill the streets from Bangkok to Hong Kong and from Seoul to the other side of the planet in Philly among other places. “Sana all”, they lament in their cultivated private Catholic school accents in between booger-crystallising sighs.",Politics
Dishonest Philippine Opposition are desperately politicising typhoon #RollyPH!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/dishonest-philippine-opposition-are-desperately-politicising-typhoon-rollyph/,"Just when you thought the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) could not plumb even lower depths in their desperate quest for power, here they are now seizing every opportunity to turn the imminent visit of super-typhoon Goni (code-named “Rolly” in the Philippines) into political gain. As of this writing, Rolly is expected to tear through Metro Manila, the Philippines’ premiere and most populous metropolis after first hitting the country’s East coast Sunday morning.
“Violent winds and intense rainfall” are expected that could trigger floods and landslides in an area of more than 20 million people, the weather service said.
There was a “high risk” of storm surges of more than three metres (10 feet) high along parts of the coast, it added.
At a time when Filipinos need to work together and look out for one another, Yellowtard “thought leaders” are priming the Filipino public to expect atrocious government response to the crisis. This, of course, is a classic political tactic meant to set themselves up for a blame barrage against the government they will likely launch once Rolly does the job they hope it will do.
In this respect, the Opposition play into an easy space. Poverty has rendered millions of Filipinos helplessly vulnerable to nature’s vicissitudes. Many of the tens of thousands of the victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) and Typhoon Washi (Sendong) which struck the Philippine cities of Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro in 2013 and 2011 respectively were impoverished city residents that had settled (many of them illegally) along coastal plains prone to storm surges. Back in 2006, a landslide struck and buried Barangay Guinsaugon in the municipality of St. Bernard in Leyte killing close to 2,000 people. This disaster followed a record 571.2mm of rainfall over five days — three months worth of average rainfall for that region. Fifteen years before that in the city of Ormoc in the same province, 5,000 souls perished in flashflooding and landslides also following heavy rainfall in 1991.
None of these facts seem to bother the Yellowtards. They even insert the plight of their pet mega-rich media conglomerate ABS-CBN into the narrative insisting that the cancellation of its franchise to broadcast this year is certain to spell disaster for the Philippines.
It is also interesting to observe the same partisans sitting around complaining about a lack of any word from the president. This considering that any word issued by the president will, in any case, be met by derision coming from these very same people.
It is plainly evident that members of the Philippine Opposition, most specially that Yellowtard clique that presumes to lead it, are not really looking out for the public good. They are only out to seize any opportunity to paint the Philippine government under a bad light and capitalise on any angle to bolster their quest for power.",Politics
Opposition disappointed as #RollyPH (Typhoon Goni) leaves the Philippines relatively unscathed,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/opposition-disappointed-as-rollyph-typhoon-goni-leaves-the-philippines-relatively-unscathed/,"Once again the Philippine Opposition’s prayers were left unanswered as Typhoon Goni (codenamed “Rolly” in the Philippines) passes relatively harmlessly. Like most typhoons plowing through the Philippines, Rolly left a trail of destruction of the sort regarded as normal by most Filipinos. But it was nothing like the catastrophe Opposition partisans were hoping for, and certainly a pale shadow of Category 5 super-typhoon Haiyan (codenamed “Yolanda” in the Philippines) that tore through Tacloban City in 2013 killing tens of thousands under the watch of then President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III.
In the lead up to Goni’s landfall in Catanduanes, members of the Opposition were already drumming up doomsday scenarios to prime the Filipino public to blame Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for what they hoped would be a botched disaster response effort. Unfortunately for them and to the consternation of the Yellowtards (the rabid clique within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan), Rolly delivered a disappointing performance. It weakened as it travelled through the rough terrain from the Philippines’ east coast west towards the southern outskirts of Metro Manila.
Despite pathetic efforts to drum up a rather lame #NasaanAngPangulo (“Where is the President?) hashtag vilification campaign on social media, not many political turnips were to be harvested from this natural calamity today for the Yellowtards. Indeed, Duterte’s political capital survived the passing of the planet’s strongest typhoon and he didn’t even need to show up for the cameras! To be fair, the Yellowtards after all look up to a role model — “vice president” Leni Robredo — who makes it her top priority to perform before the cameras when there is a lot of work to do quietly, specially in times of crisis.
Baffling, indeed, were the Yellowtards’ shrill calls for Duterte to show himself on national television considering they, on another vein, express disgust at the sight of their president at every opportunity. Goes to show that the Opposition don’t really know what they want of their government. Then again it actually is quite simple, really. All the Yellowtards really want is to ascend power again. Fortunately for them, the chance to do so legally is just around the corner as 2022 looms in the political horizon. All they need to do now is fashion themselves into the popular choice.
Spare a thought too for the wailing ABS-CBN Crybabies. They can’t seem to get over the reality that ABS-CBN fantards and talent alike are watching helplessly as their lunch is eaten in these times of calamity when “news reporting” delivers truck loads of advertising pesos to most “news media” companies. This merely highlights the fact that Carlo Katigbak should resign as President and CEO of ABS-CBN. Katigbak had one job as chief executive of embattled media conglomerate ABS-CBN. He was paid the big bucks not only to secure the investment of the company’s shareholders but to ensure an acceptable return on their investment is squeezed out of the enterprise every year. Well, so much for that, right?
What next for the Yellowtards and the broader Opposition they presume to “lead”? Necropolitics (parading stiffs as “heroes”) no longer works. This latest failed circus sent a clear message to them that disaster-porn no longer yields political mileage either. So guess what: the Yellowtards need to go back to the basics: winning elections the old-fashioned way. This means putting up a platform ordinary Filipinos can relate with and finding a charismatic leader to pitch this and their political brand to the voters. If the Yellowtards see their halfwit “vice president” Leni Robredo as the person who will do that job for them, well, they will likely be in for their next big disappointment. Filipinos deserve better than an Opposition that insults rather than engages their intelligence. They will highlight that fact in the next national elections in 2022.",Politics
Typhoon Goni (Ph codename #RollyPH) an epic PR fail for the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/typhoon-goni-ph-codename-rollyph-an-epic-pr-fail-for-the-philippine-opposition/,"It seems the Opposition led by the bloc rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) are scrounging around for opportunities to pick up the pieces of the shattered dreams left by super-typhoon Goni (codenamed “Rolly” in the Philippines). In the lead up to what they hoped would turn into a catastrophe for the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, the Opposition had mounted an intense campaign to pre-wire the Philippine public into thinking that what was coming would be a scourge that would put blood on the hands of Duterte. Instead, what they got was an abject PR fail — one that leaves them with nothing but their hypocritical calls to “donate” to the relief effort. Of course, these calls come with some strings with these same partisans suggesting that the only worthwhile charity channel to donate to is none other than the office of their “vice president” and party leader Leni Robredo. Convenient, right?
The Yellowtards are indeed distinguished in their achieving something that no other Opposition camp had achieved before — turning a typhoon into an Epic PR Fail.
If the the chi chi members of the Opposition would only pause to reflect, they will easily note some distrubing aspects in the way they conduct themselves that would explain why their best efforts to appear virtuous before the public turn them into sad laughingstocks. At the core of their dysfunctional political messaging is their self-righteousness. They make like they hold a monopoly on being the “good” while all the rest who oppose them are the “evil” ones. This monomanic binary nature in the way they regard things is likely a product of the chi chi private Catholic school upbringing that their foremost “thought leaders” grew up on. It is a small mindedness that is amplified further as a result of their penchant for cocooning themselves in social media echo chambers blocking anyone who challenges their Holy views and carrying on amongst themselves exchanging mutual high-fives.
The short saga of how the Yellowtards’ Reverse-Midas-Touch syndrome turned Typhoon Rolly against their dishonest agenda is a classic Boy-Who-Cried-Wolf story. Too much criticising of any sitting incumbent while offering no pertinent solutions or alternatives merely makes one a pathetic whiner. They should have waited for facts to surface from the ground first before they passed judgement on a government disaster response effort they had not yet seen in action. Unfortunately for the Opposition, even if all the bad news and piles of dead bodies they were hoping for start to emerge from the rubble left by Typhoon Rolly, all of this effort to set themselves up on a pulpit to deliver their heroic I-Told-You-Sos will already have been wasted.
Filipinos will simply pick up and move on like they always do after every typhoon and see all the hype about why ABS-CBN “should have been there to help” and all the other dishonest messages the Yellowtards shove down their throats as mere noise coming from an irrelevant Opposition. Filipinos deserve better than an Opposition mob of people who salivate over the political capital they could amass every time a potential disaster looms in the horizon. Filipinos don’t the kind of Opposition the Yellowtards and their communist comrades have become (or have always been). Filipinos deserve better.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s dishonesty and grandstanding during disasters is turning Filipino voters off,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/leni-robredos-dishonesty-and-grandstanding-during-disasters-is-turning-filipino-voters-off/,"Current Vice President Leni Robredo is a dishonest person. That needs to be emphasized as a community service. The public needs to know that she has been the bane of Philippine society since she started her stint as the second in the presidential line of succession or a spare tire if we are to be blunt about it. She quite often acts as if she is the President though. She does not care about protocols. She forgets her place in the world order.
Robredo quite often takes a swipe at President Rodrigo Duterte like it is part of her job. She tries very hard to paint the President as uncaring while painting herself as the country’s saviour. The fact is, she is only doing further damage to an already fragmented society by constantly contradicting Duterte’s policies and directives.  We all know she has an axe to grind against Duterte for sacking her twice from his cabinet.  She was sacked for being incompetent and for always talking to the media about her “ideas” before discussing things with other fellow cabinet members. In short, she is not a team player. We knew this would happen since she is a member of the Opposition.
The recent typhoon that devastated parts of the country, particularly Cagayan and Isabela, exposed once again not just the country’s vulnerability to disasters but also Robredo’s penchant for grandstanding. In a show of clockwork-like predictability, she was pictured walking in flooded waters making all kinds of efforts to “help” the victims of the typhoon. One can be forgiven for saying she was trying to overshadow the first responders of the rescue operation. If she really cared, she would get out of the way and let the experts get on with their jobs with urgency. But she wouldn’t let an opportunity for an early campaign for the next election to slip by especially with the media following her every move.
Unfortunately, Robredo and her rabid supporters including her own daughters Tricia and Aika were trying their best to undermine the state’s rescue efforts by claiming the government abandoned the people who were in distress. That’s exceedingly unfair to the hard-working men and women of the government emergency response teams in the military, coast guard, and local governments who risked their lives to help those in need.
The Opposition made sure the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo “trended” again and again to make it look like Duterte was “missing in action” at the height of the recent typhoons. Robredo’s daughters Tricia and Aika were leading the pack of wolves attacking Duterte on social media. They were implying he was still sleeping while the country was getting battered by typhoon Ulysses. It’s worth noting that Robredo’s daughters are are not very smart. They don’t realise that because they are closely related to the Vice President, anything they say for or against Duterte has implications and reflects on the Office of the Vice President. It came as no surprise when Duterte finally responded to them.
Duterte called out Robredo for her opportunistic moves and swore to expose her as a liar for “pretending to make calls” and giving the impression she was coordinating rescue efforts. The President had to remind her that coordination with the different government agencies was done prior to the typhoon arriving and what she was doing was merely reacting to the situation. Of course Robredo wouldn’t have a clue about the government’s efforts because she is not in the loop. She’s not included in the meetings.
It was only right for Duterte to do that. Robredo never bothered to correct her rabid supporters including her own daughters who were asking where the President was during the typhoon when their mother knew where Duterte was – at an ASEAN summit. Robredo just allowed the hashtag to go on. She was probably so flattered by their praises to realise she was coming across as a narcissist blaming the President for the disaster and she taking all the credit for the government agencies’ rescue efforts.
In her defense, Robredo claimed she didn’t ask where the President was during the typhoon. But her statements to the media imply that there was absence of leadership during a crisis. She called Duterte “pikon” and said she stepped in because the government didn’t seem to be answering flood victims’ tweets. That wasn’t a very smart thing to say. If there is a national emergency, one shouldn’t rely on social media for answers. As the country’s Vice President, she should know what hotline to use for emergencies.
Robredo’s main problem is her vanity. She loves the media attention. The media is causing her downfall though. They are feeding her narcissism.  Some members of mainstream media are propping up Robredo and fashioning her into some sort of Florence Nightingale figure.  Her every move is documented as if what she’s doing is so different from what a lot of Vice Presidents did in the past. Previous VP’s like Jejomar Binay were even criticised for being trapo (traditional politician) for doing the same thing she’s doing now.
The media keeps praising Robredo as if she’s the only government official working. But she’s not the one doing the dirty work and actually rescuing people. What she’s doing is already being done by the local government and members of the military and Coast Guard. Yes, more help is needed but they are making her into a saint as a matter of misplaced priority.
All this is in preparation of the next Presidential election in 2022. This early, Robredo is already campaigning because her supporters are pushing her. It’s sometimes baffling why out of all Liberal Party members they only have Leni as the top bet for the 2022 Presidential Election. It’s likely because, one, no one else wants to put their hand up because it is a fact it is a losing party and, two, Leni is the only one dumb enough not to realise that.
If Robredo were honest with herself, she would say “I’m sorry but I cannot handle the job of the Presidency”. The problem is she is not honest with herself and her supporters. She thinks being President is all about giving dole outs to the public and making Filipinos look like sad charity cases while she plays Santa Claus. If she continues to undermine the efforts of government agencies including the military, she will fall out of their favour and lose respect. Some military men have already expressed their disdain for her.
No wonder a lot of people call Robredo the President of Twitter. Her followers and supporters are good at making hashtags “trend” on social media but fail miserably in getting the voters’ support during elections where it really counts. It’s obviously because hashtags can trend using fewer people while winning an election needs real people. They don’t even have originality. The hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo was first used on Noynoy when instead of attending the wake of the slain SAF, he went to an inauguration at a Japanese factory. The context was different then. Now they are using it to demand Duterte go out during a strong typhoon.
These people are never going to win an election because the public can see through their lies and negative propaganda. Honestly, they are simply not going to win with Robredo as their leader.",Politics
Joe Biden wins US #Election2020 on an “I am not Donald Trump” platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/joe-biden-wins-us-election2020-on-an-i-am-not-donald-trump-platform/,"This is what happens when a nation votes against someone rather than for someone. In the case of the United States following this year’s election, the president will be a lame duck with a Senate dominated by Republicans. That’s a statement of relativity although there already is some evidence that Joe Biden may turn out to be a lame president in absolute terms — basically a mere compromise to another four years of Donald Trump and one propped up by his association with the former popular president Barack Obama. Indeed, even his candidacy attracted only tentative support from his own Democrat camp.
If Biden is president because of all that, his term will be an interesting one as he will have to earn the trust of almost half of the American electorate who voted for Trump and a sizeable chunk of the electorate who voted for him only because he was the lesser evil. That’s at least 70 percent of the American electorate plus a hostile Senate.
To begin with, it is hard to win over conservatives because their ideologies are built around deeply-ingrained aspects of human nature — fear and hate of and for the different, solidarity with people who are like us in belief and appearance, aggression when personal interests are threatened. Liberalism, as such, inherently counts on modern intellect to overcome those basic instincts. It is an uphill battle though because liberals are up against thousands of years of conservative human civilisation whereas many of today’s “woke” ideals enjoy only a century of ascendancy (at best).
The important thing therefore is to engage rather than demonise. Unfortunately for most liberal camps, their ideology of “inclusiveness” had turned hypocritical and judgmental, morphing into an extremist “woke” brand known for its notorious “cancel culture”. This is the lesson the Democrats and other liberal “movements” that are facing popular conservative opponents need to take heed of. It is one thing to demonise another’s belief systems but to do so and shut the door to any further challenge only drives the conversation underground. This underground conversation the liberals and their extremist “woke” cliques have lost sight of is what is likely behind the “surprising” electoral fight the Trump camp managed to put up in these elections. The fact is, Americans still have such conversations around what they really think and believe in amongst themselves over beers and burgers in their backyards — thinking and believing that is masked by a politically-correct face one needs to wear at the workplace and in front of “polite” company.
In the spirit of free speech in this “free market of ideas” we hold sacred, both camps are well within their rights to “demonise” the other as they see fit. However, liberal wokedom have to shake their unproductive demonise-then-block-and-cancel habit. That’s just being cowardly and dishonest. If you just have to demonise then do so, but leave the forum open for people to challenge your assertions point-by-point.
If wokedom think they have “won” this battle, they’re in for yet even more surprises and these are surprises that they themselves conceal from the little echo chambers they prefer to inhabit. The real world remains stark and cruel. Human nature is not the rosy thing idealists and hipster snowflakes would like it to be. The liberal agenda is still viable but to push it forward requires an intelligent regard for the reality of what it means to be human — that we all, at the cores of our beings, remain the same bunch of chimps who compete for dominance within our tribes, routinely signal fitness and superiority, ostracise and even banish deviants, and remain responsive to physical punishment and reward. The way forward for liberalism is to embrace our biological humanity and apply an honest intellect to suppressing the aspects of it we want to mitigate in order to achieve the idealised humanity we aspire to.
The woke community are on point styling Trump as a vestige of the reptilian complex that competes for a voice in our minds. In doing so, they inadvertently highlight the point they routinely miss. We need to acknowledge that this part of humanity still exists and cannot be simply willed away by “cancelling” it.",Politics
How the social climber @MrsUnlawyer tweeting about “educating” her “DDS” nanny turned into a raging debate,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/how-the-social-climber-mrsunlawyer-tweeting-about-educating-her-dds-nanny-turned-into-a-raging-debate/,"Should employers be influencing the political views of their employees? It brought the core of the controversy surrounding the limits to which an employer can influence her employees’ personal choices front and centre in what is evidently an unresolved debate. For that matter, the ethics around whether it is right for a person who enjoys a position of power over a party the personal views of whom she seeks to influence come to light. This also brings to mind the “normalised” practice of religious leaders wielding their followers like a political weapon come election time. Or the Roman Catholic Church’s dishonest use of “pastoral letters” to indoctrinate their congregation on their preferred political position. It raises questions around the legitimacy of a religious “vote bloc” when considering how said vote is an outcome of inappropriate influence applied by a leader or superior.
This all depends, perhaps, on the the contract that underlies the context where said “education” is being applied. In the case of an employer-employee relationship, said contract governing that relationship will likely exclude guidance or directives to an employee coming from a superior not related to the services stipulated in an employment contract. As such, an employee’s political views clearly lie outside of the remit of an employer to prescribe. In the case of teacher-student relationships, one can argue that parents give license to teachers to impart their values on their charges. However, even in such cases, there is still a line that prompts debate — is it right for a teacher to encourage students to attend the protest rallies of a particular camp? Some years back, the sight of students in uniform attending — even instigating and leading — protest rallies was a thing leading some quarters to question whether the parents of these kids (often pictured on public channels) were aware of their schools’ complicity in these activities.
The debate continues, much of it packaged under the euphemism “voter education”. Examine the notion more closely and it is easy to see that a thin line separates that concept from the more insidious field of voter re-education. Voter “education” — more precisly re-education — becomes potent as a tool for furthering political agendas when applied within the context of a the also-debatable premise that voters are too dumb to be given the responsibility of choosing their leaders. This brings us to the curious case of a certain “Mrs Unlawyer” whose Twitter thread on her own efforts to “educate” the nanny of her kids (she descibes her as a “diehard Duterte supporter” or “DDS”) sparked an intense ethical debate.
The kernel of Mrs Unlawyer’s “education” was the idea that her nanny had much more to lose making the “wrong” decision on who to vote for in the coming elections; that while she felt no “adverse effects on [her] family” as an outcome of the “lousy government” of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, it is her (the nanny) who should be reflecting more carefully on whether this government actually delivered promised changes to her relatively wretched lot. Mrs Unlawyer goes on to tweet how, as the conversation with her nanny progressed, “it finally sank in how voting for someone inept impacted people in her social class so much more adversely”.
To be fair to Mrs Unlawyer, she points out towards the end of her thread that she cautioned her nanny not to “let me dictate to you”. But that is basically like telling someone “it’s up to you what you want to do next” after softening the subject to a pulp with a barrage of emotional blackmail.
Few people would disagree that bosses exert disproportionate influence over their subordinates — more so when they wield direct control over their financial situations (some people leaders don’t). The question is, is it right to use one’s position of power to exert influence over their subordinates — people who are effectively a captured audience?
Perhaps conversations of the sort Mrs Unlawyer shared over Twitter go on everyday in normal course of most people’s daily interactions in obscurity. Mrs Unlawyer’s only mistakes were to (1) subject her personal circumstances to public scrutiny given that she had made categorically judgmental statements about one political camp and (2) introduce into the mix the equally-controversial issue of the widespread employment of domestic servants whose services are made “affordable” by an economic structure regarded as “oppressive” by the very same political clique that Mrs Unlawyer sees herself as a member of. That opens her and others like her up to charges of hypocrisy. If you benefit from a social order that makes certain services “affordable”, criticising said social order makes you a hypocrite, basically.
Meanwhile, the debate as to whether Mrs Unlawyer was “educating” or really just re-educating her nanny rages on.",Politics
Tricia and Aika Robredo are a couple of spoilt brats,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/tricia-and-aika-robredo-are-a-couple-of-spoilt-brats/,"Have Tricia and Aika, daughters of “vice president” Leni Robredo, owned up to the now-infamous tweet conversation that started a fire? It seems not, seeing that no less than the Inquirer Editor himself insults his readers’ intelligence by playing dumb and insisting that said tweets “make no mention of the President, that particular hashtag [#NasaanAngPangulo], or any word of criticism” against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
To refresh our memories, here are the offending tweets again. Make your own inferences on who the two girls were referring to considering the time these tweets were fielded.
The sisters exhibited grace neither then when, at the time Typhoon Ulysses was wreaking havoc and first responders scrambled to deliver their vital services to a nation that needed to work together in those critical days, nor today in the midst of the fallout following their shameful behaviour when they ought to be taking personal accountability for their actions. Instead, rather than face the music, they now hide behind the skirt of their mother,  the Inquirer, and their dishonest supporters and play dumb.
Worse, they are now being put up as “victims” of “bullying” allegedly by Netizens labelled “trolls” by Opposition “thought leaders”. Robredo herself went on record to decry the “bullying of her daughters over tweets seemingly directed at President Rodrigo Duterte”. What flies over the heads of Robredo and her fandom is in her insisting that “We have trained them to stand up for themselves and what they believe in”. Funny that. As of this writing, neither daughters Aika nor Tricia have issued any statements themselves on the matter to categorically clarify who or what those tweets were really referring to. Perhaps it is too much to ask two “adult” spoilt brats to set the record straight themselves and not have to rely on the Inquirer Editor or their mother to do that for them.
The fact is, the Robredo sisters are public figures and ones directly associated with the Office of the Vice President (assuming for a moment that Leni Robredo is the duly-elected one). They have actively associate themselves with the OVP, assert support for the “vice president”, and amplify her PR stunts on their respective social media accounts. Aika and Tricia cannot simply shoot and run. They are holding a smoking gun and need to own up to the shots they fire.
The President of the Philippines is the highest office of the land. Robredo insists she is the “vice president” and owes deference to the office at least in public. If she also insists that her daughters can hold their own as individuals and as adults, Robredo should demonstrate consistency to that position by not using her office to defend them as she does today. Let Aika and Tricia Robredo man up and tell the Filipino public exactly what they meant by those tweets.
Otherwise, they should be the good vice presidential daughters they fancy themselves as and behave as children of any self-respecting public official should. You can’t have your cake and eat it. If Aika and Tricia want to speak their minds as individuals, they should do so not as Leni Robredo’s daughters but as Aika and Tricia — two grown women who can be expected to explain themselves to their followers when called to do so.",Politics
Philippine Opposition “thought leaders” look to Joe Biden’s victory with envy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/philippine-opposition-thought-leaders-look-to-joe-bidens-victory-with-envy/,"Philippine Opposition partisans and “activists” are salivating over the victory of Democratic candidate Joe Biden over Donald Trump. Seeing no less than a former colonial master “triumph” over “tyranny” is an inspiration for these folks as they scrounge around for “parallels” with their own plight. With the 2022 national elections in the Philippines just around the corner, they now reflect on the challenges they face going up against the anointed candidate of a formidable incumbent, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
At the moment, all the Philippine Opposition has to go for is an anti-Duterte platform and not much else. Nonetheless that doesn’t seem to stop them from drawing inspiration from Biden who also ran on an “I am NOT Donald Trump” platform. Both the US and Philippine Opposition camps also enjoyed the support of their countries’ respective mainstream media outlets and entertainment celebrities.
Unfortunately for the Yellowtards (the leading partisan bloc within the Opposition who are loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan), the similarities end there. Biden ran under the banner of a robust and mature party with a relatively coherent liberal ideology. In contrast, whoever will be leading the Philippines’ Opposition against Duterte’s endorsed candidate in the campaign for the 2022 election will be faced with the daunting task of hewing a motley collection of religious cult leaders, showbiz starlets, and power-hungry oligarchs and warlords into a pointed force that could be thrust into the heart of the Duterte edifice. Good luck with that.
Firstly, the various Opposition camps are united only by a hatred for Duterte and not much else. This means nothing will stop any one of these camps from fielding their own presidential bet for 2022 effectively spreading wide and thin any hope of any one of them posing even the slightest challenge to Duterte’s formidable following.
Second, most Opposition camps remain enamored by current “vice president” Leni Robredo whose claim to the role of “Opposition leader” seems to remain unchallenged for now. However, even in the unlikely scenario where all Opposition camps were to back Robredo as a single candidate against Duterte’s endorsed successor, it is unlikely that she could muster a strong enough following on her own to pose a threat specially considering her persistently strong association with the Yellowtards and their diminished political brand.
Third, the Opposition offers no vision or strategic alternative to the Duterte way. It is only the communists who offer a mature and consistent ideology which, many observers dismiss as more a liability than an asset to the broader Opposition community. The all-too-familiar ouster rhetoric which the Yellowtards share with the communists only raises a question both seem reluctant to answer: And then what?
Two familiar words describe the quaint fascination with this year’s elections in the US exhibited by members of the Philippine Opposition: colonial mentality. It is all a waste though seeing that the lessons underlying these events that abound seem to fly over the pointed heads of their “thought leaders”. There really is nothing about whatever turn politics in the US take that changes the fortunes of the Yellowtards. There is still that inconvenient detail of winning elections that they hadn’t gotten around to figuring out. Until they get around to thinking seriously about that capability gap, there really is nothing more they can offer to the Filipino beyond being the sad waste of space that they are. Filipinos deserve better.",Politics
Leni Robredo is not good for the intellectual growth of the Filipino people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/leni-robredo-is-not-good-for-the-intellectual-growth-of-the-filipino-people/,"It is quite amazing that the Opposition have not realised yet that all “vice president” Leni Robredo offers is the here-and-now and nothing much beyond that. Indeed, at the time of this writing, Robredo is top of mind amongst her fandom having just scored PR points that landed her some media — and social media — mileage owing to her much-photographed “contribution” to the response and relief effort as two major typhoons within weeks of one another ravaged the Philippines.
In propagating the same old traditional messaging that aims more towards self-promotion and less to other more honourable intents, Robredo sustains a sticky habit that keeps the political chatter stuck on personalities rather than on ideas. As can be observed by the outcome of The Leni Robredo Show written and produced by the eminent “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards (the rabid bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan that presumes to “lead” the Opposition) in response to the impact of recent typhoons Rolly and Ulysses, practically the entire conversation revolved around who did what or, worse, who did more than the other. The more important part of the conversation — how much in the overall scheme of things was a achieved — took a back seat to all the pettiness.
Here, the “overall scheme of things” refers to the broader issue of disaster management — Preparation, Response, and Relief. The latter two, Response and Relief, are often the ones that make the news and, woefully, in the wrong way. The recent episodes starring the “vice president” in the title role illustrate this. Response and Relief are often the most “newsworthy” aspects of disaster management because they have a set of characters not present in the Preparation story — victims. When victims are part of the cast of characters, Filipinos’ favourite protagonist in any story — the Hero — majestically swoops in to save not just the day and but, more importantly, media ratings.
While there is a story to be told about Preparation, it is all just too boring for the average attention-deficited televiewer. Tall and dashing fire fighters and the damsels in negligees they carry out of towering infernos are always better at hooking in an audience compared to stories about the geeky fire wardens who walk around the office with clipboards inspecting fire extingquishers and emergency exits. In the case of the dramas spun by PR managers and “news” producers around annual typhoons disasters in the Philippines, the rotten unfairness of it all is the same. When disaster strikes, the “heroes” get disproportionate kudos for the handful of lives saved. But the people who’s job it is to quietly prepare for or, more importantly, prevent disaster routinely go unsung. Yet it is the work of these unsung heroes that save millions of lives. Unfair indeed.
Leni Robredo is one of those dishonest people who habitually steps onto the “hero” pedestal to exploit disaster and claim credit at the expense of the quiet achievers whose collective work prevented loss of or impact to life that could have dwarfed the handful “saved” by such crooked “heroes”.
Rather than regard the bigger system we are called to design to implement truly systemic and sustainable solutions to mitigate routine risks posed to the Philippines by the typhoons that had long been facts of Filipino life, people like Leni Robredo dumb down essential conversations that need to be had. It’s time Filipinos stop putting up with the intellectual bankruptcy that politicians like Robredo foment. It’s time Filipinos embrace real change and reform their dysfunctional political culture.",Politics
Satire piece on Opposition senatoriables for 2022 enrage Frank Baraan and Kakie Pangilinan,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/satire-piece-on-opposition-senatoriables-for-2022-enrage-frank-baraan-and-kakie-pangilinan/,"It was supposed to be just a satirical post — popular blog Adobo Chronicles being, after all, a satire channel. In its piece “Siete palabras: LIBERAL PARTY ANNOUNCES 2022 SENATORIAL LINE-UP” published Saturday, the Chronicles “announced” a “Magic Seven” slate consisting of top Opposition social media “thought leaders”…
The magic seven are ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin, VP daughter Aika Robredo, convict and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa, actress Vilma Santos, blogger Francis Baraan IV, blogger Jover Laurio and Sharon Cuneta’s daughter Kakie Pangilinan.
The Adobo Chronicles prides itself in being “your best source of up-to-date unbelievable news” — a claim that is displayed at its site masthead. Just the same, the fact of it being a satire site still managed to escape the faculties of a number of the illustrious folk of the “Magic Seven”. One of them was the chi chi Frank Baraan, son of notorious former Justice Undersecretary Francis Baraan III, who was quick off the mark to issue his reaction.
In a subsequent tweet, Baraan wonders out loud; “I don’t know how this rumor started, or if this was meant to be sarcastic or funny. But the way the article was written, obviously, the writer is DDS & wants to paint LP candidates as losers,” evidently still none the wise about the satirical nature of the article.
Just as quick to fire off the hip is Her Royal Showbiz Highness Kakie Pangilinan, daughter of Senator and Mrs. Cuneta who, in a tweet, sought to make a clarification known to the madla…
Certainly not much of the sort of sugar and spice and everything nice that one would expect of a nineteen year old scion of Pinoy showbiz and Yellowtard royalty, right?
On a more serious note, one then wonders. The 2022 national elections are just around the corner, which means 2021 will be a campaign year. This episode highlights a grim reality for the Philippine Opposition — the fact that they still have no idea as to what their campaign platform will be and who their presidential and senatorial bets will be. They are up against a popular incumbent and with just months coming into a crucial campaign year, the nearest semblance of a senatorial slate is an Adobo Chronicles satire piece.
The Opposition would be doing itself big favours getting their shit together this early. Current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a very popular political opponent and will likely bring this popularity to bear anointing his chosen successor. With its cornerstone partisan brands — the Yellowtard flag of the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan and the hammer and sickle of the Communist Party of the Philippines — in tatters, the Opposition are hard-pressed to come up with a new narrative that could resonate with Filipinos strongly enough to pose a challenge to the administration camp. So far, it still remains to be seen if its “leaders”, if any, are up to the job at hand.",Politics
All bark and no bite: Will Leni Robredo REALLY stand up to Duterte as his EQUAL?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/all-bark-and-no-bite-will-leni-robredo-really-stand-up-against-duterte-as-his-equal/,"That remains to be seen. Then again, on second thought, hasn’t Leni Robredo always been on a campaign against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte?
From Day One, “vice president” Leni Robredo remained on campaign mode against her own government long after the elections had been concluded and well into her (disputed) term as VP. She was supposedly elected to be vice president to Duterte. Instead, she continues to feed off an umbilical cord into which the Yellowtards (the bloc within the the Opposition rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) continue to pump a cocktail of destructive and often seditious messaging into her pointed head.
One wonders then where Robredo finds the gall to claim she is being dishonoured by the president and then claim that she now finds the resolve to “fight back”…
“Kapag binastos ako, lalaban ako. Kapag binastos mo ako lalaban ako kasi kailangan kong maging halimbawa, eh. Kailangan ko maging halimbawa sa ibang mga kababaihan na nababastos din,” Robredo said.
(Translated to proper English: “When I am treated rudely, I will fight back. When you are rude to me, I will fight because I need to be an example. I need to be an example to women who are also treated rudely.”)
Overlooking the triple-redundancy in her statement above, one could see that Robredo is invoking a familiar tactic to dishonestly elicit a shrill emotional reaction from her fandom: playing the Woman Card.
Why is it suddenly about women? Well, it is because women are habitually regarded as the “victims” in just about any “fight” partisans and “activists” of wokedom get into. Thus it is the easy pathway they habitually take to make a public appeal. Robredo, in doing so, does a disservice to womankind by propagating the notion that they are perenial “victims” in the ironic fights she tries to incite to fuel her dishonest campaign against her own government.
If women truly aspire to hold their own in the jungle that is national politics, they need to demonstrate that they are able to face their adversaries not as women but as true gender-neutral fighters. There are no women or men in politics — only people and parties competing for attention and, ultimately (this being a democracy), the votes needed to acquire political power.
Does Robredo want to be known to be a leader who acquired power because she is a woman? Or does she want to be known as a leader who acquired power because she is categorically better than the competition? Only when Leni Robredo and her clique of titas are able to answer “no” to the earlier and “yes” to the latter, can they claim to fight an honest fight in Philippine democratic politics. Until then, Robredo runs on a Victim Platform — the worst kind and the kind that keeps the Philippines’ political culture backward. This is the last thing Filipinos need. Filipinos need to make a conscious decision to stop being victims and modernise the thinking they apply to their young democracy. The sort of Woman Card the Yellowtards keep playing works against that aspiration. Enough is enough!",Politics
Should La Salle student Johnrey Apellido apologize for insulting “VP” Leni Robredo?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/should-la-salle-student-johnrey-apellido-apologize-for-insulting-vp-leni-robredo/,"Democracy is what Filipinos signed up for. Facebook (FB) and every other social media platform give every citizen the avenue to express themselves publicly with nationwide reach. The fact that several institutions and personalities are expressing alarm and rage over the comments recently issued by a La Salle (Bacolod) student against the country’s “VP” is a sign that Filipinos are showing less tolerance for free and unbridled expression.
Free Speech In Peril?
We all know Filipinos love the word “Free”. But could this be a movement towards curtailing the freedom of speech Filipinos value so highly? Will the country soon adopt laws that prohibit the free flow of ideas and opinions? Do we need to go to the extent of policing and criminalizing certain words and thoughts? What’s ironic though is that the Reds and Yellows (those “Never Again” Martial Law crybabies) apparently are the ones crying foul the most.
If these Filipinos want speech under control, then are they suggesting authoritarian/dictatorial rule is really what best suits them and is the type of government they deserve? There are gag orders that inhibit talking about certain topics, red-tagging is becoming a big “no no”, and there are screening committees in FB in the guise of “fact checkers”. If we believe Filipinos are spinning out of control in expressing themselves, then don’t let these kids play with the media gun called Facebook.
Johnrey Apellido has just insulted the second most powerful official in the land, who FYI also happens to possess the “woman card”. If he does not apologize or retract the statement, the University of St. La Salle, Bacolod which has been dragged into the controversial statement might choose to disown the student.
In the FB post, Mr. Apellido shows the middle finger with the statement:
Kantutin mo si Leni Tatay Digong para mataohan na yan kulang sa dilig kaya nagiging bobo.
For one thing, an apology, just like respect, shouldn’t be demanded; it should be given willingly, not out of compulsion. In our effort to inculcate GMRC (good manners and right conduct) in our youth, they must be taught to do so from the heart. Otherwise, we are just moving from one form of Martial Law to another.
If Filipinos cannot bear the freedom to insult public officials, then democracy is not for them. Or maybe Filipinos are not yet ready for democracy. Democracy is for societies that have evolved to be advanced enough to issue responsible/respectable statements, and like adults engage is civil conversations.
Lack of Respect
A more fundamental question is: why do Filipinos elect officials they can’t respect in the first place? Recall how people freely called the previous president “Abnoy”. In some more traditional/conservative countries, a simple expression of disrespect to the king or president will not go unpunished. Somehow it makes sense, since how can soldiers follow their commander if they can’t even respect him?
We may have to give this young collegian some slack for honestly expressing his feelings. He could just be that little child in the tale of “the Emperor’s new clothes”, who had the simple-mindedness to say what everyone else was too ashamed to express out loud. The root issue may not be the lack of good manners among the youth, but rather – why some leaders are deemed not worthy of respect.
Leni’s biggest problem these days is all the negative labelling that has stuck to her face which just won’t go away: “Fake VP“, “Lugaw Queen“, and now “Bobo“. Once you are labeled this lowly, it is almost a death sentence to one’s political career. Being the biggest and likely only bet of the Yellowtards this upcoming May 9, 2022 presidential elections, it seems to be “mission impossible” to get her act together in time to salvage whatever positive image she has left.
Nevertheless, being perceived as “bobo” was her own undoing. Leni (who captured the VP seat just because her husband Jesse died)  took her role as lead opposition so seriously she made it her crusade to put the Duterte administration (which she in fact a part of) in bad light not just to fellow Filipinos but moreover in the eyes of the international community. Talk about an administration allotting a budget to systematically shoot itself on the foot. From the get-go, she has been a loose cannon that just kept firing at the administration on every turn: how to more humanely handle the drug issue, how to efficiently handle disaster relief, how to more compassionately handle the pandemic… Quite frankly, the only ones who appreciated Leni’s nagging unsolicited advice to administration officials running the show were those still living in the sinking Yellow submarine.
The Satellite
There was a group of scientists and engineers building a communications satellite. It was so sophisticated it was taking them months to complete. Then came the VP of the aerospace company (who just inherited the position because his Ph.D. father died) who suddenly issued a memo to everyone: “I strongly believe that it would be better if the satellite was launched on a rocket and made to orbit the earth in space, rather than being made to sit inside the building.” Puzzled by the seemingly grade-schooler-level official pronouncement from the top, a newbie engineer asked the program’s chief architect about the memo; the latter just told the young promising worker: “lad don’t mind that ‘VP’ too much; she has no idea how complex our work here is. Just focus on finishing the thruster assembly in time for the scheduled tests before launch date”.",Politics
Philippine Opposition bent on POLITICISING the Jonel Nuezca shooting incident,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/philippine-opposition-bent-on-politicising-the-jonel-nuezca-shooting-incident/,"As expected, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the block within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists are seizing the opportunity to politicise the shooting incident that left Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio dead. The dishonest logic that underpins this politicisation campaign is all-too-familiar: (1) put up this isolated incident as sufficient sampling to make conclusions about the entire Philippine police force and (2) use this “indictment” to conclude that it is the fault of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that (2a) the Gregorio shooting happened and (2b) the Philippine police are “a bunch of killers”.
Deconstructed this way, it becomes quite evident how the Opposition are bent on propagating dishonest reasoning to further pre-determined political agendas. The pre-set agenda here, of course, is to make Duterte look bad (as a pretext to “oust” him illegally) and to make the police force look bad as a foundation for the victim porn that is the foundation of their crooked “activism”.
The reality is that there is no strong evidence that the perpetrator in this shooting, police officer Jonel Nuezca acted in a way that is necessarily representative of the character of the Philippine police. For one thing, the incident did not involve an actual police operation. Nuezca was not in uniform and no police procedures were evident in what transpired. The incident was seemingly an outcome of an altercation between two families possibly going back many months. Indeed, one of the people on the scene was also appealing to everyone that all keep calm until Barangay authorities arrive — indicating that Nuezca, despite being a police officer, was not regarded as the highest authority at the scene and was not working in collaboration with any police personnel.
In short, this is just another criminal case where the alleged perpetrator just happens to be a police officer.
Of course, understanding these simple bits of logic (or the specific circumstances of the incident where the logic of screeching Yellowtards and communists simply break down) will not easily assuage the shrill “activism” that the Opposition are engineering around it. Applying reason, after all, involves the use of a less inflammatory cognitive faculty than emotionalism. Unfortunately for everyone, however, the very “activism” of the Yellowtards and communists while pretending in intent to be cries for “justice”, will only degrade any opportunity to learn important lessons from this tragedy that will have contributed to sustainable rule of justice in the Philippines.
The fact is, the Gregorio shooting is a microcosm of Philippine society — a confluence of circumstances involving a bunch of morons coming together at the wrong time in the wrong place and everyone of these morons failing to know enough when to shut up.
If there really is a problem with the Philippine police, then, by all means, investigate that problem properly and act on the results of that investigation where appropriate. The shooting of Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio is a crime that also deserves to be investigated properly and, following that investigation, put through the criminal justice system. To politicise it subtracts from the justice the Gregorios deserve. It seems that the Yellowtards and communists would rather see their dishonest agendas furthered first as a matter of priority — exploiting this most recent tragedy to achieve a crooked political end even at the expense of the justice due the Gregorios.",Politics
Terrorist vs terrorist: Catfight between the communist Teddy Casino and convicted putschist Sonny Trillanes draws laughs,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/terrorist-vs-terrorist-catfight-between-the-communist-teddy-casino-and-convicted-putschist-sonny-trillanes-draws-laughs/,"Looking at the recent tiff between former “senator” and convicted coup leader Antonio Trillanes and the communist Teddy Casino, one need not dig deeper into the matter to get any further insight. The short of it is that both bozos are basically arguing on who made sumbong to the so-called “International Criminal Court” first.
The two little boys, however, miss the bigger point — that they both basically contradict just about every principle they claim to stand for.
Trillanes, for his part, claims to be a “democrat” — presumably one who upholds due process seen through within the legal and institutional frame of the Philippines’ democracy enshrined in its Constitution. As if it weren’t enough how, back in the mid-2000s, he sought to bulldoze over all that using illegally commandeered military resources (in the process endangering thousands of Filipino lives), he now admits to seeking the intervention of a “criminal court” organised by former imperialist powers to usurp the authority of the Philippines’ judiciary in what is clearly a domestic matter. No surprise then that Trillanes was exposed as fake democracy advocate by BBC journalist Stephen Sackur some time back.
The communist Teddy Casino, however, is the even bigger hypocrite. As a communist, Casino presumably lives by the standard communist ululation that all Philippine governments are “puppets” of the “American imperialists” that, together with the former colonial master, rule Filipinos as a “dictatorship”. Thus it is quite hilarious how Casino now rails against Trillanes’s “red-tagging” (aren’t communists Red, after all?) and how he, funny enough, also gleefully supports the prospect of the Western imperialist “International Criminal Court” parachuting into the Philippines to save the day.
Stepping back even further, it is heartwarming to see key “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition at each others’ throats even as the very important 2022 national elections loom in the horizon. It seems the Yellowtards and the Communists still fail to grasp just how popular a political force they need to go up against to seize power legally. Then again, considering the two morons in this episode — a convicted putschist and an endorser of a terrorist “revolution”, it is likely that achieving ends legally is not part of any brain-dead agendas here. As such, this is best regarded as the latest circus for those of us with more level heads to gloat over. Enjoy the show!",Politics
New Year’s resolution for Yellowtards and Reds: Stop HATING Duterte supporters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/new-years-resolution-for-yellowtards-and-reds-stop-hating-duterte-supporters/,"The year 2021 is an important year. This is because the campaign for the 2022 national elections will transpire over the greater part of this year. As such, an important resolution needs to be made by the Philippine Opposition if they truly aspire to legally seize power in 2022. They must stop hating their enemies and start understanding how they think.
The biggest challenge of the broader Philippine Opposition lies in the character of their “leaders”. The Yellowtards (the leading opposition bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists (the terrorist bloc within it gunning for violent ouster of any Philippine government) dominate the discourse of the Opposition. As a result, the collective discourse most associated with the Opposition has come to be characterised by hate, prejudice, and fundamentalism.
It is hateful because the only thing that “unifies” the Opposition at the moment is an irrational contempt for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his supporters. Unfortunately for the Opposition, it is this very hate that is clouding the judgement of their foremost “thought leaders” and blinding them to any opportunity to anticipate the movements of the forces they seek to defeat. Indeed, there is much to learn from intelligence gathered from behind enemy lines than from any of the shrill powow “rallies” populated by like-minded inbred amigas. However much of the Opposition “leadership” recoil from rather than apply healthy curiousity to their regard for the forces they need to beat. That’s a recipe for failure in any “fight” they see themselves engaging in.
The Opposition rhetoric is also prejudiced against people who think differently. This is ironic because liberals are supposedly advocates of inclusiveness, openness, and diversity. The Yellowtards and communists are anything but. Former president Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III, for example, King of the Yellowtards, rather than stand by the national colours, wore the yellow ribbon throughout his term. The communists, for their part, flew the Hammer and Sickle and bathed their ideological brand in bright red to set their crooked “revolutionary” lot apart from all the rest. In this behaviour, it becomes evident that their intent is to exclude rather than include.
One wonders then what it is exactly that the Yellowtards and communists share in the way of agendas. That makes the overall “leadership” of the Opposition they presume to take jointly suspect. Neither one of these two blocs are known to have ever been inclined to share the spoils of their respective “revolutions”. They’d just as soon slit one another’s throats the minute their shared enemy disappears from the scene.
And then there is the abject fundamentalism in the disturbing Yellowtard and communist character of the Philippine Opposition. The Opposition have a virtual Thought Police force on patrol day in and day out launching one Outrage Fad or another against anyone or anything seen to be heretical to their sacred “liberal” dogmas. They had all but conscripted much of Big Corporate Media to this cancel culture and enjoy the vast resources of this dishonest alliance to mount campaigns to marginalise any challenge to their prescribed schools of thought.
What the Yellowtards and communists seem unable to grasp, however, is how incoherent their axis is and how obsolete their infrastructure of deception had become. Firstly, Yellow and Red, mixed together, form the colour orange which is an apt colour that suits them the most where they are best situated. Yellowtards insist they are “pro democracy” while communists are violently opposed to it. Both worship throwback Cold War ideologies that are no longer relevant in an age where the ability to synthesise diverse thought is so technologically-enabled and effectively democratised that traditional monopolists of information — mainstream corporate media — now find themselves in an acute crisis of relevance. Therein that latter reality is evident the abject obsolescence of the Yellowtards’ infrastructure of disinformation. While the Yellowtards control Big Corporate Media and the communists control traditional university campus “journalism”, the reality of the rapid decline in their influence in the face of competition in the free market of ideas is inescapable.
Thus if the Opposition are really serious about winning back Filipinos, they need to reinvent themselves and ditch the baggage of Yellowtardism and communism that weigh them down. The most viable Opposition leader that needs to emerge in 2021 is one who is not stained by yellow or red and one who comes across as original and authentic. Both these virtues cannot be ascribed to the Yellowtards nor the communists as both are sad and smelly regurgitations of what have now been revealed to be dishonest and nonsensical narratives.
The Opposition in the crucial year that is 2021 need to resolve to get real. Filipinos deserve a real Opposition that can exhibit intelligent leadership. It is high time that the insult to their intelligence that is the Yellowtard- and communist-led one they merely put up with today is junked.",Politics
Making sense of Jonel Nuezca’s senseless killing of Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/making-sense-of-jonel-nuezcas-senseless-killing-of-sonya-and-frank-anthony-gregorio/,"It is easy to watch a viral video of the most recent police “killing” then jump into a “conclusion” that the Philippine police are “evil” and then go off to launch a whole media circus around it and propagate the latest outrage fad. The incident that left Sonya Gregorio and her son Frank Anthony Gregorio dead is a tragedy, but not necessarily one that allows anyone to soundly arrive at the conclusion that the Philippine National Police is an “evil” institution. But that’s exactly what the Philippine Opposition are fooling the Filipino people into believing.
This common sense regard for the crime perpetrated by police officer Jonel Nuezca did not stop the Philippine Opposition from politicising this incident beyond recognition. For the Yellowtards (the leading bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists, any position that is short of broadly painting the Philippine police as “evil” constitutes a “downplaying” of the public outrage this issue is entitled to. According to their “thought leaders”, people who attempt to point out the logical unsoundness of the notion that a duly-elected Philippine president deserves to be “ousted” as a result of these crimes deserves to be ridiculed as someone who is walang pakisama — a person who refuses to conform to a sentiment that is regarded to be right on the dubious merit of popular opinion alone.
The trouble with the Yellowtards and the communists lies in their overused partisan tradition. Both camps are renowned primarily for their “ouster” rhetoric — a tradition of using “mass action” and dishonestly packaging these as “revolutions” to further political agendas. As such, they are now known for their utterly devalued political modus operandi, forever scrounging around for isolated incidents as fodder for the outrage fads they are always looking to spark. Complementing this tactic is their blanket campaign to demonise state forces — the police and military — who are, in actual fact, the only forces capable of thwarting violent terrorist acts (in the case of the communist intent) or swinging an ouster campaign towards or away from success (in the case of the Yellowtard intent). If the top “thought leaders” of the Opposition could only be bothered to reflect on their tired approach to “change”, they will find that their style is succumbing to the law of diminishing returns — more is delivering incrementally less and less.
No surprise then that no critical gaps, dysfunctions, or opportunities in administration and governance are intelligently addressed in the Philippines in a sustainable manner. The problems that are at the centres of the Yellowtards’ and communists’ phony and pretentious rages are all problemns that transcend many governments. Police brutality, corruption, election cheating, nepotism, etcetera — all endemic with no one government addressing them at the systemic level. Yet here, yet again, we see the same tired old partisan camps armed with their obsolete ideologies and rhetoric packaging these as issues “unique” to the incumbent government they are railing against. One can only hope that these crooks can get away with this strategic insult to the intelligence of the Filipino people for only so long. Indeed, it is beginning to look like Filipinos have had enough of heated and re-heated inadobong Yellowtardism and communism year in and year out, president in and president out.
The brain-dead pattern is now quite readily recognisable. Crooked partisan groups like the Yellowtards and communists are always hovering around like vultures ready to feast on and regurgitate into their bankrupt political rhetoric any incident or idea that could be used as a tool for mass emotional blackmail. It leads one to question whether these people are genuinely looking for solutions, because it is quite evident that they only seek to escalate emotionalism at the expense of systematic thinking in order to cultivate fertile ground for “revolution”.
The sense in the killing of the Gregorios does not go beyond the criminal case and the hopeful resolution following due process via the criminal justice system ensrhined within the frame of the Consititution. If we are to mature as a society, this case-to-case address of acute incidents and their resolution within institutional measures should be made a habit — because measures that enforce systematic approaches to resolving issues are designed to ensure sound conclusions are reached upon which appropriate actions are taken. When deliberate action is always taken to escalate emotional responses around every incident, there will be no sound resolution and no incentive to focus on clear thinking. This is why, for example, the jeepney remains the social cancer that it is today in the Philippines. The contraption represents a triumph of haphazard emotion over engineered solutions. As long as Filipinos are encouraged by cancerous political blocs like the Yellowtards and communists to habitually apply emotional responses to problems that can routinely be solved by clear thinking (a discipline that any mature criminal justice system enforces), they will not progress.",Politics
Leni Robredo STILL foolishly believes she is “leader” of the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/leni-robredo-still-foolishly-believes-she-is-leader-of-the-philippine-opposition/,"By the end of December this year, there’ll be only 18 months to go before the next national elections in 2022. This means there are only just six months to go, more or less, before campaign season kicks off. As of now, it is still just Leni Robredo that the broader Philippine Opposition see as their “leader”. For her part, Robredo seems to have it in her head that she actually is the overall Opposition leader. One wonders then whether the loose coalition of Opposition camps are insane in continuing to put their bets on Robredo — clearly a politician too stupid to play competently in real high-stakes national politics — or have simply given up on a search for a leader strong and charismatic enough to go up against Brand Duterte.
Interestingly enough, the communists and their satellite “democratic” and “activist” fronts are quiet about the matter of Robredo’s “leadership”. Members of this major bloc within the Opposition refrain from expressing both direct support for and aversion to Robredo’s profile in the overall scheme of Opposition to the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Perhaps they are sitting on the fence which, to be fair, is something a political camp with a singular mission to destroy any legit government would do. The communist strategy of waiting for or actively inciting chaos to create an environment ripe for “revolution” likely hasn’t changed. So, like vultures, the communists simply wait and see with AK-47s locked and loaded. For now they simply sustain a tactical operating rhythm of pretending to be legal participants in the democratic process.
The likely scenario that will play out closer to when campaign season kicks off is the once solid-looking Philippine Opposition who are thus far united only by a desire to remove Duterte from office at all costs (even illegally if an opportinity to do so presents itself) will start to unravel as would-be presidentiables start to emerge from the woodwork. The community of opposition social media “influencers” who know no argument faculties beyond those based on personalities will then start to fragment and coalesce into loyalty cliques and “fandoms” revolving around one or the other presidentiable. Following that, Filipinos will once again be subject to the same sort of bobo political debate — one where personalities rather than ideas are pitted against each other.
Has the for-now key Opposition leader of the moment, “vice president” Leni Robredo, thought about her political strategy that far out? Quite unlikely given that she is also taking that all-too-familiar dishonest Coy Act where typical bozos like her, pressed to confirm an intent (or not) to run for office, defer to the “will of God” or, even cornier, the “will of the people” to decide their political fortunes. Politicians routinely insult their constituents’ intelligence that way. If Robredo truly had a vision for the Philippines and the ambition to build a strategy to see it realised and execute it as a national leader, we’d see a lot more commitment to a plan over the next 18 months than we are seeing today.
That a lame duck like Robredo is seen to be leader of a brain-dead Opposition is evidence that there is no viable alternative to Duterte at the moment — nothing that the Yellowtards (the bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) nor the communists could cough up. No one camp within the Opposition exhibits any clear strategy to win the coming 2022 elections. Perhaps this is why all the Opposition could come up with collectively is a call to “oust” Duterte. Seeing that they cannot have their way legally, they aim to take steps to seize power illegally. Perhaps this is the reason Leni Robredo remains the default “Opposition leader” — because she ultimately does not matter in the bigger scheme of things.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s BITTER response to her dismal Pulse Asia presidential survey ranking,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/leni-robredos-bitter-response-to-her-dismal-pulse-asia-presidential-survey-ranking/,"Philippine “vice president” Leni Robredo sucks even at sourgraping. It’s either that or she really needs to fire her PR team. Following a recently-released Pulse Asia survey on potential presidential candidates that could make a bid for the 2022 national elections in which Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte emerged as the top choice, Robredo’s office issued a sourgrapy statement insisting that there is no sourgraping on the part of the “vice president” over this survey result…
[Office of the Vice President (OVP)] spokesman Barry Gutierrez said Robredo’s office is not “paying much mind” to the said early survey results since the elections are still “a long way away.”
And then, wait for it, Gutierrez adds further that, “the VP is still focused on working to help our Filipinos get past the crisis of COVID-19, and recover from the calamities of the past few months”. Bingo, right? The old “for the Filipino people” card in all its clichéd glory played yet again. The Opposition really need to come up with a more innovative playbook if they hope to be the old “winnable” political force of yore.
The irony in the OVP statement seems to fly way above Robredo’s pointed talking heads. The whole spiel around Leni Robredo working as a servant “for the people” quite simply no longer works. The fact is, Robredo and her fandom spent much of 2020 on a PR campaign that is underpinned by the concept of a politician being “of service” to ordinary people “on the ground”. If they could be bothered to reflect on (rather than be all defensive about) this recent Pulse Asia report as a measure of how effective all that posturing was, they’d at least take the important lesson staring them in the face and take stock of the non-results of all that effort and spin. Unfortunately, no lessons have been learnt by the OVP. The fact that Gutierrez would respond to Robredo’s dismal Pulse Asia numbers by insisting that she will continue doing the same thing proves their incompetence in the PR game.
The Opposition need to cut their losses and stop investing in a loser.
There is no way Leni Robredo will ever lead the Opposition to a legal political victory. This is likely the reason that the Yellowtards (Robredo’s party and the bloc within the Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) are now in bed with the communists, are subscribed to their violent terrorist rhetoric, and are gleefully lapping up their dishonest Cold War Era “oust the president” ululations. Therein lies the crooked strategy of today’s Yellowtard-led Opposition:
If we can’t win power legally, we will seize power illegally.
It is interesting that none other than the Yellowtards themselves are busy chiseling away at the foundations of their very own 1987 Yellowtard Constitution. They see nothing short of the total collapse of Philippine democracy itself as their only hope for another shot at power. Perhaps this is their last chance seeing that Yellowtardism is in the throes of its dying gasps. This makes the Yellowtards even more dangerous and their alliance with the communists even more insidious. It’s time Filipinos stop putting up with this dishonest Opposition.
Leni Robredo by herself symbolises the rot at the heart of the crooked intelligence-insulting proposition the Opposition makes in its bid for power. The broader Opposition need to rethink this “leadership” Robredo presumes to exercise over their sorry lot.",Politics
Trump Presidency According to Charles Dickens,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/trump-presidency-according-to-charles-dickens/,"Charles Dickens wrote: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” Dickens may have very well foretold about what would become of the Trump administration in America when he published his book A Tale of Two Cities some 160 years ago. Donald J. Trump and his presidency certainly took America by storm, raised it to new heights, and left it devastatingly divided. No amount of attempt to suppress free speech in the name of “civility” (whatever that means in the age of the unholy alliance among the political establishment, liberal media and Big Tech) will ever deny the fact that president Trump has been one of the most (if not the most) colorful presidents in US history.
It would be a shame and wrong if Trump’s presidency will only be remembered for what happened at the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Blaming Trump for the siege of the Capitol building perpetrated by some of Trump’s supporters out of some hundred thousand people who attended the Save America rally in DC will simply miss a marvelous opportunity to look at the root cause of the chaos. We cannot expect the embrace of the “Blame Trump narrative” to pacify these people’s anger and frustration to force a way for the nation to unify. These people feel that they have been disenfranchised, marginalized and simply dismissed. Immediately after the November 3rd elections many of these people did not feel good about how the counting took place. Indeed, the last election has perhaps been one of the most controversial elections the country has had and there have been many accounts of electoral fraud, irregularities and anomalies that many of these people wanted to bring out but were simply dismissed, ridiculed and shunned. Many people felt that the elections weren’t on the up and up; I too (being familiar with the elections shenanigans that occur in the Philippines) did not feel right about how the ballots were counted in the contested swing states. But instead of giving their grievances and collected evidence the light of day, these were basically suppressed and discounted by Trump haters to be mere products of “tantrum by losers”.
For a couple of months many of these people have been trying to point out issues in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but Democrats and the media have ignored them and labeled them as conspiracy theorists. These people had, through their lawyers, thousands of affidavits and a few people were also willing to testify about what they have seen as wrong. They merely wanted their day in court. The state of Texas along with 17 other states including Florida, Georgia and Alabama, people from these states wanted to be heard in the Supreme Court as they wanted to point out what were wrong in the results from the states being contested. Instead of being heard and giving these people their day in court, their cases were simply dismissed not for lack of merit but for lack of standing since state courts, not the federal Supreme Court, ought to hear the case. State Democrats, instead of sitting down with these people and trying to convince these people that the elections were conducted and counted fairly through a careful review of the evidence presented as well as a thorough audit of the ballots, these people’s cases were simply disregarded. To merely accept the result of a highly controversial election is a tough pill to swallow for these people given that Democrats spent 3 long years investigating a Russia collusion hoax but now are unwilling to investigate electoral fraud allegations. It would have made a lot of difference and would have pacified a lot of anger and frustration had these people been heard and had the contested ballots been thoroughly and independently audited.
We have to realize that many of Trump’s supporters support him not because he is “The Donald” but because Donald Trump actually fought for many of the things they believed in. Donald Trump gave these people a powerful voice that the prevailing cultural deities in government establishment, media and cyberspace simply could not stand. Donald Trump was not afraid of the Party establishment, the liberal media and Big Tech. Trump personified the fight many of these people wanted to give to the elites but were not able to give. To ignore or simply dismiss Trump’s electoral fight is tantamount to ignoring and dismissing many of his supporters’ sentiments. Outright dismissal of people’s sentiments and cases is what makes people angry and this is not just about the elections but in all other aspects of life and beliefs. Under the prevailing culture dominated by the left, if a person’s beliefs do not conform with the left’s agenda and narrative then this person gets mocked, ruined and cancelled. To disagree in abortion because of one’s belief in the sanctity of life makes one a religious bigot. To believe that it is unfair for biological males to compete in female sports or that biological males should not be allowed to use girls’ bathrooms makes one a homophobe. To insist that immigrants ought to come to America legally and through merit makes one a xenophobe. To prefer to say All Lives Matter instead of Black Lives Matter makes one a racist. Many people are simply fed up about all these and many of these people feel that cheating their hero out of the presidency is equivalent to them being cheated out of having a voice.
To blame Trump and to suppress his (and his followers’) views and grievances will only make things worse. GRP webmaster benign0 put it simply as “..it is likely that blocking Trump would be the equivalent of putting a lid on a cauldron that is boiling over. What is more important to consider is what to do about the fire underneath that cauldron. … Is Trump the fire that brought many Americans to a boiling point today? Or was that fire burning long before Trump even considered the American presidency back in the lead up to the 2016 presidential elections? This is the real question Americans need to answer.” The question is profound, of course. But in addition, how exactly do we put out the fire?
So how do we deal with the fire? Would keeping a lid on the cauldron get rid of the risk of a blowup or should we work on putting out the fire? If it is the latter, how do we do this if we prevent the conditions conducive to contain the fire and being smothered through discussion and understanding to resolve differences? How do we put out the fire if Trump supporters are expected to stay quiet while the other side airbrushes all of the great things Trump has done for the people and for the country? Would denying credit for the Trump administration having achieved the best economy with the lowest unemployment in modern times where Blacks and other minorities being the biggest winners work? Would denying credit for his administration’s deregulation resulting in reduction of costly business red tape restrictions do the job? Would reversing the Trump administration’s business-boosting tax cuts promote unity? No? Then perhaps the reversal of Trump’s energy policies that unleashed industry production that created tens of thousands of jobs and making America independent of foreign oil supplies and pricing controls would! Maybe that will do the trick, right? Still “No”? Then how about stripping Trump of credit on the First Step Act that lessened the over-incarceration of minorities (91% Blacks) resulting in their sentencing reduction and paving the way to the release of thousands of Black prison inmates giving them another chance in life? Should we maintain that Trump is a racist and go back to Biden’s law in 1994 that caused the mass incarceration of Blacks? Maybe switch the credit for good measure? Give Biden credit for the First Step Act and Trump the 1994 Biden Crime Law? If that is not a good idea then maybe we can smother the fire if we agree to reverse Trump’s foreign policies where NATO countries were made to pay their fair share of the cost? How about Trump’s Middle East policies that led to Israel finally having peace accords achieving normalized relations with multiple Arab nations? Should subscribing to Biden’s policy of appeasing Palestine and Iran make everyone agree to unify? Then we go to the handling of the Covid-19 (as Trump likes to say “China Virus”), should we go back to calling him a xenophobe for overruling “experts” to ban travel from China? Should we simply forget that he established a National Coronavirus Task Force, invoked the Defense Production Act to provide all medical equipment needed to respond to the crisis, implemented a massive national testing program, and organized the Operation Warp Speed program that helped produce and distribute effective promising vaccines and therapies in a historically unprecedentedly short time?
I guess what I am trying to say is that: “Would vilifying and canceling Trump (and his supporters) be the key to unify America?”
Of course, it is also correct to say that Trump did have many follies as well and these were primarily rooted on his big ego. Yes, he had a huge ego problem and to a larger extent, Trump really did become his own biggest enemy! His ego largely caused his demise and I am sure this is a cross he will be bearing for the rest of his life as he looks back at his life’s and his presidency’s triumphs and tragedies. It really is sad to see a man who has done so many great things for the country and its people but will be looked at as a man who also contributed to further divide the nation because he couldn’t temper his ego. It seems fitting to think that Charles Dickens may have also aptly captured the tragic end of Trump’s presidency when he wrote:
“Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.”

"Inday Sara Duterte tops Pulse Asia presidential survey, Yellowtards on edge!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/inday-sara-duterte-tops-pulse-asia-presidential-survey-yellowtards-on-edge/,"If the Philippine Opposition are still in denial that they are nowhere near as prepared and as organised as they ought to be in the lead up to the 2022 election, the latest Pulse Asia Survey results should be a wake up call. Topping the list is Inday Sara Duterte, mayor of Davao City and daughter to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
CNN Philippines reports…
Pulse Asia Research’s November 2020 Ulat ng Bayan national survey showed 26% of the 2,400 respondents polled nationwide said they would vote for Mayor Duterte should the elections be held today.
The numbers were highest in Mindanao (58%) and lowest in Balance Luzon (12%). The National Capital Region registered 16%.
Former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., Senator Grace Poe, Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso, and Senator Manny Pacquiao rounded out the top five choices.
Vice President Leni Robredo was the sixth top choice for president.
This is further proof that Filipino voters no longer go for the dominant Opposition narratives of Yellowtard “for the people” rhetoric dished out by “suffering servant” personas coming down from the hill to rescue “the poor” from the clutches of “tyranny”. Filipinos are looking for leaders, not saints. They are looking for executives, not pretentious “doers”. Most important of all, Filipinos need a leader with vision and a consistent set of principles that support a strategy to realise it.
Unfortunately, much of the Opposition response to this latest survey, as usual, revolves around questioning or even challenging its methodology and the reliability of the resulting findings. In doing so, they miss the important point — that regardless of what surveys like these tell us, the fact is that there are obvious things that the Opposition need to work on to get into a good position for the campaign leading to the 2022 national elections.
Even then, let’s say there is reason to second guess the Pulse Asia report, for argument’s sake. Are the results significant enough to be cause for worry for the Yellowtards? Surveys are just guides and use sampling methods that are statistical compromises to the impractical alternative of polling every single registered voter. Indeed, the level of confidence with which one can regard the output of these surveys can be calculated. Often, a sample size is used that is sufficient to be representative of the population at 95 percent confidence (or within plus or minus 5 percent error margin). If, say, two competing politicians are shown to have approval ratings that vary within less than five percent of each other, then the difference can be said to be not statistically significant. In such case, one cannot soundly conclude which of the two has a higher (or lower) rating than the other.
In the case of this particular report, on the other hand, the key Opposition bet, Yellowtard politician and current “vice president” Leni Robredo lags behind even her closest rival, boxing champ Manny Pacquiao by a factor way beyond the +/-5% expected sampling error built into most reasonable survey methods. Thus, it is likely that surveys conducted in a relatively less-sound manner to that used by an established firm such as Pulse Asia would also yield dismal numbers for Robredo.
Regardless of any of that, the message to the Philippine Opposition is clear. There’s lots of work to be done if they are serious about seizing power legally in the coming elections. It could easily start with ditching the Yellowtards and the communists from their coalition and crafting a compelling narrative that is free of all the idiotic pretense that infests the ideologies of those two traditionally dominant blocs.
There is a smart way to dissent. And then there is the obsolete borderline moronic approach to “dissent” of the Yellowtards and communists. A viable Opposition to the Duterte government needs to step up and out of that entrenched malaise of intelligence-insulting drivel preferred by these traditional Opposition blocs and come up with something new and something original that Filipinos could respond intelligently to.",Politics
Just because Bongbong Marcos’s poll protest was junked does not make Leni Robredo fit to be President,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/just-because-bongbong-marcoss-poll-protest-was-junked-does-not-make-leni-robredo-fit-to-be-president/,"After several years of languishing in the justice system, vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos’s poll protest was reportedly dismissed by the Supreme Court. Rappler “reports” on Twitter, “In unanimous vote, Supreme Court junks electoral protest filed by defeated candidate Bongbong Marcos against Vice President Leni Robredo, concluding more than 4 years of litigation of the SC.” As expected the Opposition — particularly the Yellowtards (the bloc within it rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) — are ecstatic.
This is bad news for the broader Opposition. The euphoria will likely heighten the quaint illusion that “vice president” Leni Robredo is fit to lead the entire Philippine Opposition in its bid to beat the popular incumbent’s camp in the coming 2022 elections. The communists, for example, are not happy with this prospect. Noted “activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago, for one, sees Robredo as irrevocably tainted by the Yellowtard brand and, as such, more a liability than an asset to their singular goal of seizing power in 2022…
Good luck with that opinion — one which will likely be unpopular with the chi chi powers-that-be of the mighty Liberal Party of the Philippines who see their lot as the presumptive “leaders” of the Philippine Opposition and their “hero” as The One who is set to “unite” their people…
One wonders too whether former COMELEC Chairman Andy Bautista who reportedly fled the country amid allegations of electoral fraud back in 2016 will return to the Philippines now that he feels he has been vindicated…
It remains to be seen whether this “win” as far as the Opposition are concerned — specifically the Yellowtard bloc within — will translate to a win in the bigger scheme of things. The 2022 elections are just around the corner and it remains debatable as to whether the Opposition are closer to any semblance of the “unity” they need to put up a credible challenge to whoever is endorsed as the administration candidate by President Rodrigo Duterte who remains popular among Filipinos. The clock is ticking.",Politics
Lynching Trump,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/lynching-trump/,"In the aftermath of the attack on the United States Capitol building last January 6 by some of US President Donald Trump’s supporters, many people condemned Trump for having been the cause of the attack. The Democrats wasted no second in condemning Trump. The media, like clockwork, immediately sang like a Democrat choir in lambasting Trump and even many from Trump’s own political party (the Republicans) joined in the fray by turning their backs on the one who singlehandedly gave excitement to the dull as rusted nails Republican party. The gods of Silicon Valley dropped the hammer on the president. Almost in one fell swoop, the president and many of his supporters were banned from social media platforms depriving many people of platforms to freely speak and express themselves. Trump and many of his supporters were also punished by having their businesses removed from marketing and sales platforms such as Shopify. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got the ball rolling to initiate impeachment proceedings in Congress to charge Trump for “Incitement of Insurrection”, despite Trump only having less than 9 days left in office. It certainly looks like the lynching of Donald Trump has begun and the Democrats are getting the noose ready for his execution, figuratively or otherwise.
But hold on for just a minute here. Does Trump deserve the beating he is receiving from the sanctimonious Democrats, a few Republicans, the media, and Big Tech? Is the hanging of Trump and his supporters justified? If so, on what basis? Trump certainly deserves criticism on his incendiary speech. It was egotistical and reckless. Trump’s signature behavior has always been outrageous and irresponsible but does being outrageous and irresponsible necessarily translate to an incitement to an insurrection as charged by his detractors and haters? Let’s analyze.
Under the law, “to incite a riot” means:
“…to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot, which includes, but is not limited to, urging or instigating other persons to riot, but shall not be deemed to mean the mere oral or written (1) advocacy of ideas or (2) expression of belief, not involving advocacy of any act or acts of violence or assertion of the rightness of, or the right to commit, any such act or acts.”
If we look at the transcript of Trump’s speech where his alleged crime was supposed to have materialized, we see that nowhere in the entire speech can we find anything that shows that his comments directed at an outcome of insurrection, or the destruction of life and property at the US Capitol building. In fact, at around 18:16 in his speech, we see that he said:
“We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”
Trump ended his speech with:
“So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats are hopeless. They’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all for being here, this is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.”
As we can see, Trump did not incite a riot as defined by law, let alone incite an insurrection. He even told his supporters to stay peaceful and advocated for respecting Law and Order and the police. He also told his supporters to “Go home” when things started to get heated at the Capitol building.
If his careless and inflammatory speech qualifies as such, then there ought to be a few folks worthy of being charged to incite a riot, perhaps even the very same folks who are condemning Trump. We have certainly seen and heard a few of these folks seem to have encouraged violence, harassment, mayhem and destruction of life and property that resulted in such over the course of president Trump’s term. Democrat megastar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself, certainly rationalized riots.
The thing is, I believe jurisprudence is on the side of Trump. Of course, impeachment is a political exercise and jurisprudence would not matter to a bunch of bloodthirsty partisans but if we focus on just the law, I believe the allegations of crime against Trump regarding the Jan. 6 event do not hold water.
Case in point, a federal judge dismissed an “incitement to riot” case filed against alleged Black Lives Matter leader DeRay Mckesson because the judge concluded that Mckesson “solely engaged in protected speech”. The case involved a riot that ensued against the police in Louisiana at a Black Lives Matter protest after Alton Sterling, a black man, was shot by a white police officer.
Okay, so if Trump did not exactly “incite a riot” nor “incite an insurrection”, then perhaps he can be charged for advocating an illegal behavior. But did he really do that? Let’s take the case of Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969. Now this case involved Ku Klux Klan leader, Clarence Brandenburg, for advocating violence in the service of a political cause! Brandenburg said:
“This is an organizers’ meeting. We have had quite a few members here today which are – we have hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State of Ohio. I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the Columbus, Ohio Dispatch, five weeks ago Sunday morning. The Klan has more members in the State of Ohio than does any other organization. We’re not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it’s possible that there might have to be some revengeance taken.
“We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong. From there we are dividing into two groups, one group to march on St. Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi. Thank you.”
The Supreme Court ruled that Brandenburg’s speech was protected by the First Amendment. The ruling of the Court stated:
“The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press, do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”
Looking back at Trump’s speech, was his speech likely to incite or produce imminent lawless action? Sure, at least perhaps by some of his supporters present at the rally. But was Trump’s speech directed at producing imminent lawless action? The evidence does not appear to support that.
This is the problem with the case of Trump haters who are eager to lynch the president. Idiots who want to skin Trump alive are committing the logical fallacy called “post hoc ergo propter hoc”.  This fallacy occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before that event. Trump gave an inflammatory speech criticizing the Senate and the House of Representatives for certifying the result of an anomalous election then afterwards all hell broke loose as some of his supporters marched to the Capitol building and wreaked havoc. Can we assume that the chronology of events determines cause? If a rooster crows before sunrise, does this mean the rooster caused the sun to rise?
It’s amazing how many of Trump hating partisans have the audacity to condemn Trump for the very same thing they accuse him of doing. It’s amazing how stupid their useful idiots are for parroting the Democratic party’s talking points when even upon the most superficial scrutiny, the charges and accusations against Trump would fold like a cheap pair of shoes.

Driving Donald Trump’s supporters underground is a dangerous thing,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/driving-donald-trumps-supporters-underground-is-a-dangerous-thing/,"In the last few days since the infamy of the Washington DC “insurrection” purportedly fuelled by US President Donald Trump’s messages sent over Twitter and other social media platforms, I’ve been seeing social media posts and various articles on news sites and blogs describing its aftermath. The interesting ones I’ve noted are those to do with how the Establishment has started to clamp down on the ability of Trump’s supporters and Trump himself to connect with one another over traditional social media and consumer digital devices. Notable of all is how the current go-to of the “far right” — social media site Parler — is being starved of essential services that keep its lights on as its infrastructure providers shut it down and distribution services like Google and Apple stores delist its mobile apps. Various payments services have also stopped processing payments to Trump’s campaign websites and other financial services will likely start to apply greater scrutiny to financial transactions associated with the broader ecosystem of conservative groups and movements.
Partisans on the other side of the spectrum are, as expected, enjoying their moment of schadenfreude as they revel in news of the suffering to the “bad guys” this is all causing. That’s fair, considering they had been marginalised “victims” of four years of the Trump administration (or so they felt they were). However, even as they go about their revelry, it is evident that worry is creeping in to spoil their party as they increasingly lose sight of these “bad guys” and wonder as to what might happen next as “impolite” conversations are driven out of mainstream digital communities and private — even analog — networking options are explored by some conservative blocs to continue their chatter.
Indeed, the more important thing to consider now is what happens next. Jim VandeHei writes about a “new reality”  of Three Americas, “blue America, red America, and Trump America — all with distinct politics, social networks and media channels.” More disturbingly…
Parts of Trump America, canceled by Twitter and so many others, are severing their ties to the realities of the other Americas, and basically going underground. There will be less awareness and perhaps scrutiny of what’s being said and done.
Indeed, this is cancel culture taken to its logical conclusion. Whereas, in the last, cancel culture has mostly targetted specific events, brands, individuals, or character traits, it now applies a broad arbitrary brush to what likely is a significant chunk of the 74 million Americans who voted for Trump in this year’s elections. Even discounting those who would have been turned off to Trump following his astounding behaviour in the lead up to the “insurrection”, I’d be cautious about outright dismissing the continued significance of Trump’s supporter base.
New York Times‘ Will Wilkinson asked the question “Why Did So Many Americans Vote for Trump?” just after the the elections closed but the question may well have to be pondered for months — even years — to come. This is specially so now that Trump and his people are going underground on account of their being cancelledt by “decent” Americans.
Among other things, Wilkinson points out, “Democrats needed to present a competing, compelling strategy to counter Republican messaging.” But…
Instead, they whined that Mr. Trump’s negligence and incompetence were to blame for America’s economic woes and complained that Mitch McConnell wouldn’t even consider the House’s big relief bill. They weren’t wrong, but correctly assigning culpability did nothing to help working-class breadwinners who can’t bus tables, process chickens, sell smoothies or clean hotel rooms over Zoom.
A failure to compete. Sounds familiar, right?
If the winning team kicks the “losers” off and locks them out of the playing field, they leave themselves no choice other than to play with themselves and, as a result, literally go blind doing just that.

Is there no Opposition leader other than Leni Robredo?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/is-there-no-opposition-leader-other-than-leni-robredo/,"Tick tock tick tock. The 2022 elections are just around the corner and all the venerable “thought leaders” of the Opposition could do is gush about the latest PR stunt of “vice president” Leni Robredo and defend her pale spaghetti sensibilities. You’d think a country of more than 100 million could come up with even one Opposition leader who could give the enormously popular incumbent, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a run for his money. But no. All there is at the moment is Leni.
It boggles the mind as to just how bankrupt the Opposition are. They are bankrupt ideologically and they are bankrupt human-resource-wise. All its esteemed members do is stumble from one outrage fad after another and latch on to the most recent “trending” flypaper issue of the week in between Pinoy Big Brother evictions. All the while, no platform, vision, nor roadmap is forthcoming. No election winning strategy. There is even no new catchphrase or hand gesture to replace “Daang Matuwid” nor that “L” loser salute.
So how in the world will the Opposition beat Duterte in 2022?
“Helping the poor” is so last century. And yet “helping” remains the brain-dead cornerstone call to action of the Yellowtards (Robredo’s camp) and, of course, the communists, the latter having spent the last century suckering the world into believing that theirs is a “cause” championing the “oppressed” and “have-nots” of this world. Having been caught up as a bunch of liars, it is baffling that they continue to plan to set themselves up for failure building their proposition to Filipino voters upon such dishonest foundations.
And what of mainstream Big Corporate Media? They make up a sad sunset industry still believing their “news” desks remain the go-to brokers or of facts for mass consumption. They have no choice but to depend on intellectually-degrading content they call “entertainment” for the ad revenues they need to mass-signal their pretentious virtue. It is the world’s biggest irony that today’s Opposition remain imprisoned in a diseased symbiotic relationship with these mass communication perversions. Working together, they are not out to assure Filipinos their democratic freedom but rather seek to stubbornly protect the monopoly over the political narrative they once held.
The reason the Opposition struggle to find a leader who is as dumb enough as Robredo to vie for the presidency under their obsolete flags is because no politician who has half a brain would touch the rhetoric they will be required to parrot on the campaign trail. Perhaps then, the next leader of the Opposition is out there somewhere, but he or she will likely not emerge from nor be molded within the chi chi soirees and echo chambers of the current Opposition camps as we know them. In short, Leni Robredo is a dead-end bet. If a genuine opposition is serious about alternatives, it should begin by crafting new thinking and new narratives that can inspire Filipinos rather than insult their intelligence.",Politics
Is using “Madumb” to address Philippine “vice president” Leni Robredo justified?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/is-using-madumb-to-address-philippine-vice-president-leni-robredo-justified/,"Normally, a top female official of the Philippine Government is addressed as “Madam” out of respect. Lately, however, we’ve been seeing current “vice president” Leni Robredo being addressed as “Madumb” — a play on the words “madam” and “dumb”. This is likely an outcome of some confusion on the part of many Filipinos as to how one should regard a title that normally commands respect but, at the same time is filled by a person who has so far exhibited behaviour that erodes respect.
Based on recent surveys, it is quite evident that Robredo is suffering what seems to be an irreversible decline in the respect and confidence she attracts from the Filipino public. A recent popularity survey conducted by Pulse Asia put Robredo at “the second to the lowest rating among the 5 top officials”. Even more disturbing is the manner with which Robredo’s Office of the Vice President (OVP) merely dismissed these survey findings insisting that elections are still “a long way away” and that “the VP is still focused on working to help our Filipinos get past the crisis of COVID-19, and recover from the calamities of the past few months”.
Does that necessarily mean Robredo is dumb?
Perhaps not. Although popularity is essential to seizing power in a “democracy” such as the Philippines, there are many people who are qualified leaders who do not win that game. Look no further back than the ascent to power of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III in 2010 and it becomes clear that dumb won over intelligence in that instance. Unfair, right? But that’s democracy for you. Popularity wins in a democracy. In that sense, Robredo’s alleged dumbness does not necessarily make her less viable as a person who could lead the Opposition to an electoral victory in 2022.
What created and continues to add to the impression that Robredo is “dumb” more likely comes from how she projects herself under the harsh glow of the media spotlight. Robredo’s public relations (PR) team have sought this spotlight aggressively but had evidently not shown much competence crafting good messaging and theatrics and prepping and coaching their client to ensure her appearances elicit the “right” responses from the public. Indeed, if said PR team were actually truly worth their salt, they could even have turned Robredo’s perceived dumbness into an asset — much the same way as good poker players are able to convert a bad hand dealt to them into a win. Marilyn Monroe, for example, is one of Hollywood’s greatest celebrities and, though reportedly fairly intelligent in real life, successfully pulled off her “dumb blonde” act. To be fair, life did deal Monroe a pretty awesome hand that gave her all the right assets to make it big in Hollywood. This raises the question as to whether or not the “dumb” act is right for Leni Robredo.
Indeed, covering Robredo is hard work. Because she prefers to speak in “Taglish” (a kind of pidgin language popular in the Philippines), her sound bytes often need to be translated to normal English by news editors. And because she lacks any semblance of a vision or strategic roadmap she could potentially apply to presidential campaign, there is not much that more high-end columnists and analysts could work with when writing “intelligent” political commentary about her. Even her most rabid cheerleaders in mainstream Big Corporate media like Maria Ressa of Rappler and “investigative journalist” Raissa Robles evidently struggle to cough up the goods.
Maria Ressa interviewing Robredo back in 2016 clearly had lots of air to fill specially when she quizzed Robredo at the beginning of the conversation. Ressa asked Robredo “what has changed in the Philippines?” from the time she supposedly won the vice presidency and qualified the question further saying “let’s talk big picture first”. To that question, Robredo could only stammer out an incoherent response frequently peppering her sentences with “I don’t know”. Her most substantial answer was, “It seems like we are in a very different sphere already in the sense that so much of what is happening now I couldn’t imagine to have happened in 2010”. Check out the segment from 2:09 to 3:10 in the following video.
For her part, Raissa Robles has spent the better part of Robredo’s term merely parroting the vice presidential sound bytes and not much else — certainly not much in the way of providing her readers any real insight on just what sort of president Robredo would be if she successfully pulled off a win in 2022. In one of her more recent “reports” involving Robredo, all the Professor could really tell us is that “Vice-President Leni Robredo criticised the president’s reliance on a Chinese vaccine, saying more needed to be done to stem the spread of the virus”. Aren’t we all glad Robles is around to tell us these things?
Suffice to say perhaps the only really unfair aspect of the public perception that “vice president” is “dumb” is that you need to be a true virtuouso makeup artist to do a winning PR job on Leni Robredo. Ressa’s 2010 interview of Robredo was a case in point. You could tell from Ressa’s hand gestures and tone of voice that she was just short of directly prompting Robredo with specific words to say. Interestingly enough a key takeaway from that interview was this gem…
“I’m now in a position to make dreams happen. In the sense that there was so much I wanted to do before but my power and my authority was limited and now I’m in a position where I can get things done,” she said.
Interesting because one of the first dumb things Robredo did was to fall out of Duterte’s favour thanks to her being unable to step up to the task of government and let go of her former role as Opposition partisan back then. For example, rather than air her gripes as to why she had failed to deliver any results as Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) chairperson at the time, she opted to routinely make sumbong to the media. Not surprisingly, Filipinos have since learned to see past this routine drama of hers and have increasingly described her as a “media whore” who remains stuck in campaign mode despite already being the presumptive “vice president”. That eventually led to her being kicked out of Duterte’s cabinet and effectively sidelined. If Robredo was actually serious about acquiring the “power” to “make dreams happen”, her access to the centre of power where things happen should have been the first thing she should have secured.
Does the title “Madumb” fit the bill as far as “vice president” Leni Robredo is concerned? It’s hard to argue that it doesn’t. The Opposition need to reassess their options and really think about whether this “dumb” act will fly over the coming campaign months leading to the 2022 national elections.",Politics
‘Pork Barrel Queen’ Janet Lim Napoles convicted but the buck stopped with Aquino in 2013,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/pork-barrel-queen-janet-lim-napoles-convicted-but-the-buck-stopped-with-aquino-in-2013/,"After years of muddling through the Philippines’ “justice” system, some progress in the crackdown on pork barrel politics has finally been made. Janet Lim Napoles now reportedly faces “jail time of 12 to 18 years for each count of malversation” after the Sandiganbayan ruled  “Napoles, [former Cagayan de Oro representative Constantino Jaraula], and three others […] guilty of committing three counts of graft and three counts malversation charges for pocketing at least P19.2 million of the lawmaker’s Priority Development Assistance Fund allocation”.
But is that the end of what the Philippines’ National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) described as “the mother of all scams” back in 2013? At the time, the estimate of what was allegedly stolen was nothing short of enormous. Allegations that up to Php10 billion was siphoned off by a syndicate into dummy firms rocked the foundations of both chambers of Philippine Congress back then. Linked to the scandal were no less than five senators and 23 congressmen. Was it a racket knowingly or unwittingly participated in by the 28 law makers? That still remains to be determined.
The news first broke in the Inquirer.net which over a four-part series of articles revealed the extent of the scam allegedly perpetrated by a certain Janet Lim Napoles, CEO of trading firm JLN Corporation. The series of stories ran by the Inquirer.net are as follows (key excerpts quoted for each):
NBI probes P10-B scam (Fri, 12 Jul 2013)
JLN stands for Janet Lim Napoles, who has been identified as the alleged brains behind the racket. She runs the company with her brother, Reynald “Jojo” Lim.
The sworn affidavits—prepared by six whistle-blowers with the assistance of their lawyer, Levito Baligod, and submitted to the NBI—stated that JLN Corp., with offices on the 25th floor of Discovery Suites in Ortigas Center in Pasig City, had defrauded the government of billions of pesos in ghost projects involving the creation of at least 20 bogus nongovernment organizations. These NGOs were supposedly the ultimate recipients of the state funds, but the money went to Napoles, according to the affidavits of the six whistle-blowers.
‘I am not involved in any scam’ (Sat, 13 Jul 2013)
Janet Lim-Napoles, who first appeared on the radar screen of whistle-blowers in 2001, has dismissed as a “product of lies,” allegations she engineered a P10-billion scam over the past decade using mainly pork barrel funds of senators and congressmen for ghost projects.
In an affidavit prepared by the MOST law firm, the 49-year-old trader said she and her company, JLN Corp., had “never transacted business or closed deals with the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.”
“I certainly was not involved in any of the high-profile scams which occurred during the previous administration,” she said […]
How P10-B racket works (Sun, 14 Jul 2013)
The scheme involved the Malampaya funds, the fertilizer fund and the lawmakers’ allotments from the priority development assistance fund (PDAF), or pork barrel.
[…]
Napoles and her company had been trading agricultural products since 2000 until she reportedly discovered in 2003 a quicker scheme to make money, her former employees said in interviews and affidavits submitted to the National Bureau of Investigation, which is looking into her activities.
For such a high-stakes racket, the modus operandi was surprisingly simple, the INQUIRER has learned.
Napoles, who allegedly ran the racket from unit 2502 of Discovery Suites in Ortigas Center, Pasig City, established foundations or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to serve as recipients of the funds and named her own employees, including a nanny, as presidents of these outfits.
The funds, which were deposited in the foundations’ bank accounts, were eventually remitted to her to be split between her and the lawmaker whose PDAF allotment was used, or the official of the state agency involved.
28 solons linked to scam (Mon, 15 Jul 2013)
Sen. Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. topped the list of lawmakers who were said to have allowed the use of their Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) to the scheme allegedly hatched by Janet Lim-Napoles, president and CEO of the trading firm JLN Corp., according to the documents secured by the Inquirer.
Revilla gave the syndicate access to his PDAF, or pork barrel, to dummy NGOs formed by Napoles and registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission in 22 instances; followed by Senators Juan Ponce Enrile on 21 occasions; Jinggoy Estrada, 18 times; Ferdinand Marcos Jr., four; and Gringo Honasan, once with a small amount.
[…]
Topping the list of 23 House representatives is Rizalina Seachon-Lanete of Masbate’s third district, who allowed her pork to be used 13 times; followed by Conrado Estrella III of Pangasinan’s 6th district and Rodolfo Plaza of Agusan del Sur, both nine occasions; and Samuel Dangwa, of Benguet, eight.
Interestingly, pork barrel funds have long been seen to be an obvious source of corruption in Philippine politics. Under the pork barrel system, each senator enjoys an allocation of P200 million from the national budget while each member of the House of Representatives receives P70 million. Each one has full authority to decide how these funds are used to “assist” their respective constituencies. Because Malacañang has control over the formulation of the national budget and the release of the PDAF allocation included in the budget, some influence over the behaviour of members of Congress can be exerted by the President.
As Neal Cruz pointed out in his piece on the issue…
I am sure that President Aquino, the self-proclaimed nemesis of graft and corruption, has again submitted to Congress a budget for next year that includes the hated PDAF.
Why do the presidents do it? Because it is a means of making the legislators do what the president wants. Cooperative legislators get their pork allocations quickly; uncooperative ones don’t get theirs as quickly. The pork is a sort of carrot-and-stick for the legislators. In short, the pork is a bribe by the President to members of Congress. Because of the pork, presidents, including President Aquino, are guilty of bribery.
Clearly, this pork barrel “scam” is a product of a systemic issue within which Napoles was but one cog in a vast kleptocratic clockwork. The deeply-institutionalised thievery that is Philippine-style pork barrel politics has the following key components in its gravy train:
The President of the Philippines – who formulates the National Budget and consistently includes the pork barrel as a significant chunk of it year in and year out.
Philippine Congress – the state body that, amazingly, approves the National Budget, a big chunk of which involves the very funds that end up in its members’ secret bank accounts.
The Philippines’ financial system – a black-box conduit for mob funds that is hopelessly convoluted by archaic secrecy laws, lax and corrupt regulatory bodies, and tight family ties (many with links to the very law enforcement offices currently “investigating” this case) that greases the cogs.
Where did Napoles fit in the above?
Whatever the answer to that question is does not really matter. She is all but one item in what should have been a long list of persons of interest in this case — perhaps one that likely included bank executives, NGO managers and sponsors, senators and House representatives, and last but certainly not the least, then President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III himself. The latter is where the buck stopped as the old cliche goes. BS Aquino, after all, was the man who submitted the National Budget proposal and, as such, was the ultimate originator of the pork barrel allocations to begin with. This is the very same man who back in 2010 prematurely trumpeted his place in history as the country’s unprecedented Corruption Killer. Midway through his term, it had become evident that Aquino was living up to his two-letter initials.
Grace Pulido-Tan, then chairman of the Commission on Audit, in a media conference she called shortly after releasing their audit report on Congress’s use of pork barrel funds confirmed what Filipinos had long suspected — that the national scam is deeply systemic to governance in the country and far far bigger than “the Janet Lim Napoles issue”…
Pressed to capture in one word what the special audit – on pork barrel releases from 2007 to 2009 – found, Pulido-Tan replied: “Kahindik-hindik.” In English, “Disgusting”.
Pulido-Tan said the misuse of the billions became possible because of a combination of corruption and the failure of national government agencies, lawmakers’ offices, and lapses by the Department of Budget and Management itself, which did not follow its own rules in some cases. She also said there was widespread disregard for rules that appeared loose to begin with.
Confirmed too was the role media plays in engineering confusion and misguidance in the public in order to protect politicians who happen to bask in Big Media’s favour or demonise people so that they serve as decoys and distractions to the real issues surrounding pork barrel thievery. Media watchdog Spin Busters, for one, examined the details of the COA report and noted how legislators who had worked closely with Malacañang had been conveniently left out in the “exposés” and “scoops” issued in recent weeks by the country’s major news organisations.
[Iloilo Rep. Niel] Tupas [who was chief prosecutor in the impeachment trial against former Chief Justice Renato Corona] was tagged by COA in questionable NGO deals worth P542 million along with fellow BS Aquino BFF, Joel Villanueva, now the head of TESDA. Also, Edgardo Angara, father of Sonny Angara, who won a Senate seat on the Yellow ticket last May. COA was deeply suspicious of old man Angara’s P81.55-million financial assistance to a pet NGO and a P14-million feeding program with another NGO where he’s, uhm, an incorporator. That looks like the Napoles business model: cultivate a cottage industry of paper NGOs and monopolize the pork barrel pipeline.
Funny how quickly the tables turn on the sneaky business that is Philippine “journalism” as Spin Busters observed back then…
Now that COA chief Grace Pulido-Tan let the cat out of the bag, [the Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) is] forced to report about the widening scope of the pork scam. Thanks to Gil Cabacungan, even if his reputation precedes him, for incessantly pitching the story about BS cabinet exec Proceso Alcala’s own meat processing operation to a PDI newsdesk that’s always looked the other way.
Don’t be surprised about the apparent PDI “news management,” one that contains the damage to Napoles and steers clear of President BS buddies. Whoever leaked the story to PDI editors (who eventually assigned the writing to the brilliant and no-strings-attached Carvajal) sure had his own news management in mind and specific, laser-focused targets for the exposé.
On exhibit was how the erstwhile “heroes” of 1980s “people power” mythology — the supposedly “free” Philippine press, and certain yellow-shirted senators and congressmen — simply could not be trusted. Thus 2013 became the beginning of the end of the credibility of Big Corporate News Media in the Philippines.
In hindsight, we did not need Janet Lim Napoles to put the “scam” in the Great “PDAF Scam” of 2013. The Priority Development Assistance Fund had always been a scam. Filipinos were just too dumb to realise it over the last three decades. Indeed, the pork barrel, like the country’s jeepney infestation, are products of short-sighted populist politics. Both are products of wrong arguments that have been allowed to win for too long by a people not exactly renowned for arguing intelligently.
It does not take political “experts” to see that the whole point in being a duly-elected legislator is to ensure that constituencies are well-represented when crafting laws. They should leave the execution of those laws (and the use of public funds to do so) to the Executive Branch. That is why said branch is named as such.
Trying to “fix pork without hurting those who really need it” is like trying to modernise public transport without abolishing the jeepney. Change always hurts. Only people who lack imagination and routinely face the future with a pathetic lack of courage aspire for painless change. And so the question remains. Will the conviction of Janet Lim Napoles really make any difference in the bigger scheme of things? I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for the preferred answer to that question.",Politics
The Philippines is right not to join international condemnation of the Myanmar coup d’etat,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/the-philippines-is-right-not-to-join-international-condemnation-of-the-myanmar-coup-detat/,"Why should the Philippines join the international community to condemn the coup d’etat that ousted the “democratic” government of Myanmar and established military rule there? Leading the condemnation, after all, is none other than the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) which, need we remind ourselves, itself has been unfair in its treatment of the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Back in 2019, the UNHRC approved a resolution directing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to prepare a “comprehensive written report on the situation of human rights in the Philippines” within a year. This was nothing short of an insult to Filipino voters. The fact is, the Philippines remains a fully-functional democracy with a completely free (even rambunctious) press, fully independent co-equal branches of government that keep one another in check, and a dynamic free market economy. Seeing the way the UNHRC seems to arbitrarily judge how democratic — or undemocratic — a state is and get it wrong half the time highlights the presumptuosness in the manner with which it invites the international community to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
More importantly, it is evident that this whole Myanmar thing is, yet again, being used by the Philippine Opposition as another opportunity to undermine the government of their own country. Unfortunately for them, the way they go about it only further reveals their camp’s profound intellectual dishonesty. Case in point is this tweet issued by Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco.
That depends on what you mean by “we”, Mr Lasco. If by “we” you mean your lot, perhaps you should look no further than one of the leading politicians in your camp, the convicted putschist and former “senator” Antonio Trillanes, for a reality check. Trillanes remains a revered “thought leader” of the Philippine Opposition despite having led a mutiny in the mid 2000s that sought to do exactly what the Myanmar Army had succeeded at today. Trillanes was one of a number of Filipino ex-military personnel who mounted a rebellion against the government of then President Gloria Arroyo in 2003 and again in 2006. When Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III came to power in 2010, he issued Proclamation 50 granting amnesty to Trillanes allowing him to escape accountability for these crimes.
What exactly does Lasco mean when he asserts that the indifference with which the Philippine Government would regard the events transpiring in Myanmar is “not who we are”?
For that matter, what’s the big deal to begin with? The Philippines lacks any capability to project diplomatic, political, cultural, or military power beyond its shores. For all the shrill posturing of Opposition “thought” leaders like Gideon Lasco, there really is not much Filipinos can influence in Myanmar no matter how much he and his pals “stand in solidarity” with Myanmarians (is that what you call them?) protesting the demise of their “democracy”. There is much the Opposition need to focus on that is far more important than stuff happening in a little Indochinese country. Winning the 2022 elections comes to mind. Does the average Filipino voter really give a shit about Myanmar? The answer to that question may be the wake-up call the Philippine Opposition badly need to get their priorities right.",Politics
“Influencers” should lead the way in educating voters and not contribute to making them dumber,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/influencers-should-lead-the-way-in-educating-voters-and-not-contribute-to-making-them-dumber/,"Elections are just around the corner again and it will be interesting to see whether the campaigns that will be in full swing soon will be any different to the ones we beheld in previous elections. Will these campaigns appeal to intelligence? Or will, as tradition holds, these appeal to base emotions and shallow showbiz tastes?
To be fair, the goal in an election campaign — specially in the Philippines where the popular vote directly determines who gets to be head of government — is popularity and, therefore, what appeals to mass Filipino tastes wins. As such, it is likely that we will be seeing a lot of the same ocho-ocho politics and “activism” we’ve seen before — singing, dancing, “endorsements” from celebrities, and the candidates themselves engaged in all sorts of TikTok-styled stunts and buffoonery just to achieve the virality and clout that today’s social media politics demand.
Might I suggest, in the face of this stark reality of Philippine politics, that real influencers who seek to genuinely influence the Filipino vote in the right way step back from this tradition of idiocy and serve as examples for all the rest? Perhaps leave the emo and showbiz tactics to the traditional “activists” and politicians and to long-discredited “political bloggers” and be the beacon of critical thinking over this campaign period? That’s not too much to ask. There are a lot of serious issues to be highlighted and debated, bad behaviour in our politicians that demand intelligent scrutiny, and lots of traditional cultural dysfunction in our politics to be rooted out that we are better off focusing on.
Dancing and acting like divas on videos posted on Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok will not improve the Filipino voter’s ability to dissect these issues and engage in productive conversation to come up with solutions and ways forward. Traditional campaigns, idiotic influencing on social media, and dishonest persuasion methods will simply yield the same dysfunctional social and political outcomes. Suffice to say, people who genuinely want to see real social and economic progress in Philippine society exist in all partisan camps. Unfortunately they are out-gunned by a parasitical clique of Netizens who are only out for fame and digital clout and will not think twice about muddying the debate just to direct attention to their antics. These parasites will turn serious issues and topics of national consequence into circuses just for the clicks, retweets, likes, and shares. Meanwhile, Filipinos simply get dumber as they gleefully consume these digital opiates.
Influencers who have big followings should encourage their audience to think and not just to watch. This is what it really means to engage one’s community. Engaging means inviting one’s followers to conversation and is not just about putting up a showbiz performance that reduces them to mobs of fantards who passively consume instead of actively and intelligently participate.
As the old cliché goes, with great power comes great responsibility. What are you going to do with the great power that comes with your big audience? Make people smarter, make the issues clearer, and induce innovative thinking? Or turn them into fawning morons, starstruck beyond all recognition? We can choose to be real instruments of change and yet many choose to be mere entertainers who pretend to take important positions on important matters. It’s high time we choose what is right.",Politics
Leni Robredo’s preference for “local office” proves she is not a leader of NATIONS,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/leni-robredos-preference-for-local-office-proves-she-is-not-a-leader-of-nations/,"March is approaching and still no standout Opposition leader. The 2022 national elections are looming in the horizon and the only person being put forth as a “viable” challenger to the administration camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is “vice president” Leni Robredo — that is, for those who see the Liberal Party (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) as representative or even leaders of the broader Opposition. But is Robredo really up to the task?
This is the latest “report” on Robredo’s personal position on the matter of Opposition leadership.
“If I run for president, I need to be really ready — ready not only for the job but for the fight, and that’s where the problem is,”  she said in Filipino in an interview with GMA News in Naga City, Camarines Sur, when asked for a reaction to calls for her to run for the highest government post.
“As in all my other elections, I’m open to all possibilities. I’m okay with everything — with various positions,” she added.
Later on, she said that she would be much “happier” in local office where she would have “direct contact” with people.
“So very, very honestly, if I had a choice, I would prefer a local position,” she said.
From the above, it is easy to see why Robredo consistently fails to hit the mark on “leadership”.
For one thing, this most recent of Robredo’s ululations clearly exhibits the hollowness of her national leader rhetoric (or at least the script fed to her by her handlers). If she truly has a strong vision for the Philippines which she is presumably resolved to see through, why then is she expressing a preference for a local position? To be a leader of nations, one is expected to see nothing less than the top spot as a means to execute a strategy to achieve this vision. To change, reform, and make nations great, one needs to be a national leader. One cannot do any of that — certainly not the stuff expected of her by her own followers and supporters — if she apires to be no more than a town mayor.
“I am open to all possibilities” is such a lame cop-out. It is something said by a mere cork bobing on rough waters content to end up wherever the current takes it. That is not a leader. Leaders know what they want and know what it takes — the resources and steps required — to get it. Leaders take people for the ride and pull them along the journey they map out. Robredo is doing it the other way around. She is waiting for people to push her along and tell her what she does next. Robredo’s claim to national leadership is a dishonest one — because she clearly has no intention of leading.
Therefore, a political party that tries to drum up support — and funding — for a lame politician like Leni Robredo is, by association, a dishonest one. It is evident that all the Liberal Party really want out of Robredo is for her to open the door for the LP mafia to walk through. Robredo’s supporters cry “Let Leni Lead”. Ironic, because it seems there is no intent on the part of Robredo’s own party to let her lead.
What is laughable about the LP “strategy” to put up Robredo as their ticket to the 2022 race is that it has long been evident that she is not even winnable. The most recent popularity poll shows Robredo languishing at a 57 percent rating and she continues to trail way behind other strong politicians who rate in the mid to high 70s and 80s. What is the LP winning strategy then seeing that there is no way they will ever seize power legally again? Another “people power revolution”? Quite disturbing when one recalls how Senator and LP President Kiko Pangilinan routinely suggests that Filipinos break the law by ousting Duterte through “people power”. Coming from no less than a Philippine Senator, this sort of public incitement is nothing short of criminal.
It is increasingly clear that the broader Philippine Opposition is in deepening trouble as time runs out and their pitch to the Filipino people is nowhere near as compelling as it needs to be considering who and what they are up against. The stubborn loyalty to the LP and the losing proposition they put up to their lot — “vice president” Leni Robredo, who aspires to nothing more than a “local position” — is setting them up for catastrophic failure in 2022. Filipinos deserve a better and more intelligent Opposition than this.",Politics

Duterte’s killing it. And the only way we even have a chance of winning 2022 is if we go back to basics: understand the enemy, battle with propaganda, set aside difference, unite on common issues, and get our shit together.
…but simple as that may be in writing, it is difficult to put in practice when one considers the pompousness, arrogance, and stupidity of the the Opposition’s top “thought leaders”.
For starters, it would be difficult to understand the enemy if the Opposition’s top “influencers” would rather block and dismiss them. Indeed, Stuart-Santiago laments, “we’re still talking about what we like to dismiss to be nothing more than troll discourse, brought on by a few high-profile propagandists and spread by troll farms” — an unpopular opinion in a sea of clucking amigas who get their kicks bragging amongst themselves about the number of “trolls” that they have so far blocked or muted on Twitter. In such an environment, an article that makes audacious claims such as this gem of mine, “Leni Robredo is the source of all stupidity in the Philippines” is pretty much free to propagate across the Net unchallenged. To my standard call prove me wrong, all I get is crickets.
Interestingly enough, much as how Stuart-Santiago tries her darndest to swallow her pride and admit that her enemies are “killing it”, she remains guilty of the very thing that had done her lot in — dismissing without understanding. Throughout her piece, she works off the underlying assumption that all of the info and messaging coming from The Enemy are mere “lies” and “propaganda”. The fact is, and Stuart-Santiago herself wrote this, all of what they are up against and need to face like men lest they end up “delivering 2022 to Duterte-Marcos-GMA on a silver platter” is “multilayered and complex”. Simply assuming that it is all propaganda and lies is Stuart-Santiago contradicting her own regard for the challenge by oversimplifying her enemy’s arsenal.
Therein that too in regarding her “enemy” and their arsenal is another flawed assumption — that, in her own words, it is all part of some sort of “machinery” that, she suggests, is orchestrated and directed from the top-down by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Again, this is an oversimplification. Much of what constitutes this “machinery” are just ordinary people and agents acting on disparate, individual, and personal motivations. Perhaps the idea that an individualistic community could come together into a collective force that she describes as “well-strategized, hard-at-work, uncompromising, and unstoppable” is alien to minds like hers that are imprisoned by an ideology of extreme collectivism — Communism 101 right there.
The fact is, this “machinery” Stuart-Santiago sees today is an emergent manifestation of a true grassroots community united from the bottom-up not by the directives of any one politician or anointed “thought leader” from the Establishment but by a shared ethic of independent discourse. It only so happens that the hypocrisy, inconsistency, and self-righteousness of the two dominant blocs within the Opposition — the Yellowtards and the communists — have made it easy for this community to align their thinking against the intellectual disease propagated by these two blocs and create what is now perceived to be a “machine” by an Opposition that refuses to really understand what is going on in an intellectually honest manner.
It is because of these oversimplifications that Stuart-Santiago gets her call to action to “get [their] shit together” only half-right. She includes something that is quite revealing of the character of the Opposition today — perhaps the very reason they’ve been losing, will continue to lose, and will likely lose in 2022. Stuart-Santiago calls on her lot to “battle with propaganda” — basically continue living by the very intellectual dishonesty that had cost them an entire nation to begin with. Indeed, Yellowtardism and communism were all narratives propagated on the back of lies — the lie that the Aquinos and Cojuangcos own the 1986 EDSA Revolution and the lie that the communists hold the best interests of the nation foremost as they seek to overthrow legitimately-elected governments all over the world.
Nonetheless, Kat Stuart-Santiago is off to a good start — begin by understanding The Enemy. Only then can a plan to beat them at least make it to the drawing board. That said, perhaps applying a bit more intellectual honesty to their “cause” still remains an area for development for a camp that had long been accustomed with getting away with dishonesty.",Politics
Isn’t there anything else an Opposition can be other than “pro-democracy”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/isnt-there-anything-else-an-opposition-can-be-other-than-pro-democracy/,"What kind of Opposition do Filipinos need? Should it be a party or “coalition” that claims to be “pro-democracy” and — wait for it — “pro-people”? Perhaps. But, see, Filipinos have heard all that before. The inevitable question then follows: So what else is new?
What else is new?
Isn’t there anything else an Opposition can shriek about beyond being “anti-tyranny” and “for the people”. Isn’t there anything that “activists” can “fight” for other than the “oppression” they keep leading Filipinos to believe they are “victims” of?
Filipinos deserve better than this. They want to be shown a path forward and not be constantly nagged about what they should not be. The way forward should be toward an aspired for or envisioned state. Unfortunately all the Opposition can offer Filipinos today is a path away from a feared past. The tired old overused rhetoric of the Liberal Party for example is all about reminding us of “the Martial Law Years” and how anyone or anything they supposedly “dissent” against are part of an axis of “sinister forces” that conspire to drag Filipinos back to those “dark” years.
It’s all so old hat and comes across like an annoying broken record. The Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc — primarily members of the Liberal Party — rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) make as if the Philippines is not a democracy and that they alone could restore it. In asserting this, they do no more than insult the intelligence of Filipinos.
Try as the usual cast of characters might to rebrand their camp as a “genuine” or “unified” opposition, they will fail to win back the confidence of the Filipino people unless they can show some semblance of a vision. What is their vision of the Philippines in 2028 if given the chance to take the reigns of power from 2022? “Pro-democracy” or “pro-people” are not vision statements. They are mere platitudes — dishonest ones, in fact, coming from the crooked mouths of traditional politicians.
A modern and intelligent Opposition will possess the courage to table a bold vision for the nation, the foresight to chart a hard path to get there, and the charisma to take Filipinos on that journey down that path. While there are lots of lessons to learn from the past, Filipinos should quit defining themselves by a history written to suit one party’s dishonest political agenda. Progress can only be sustained when eyes are focused on the future — even an uncertain one. The government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys the trust of the Filipino people and if the Opposition want to win that trust back, they need to propose real alternatives, not merely raise old and irrelevant fears as had become their habit.",Politics
Yellowtards need to learn to KISS “DDS” ass if they are to stand a chance in 2022!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/yellowtards-need-to-learn-to-kiss-dds-ass-if-they-are-to-stand-a-chance-in-2022/,"The objective of an election campaign is to convert voters, last we recall. So one could reasonably expect an Opposition camp going up against the political brand of a popular incumbent like Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to apply an inclusive approach. Unfortunately there seems to be no evidence that the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) have learnt any lessons from the catastrophic electoral losses they have been suffering since 2016.
The fact is, the Yellowtards need the “Die-hard Duterte Supporters” (DDS) camp more than the DDS need them. So if I were the esteemed “thought leaders” of the Opposition, I’d be really thinking through my messaging strategies when launching campaign and PR initiatives as the powers-that-be start to get in gear for the coming race. The smarter amongst us would think that a key pillar of such messaging strategies is to get really friendly with the DDS camp and tone down rhetoric that seeks to belittle them. Of course the idealists amongst these “thought leaders” would balk at such an idea on account of what they will argue are the “principles” at stake.
And what are these “principles” these venerable Yellowtard sages hold dear?
We need not look too far for an answer. A recent attempt to put up an “independent” opposition coalition dubbed “1Sambayan”, according to a Philippine Star “report”, presumes to lay claim to the “pro-democracy” label. According to the leader of this movement, retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio…
There are Filipino leaders who can do a much better job of running the government, reviving the economy, creating jobs for our people, and defending our territory and sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea.
We in the 1Sambayan will search for these Filipino leaders, unite them into one national slate and present the Filipino people with a clear choice in the May 2022 national elections.
But, see, principles don’t win elections in the Philippines.
Almost as soon as this movement was launched, it had fallen flat on its face copping a torrent of laughs from casual observers of the Philippines’ comedic politics as well as from the very partisan camps this fledgling “coalition” sought to rope in. Top Yellowtard politician and presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo, while expressing flattery over being considered by 1Sambayan as a viable presidential bet, issued a mere non-committal “hope that [the independent process being conducted by 1Sambayan] will truly result in a greater degree of unity among democratic constituencies moving forward to 2022.” Ouch! So much for the who’s who of Yellowtardom gushing over the prospect of being anointed by the mighty 1Sambayan coalition.
Here is why 1Sambayan fails…
Fail Number One: The Star unilaterally bannered Carpio’s movement as a “pro-democracy” one on its headline. See, if you are going to be engaging the services of your Big Corporate Media connections, you really need to be on top of how they will be wording their stories. The Star suggests that Carpio’s coalition is presenting the “democratic” choice — as if asserting that the Duterte camp is undemocratic! That’s the sort of language that will likely evoke bemusement at best — a far cry from the awe an Opposition will need to inspire to win an election.
Fail Number Two: It relied on Yellowtard “influencers” to spread the news. For example, it would have been prudent for the PR consultants of 1Sambayan to think twice about associating their client with the likes of Pinoy Ako Blog personality Jover Laurio and Rapplerette Mara Cepeda in any sort of social media campaign.
Fail Number Three: The messaging focused on names and personalities and not on ideas and platforms. As is evident with that tweet issued by Cepeda, 1Sambayan kicked off with a list of names it presumptuously endorses as 2022 presientiables. The only outcome of this ill-thought-out approach was to create “debate” on whether or not these personalities were “anti-Duterte” enough to be considered “true” Opposition leaders.
As the famous saying goes, “small minds chatter about people, mediocre minds talk about events, great minds discuss ideas”.
This early failure in the opening weeks of the 2022 campaign already serves as an important lesson to the Philippine Opposition: don’t act like such pompous windbags. Find common ground with Filipino voters instead of being a force of polarisation. More importantly, ditch people like convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes and find alternative channels and platforms to engage with the ordinary Filipinos and not just the chi chi private school set that waste their eyeballs on dishonest “social news networks” like Rappler.
And, please, enough of those cringey “opening prayers” that gjve non-Christian Filipinos the impression that they are outsiders in their own country. The Roman Catholic Church is no longer the mighty kingmaker it once was. No politician needs to kiss Catholic ass anymore. What they do need to kiss is “DDS” ass — at least just enough of it to convert a critical mass of voters to put up a worthy “fight” come 2022.",Politics
The Philippine Opposition need to find a SMARTER way of using COVID-19 as an election-winning “issue”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/the-philippine-opposition-need-to-find-a-smarter-way-of-using-covid-19-as-an-election-winning-issue/,"Following the colossal collapse of their first opening campaign salvo, the ill-fated “1Sambayan” initiative, Filipinos are still holding their breath waiting for the Philippine Opposition’s next major brainwave. So far all we get is the usual noise — the same shrill whining over how the Philippines is coping with the 12-month-old COVID-19 pandemic. That “crisis” is now last year’s news. It’s become baked into the big cake that is most ordinary Filipinos’ wretched daily lives.
Indeed, in case the Opposition’s foremost “thought leaders” haven’t noticed yet, the COVID-19 pandemic has long been banalised. It takes its place amongst all the other historically-unsolved big problems that aren’t as newsworthy or as potent fodders for political grandstanding and mudslinging. It is on its way to becoming just another one of the poor’s problems that rich people can desensitise themselves to — just another “issue” they can externalise as they remain hunkered down in their chi chi fortified communities and enclaves.
13,000 COVID deaths you say? To put that in perspective, more than 10,000 died over just a week or two of Typhoon Haiyan’s visit in 2013 alone. None of the risks that expose possibly hundreds of thousands of Filipinos to death by typhoons and other natural calamities have been mitigated since then. This is not to mention the bigger number of Filipinos who succumb to preventable deaths — health issues and injuries that could be otherwise resolved by fast and competent emergency response times and adequate medical and health care infrastructure. There’s also all those accidents waiting to happen thanks to Philippine society’s renowned lack of regard for safety and preventive maintenance. Taken together across land, sea, and air transport and infrastructure, these will likely account for another ten thousand-odd lives at risk of preventable death.
The country’s health and emergency services, its maturity as far as safety awareness, the quality of its systems and engineering, and the state of military preparedness are not up to scratch and those things have never been cornerstones of any election campaign platform. In short they’ve long been problems stretching back in history through multiple Philippine governments. What then makes this incompetent response to COVID-19 any different from all the other astounding displays of incompetence when faced with emergencies and adversities exhibited by the Philippines’ state services and collective community responses over much of its history since being granted independence by the United States in 1946?
The short of it is that taken in the context of the full landscape of preventable deaths that Filipinos are exposed to because of traditions of incompetence that go back decades, the COVID-19 crisis contributes a mere rounding-off error.
Given all of the above realities, here is the important question: Is the Opposition’s monomanic focus on COVID-19 as the lynchpin for their campaign against the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte — and a cornerstone of their campaign for 2022 — good political strategy? Put it another way, do Filipinos really care about the way the Opposition presume to whine about all this on their behalf? If not, then the Opposition are well advised to come up with something better than COVID-19 Crybabyism to use as fodder for their political campaigns. See, the investment of time, energy, and capital the Opposition plow into making COVID-19 an election “issue” will likely not yield the only really important returns here — converted voters.
On the other hand, if Filipinos do care about the COVID-19 government response and see it as a key factor in who and what they decide to vote for in 2022, are the Opposition playing the COVID-19 Card right? Is whining (in the shrill manner we see today) about how Duterte handled the crisis enough to convert voters? Or is there a smarter way for the Opposition to make COVID-19 an election issue that works in their favour? The Opposition need to put pen to paper and fire up their fancy spreadsheets to really analyse the numbers. Suffice to say, popularity surveys conducted by reputable polling firms over the last 12 months already show that COVID-19 has not put a dent on the formidable political capital the Duterte camp enjoys to this day. The message should have been clear to the Opposition even as far back as mid-2020 and, still, they seem to have not learned anything.
Look at it from the ordinary Filipino’s point of view and ask, for example, whether the risk of death of not wearing a mask or face shield is as big as eating pagpag (food made from ingredients collected from garbage bins). Or if raising kids to live and beg at street corners everyday and breath Manila’s corrosive air is any worse than not keeping one’s distance from another while riding a jeepney. Or if that mound of rubbish in front of one’s doorstep that hasn’t been collected for days exudes pathogens that aren’t as deadly as any you’d be exposed to under this COVID-19 “crisis”.
Ordinary Filipinos make those little life-and-death decisions everyday. To face COVID-19 is just another one of those little life choices they face with stoic faces while the chi chi “thought leaders” of the Opposition tapping away on their iPads while they sip their lattes at the local Starbucks incite outrage fads on social media and mount shrill “activist” campaigns over. What Filipinos need are ways forward and pathways around these problems. Is the Opposition up to the challenge of getting their rhetoric up to that intellectual level? That remains to be seen — that is, if they can get over their traditional ways of using the old empty “pro-democracy”, “pro-people”, and “unity” as collateral for their dishonest platforms and do their part in contributing real substance to Philippine democracy.",Politics
The Philippine Opposition need a leader who is courageous enough to NOT HATE Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/the-philippine-opposition-need-a-leader-who-is-courageous-enough-to-not-hate-duterte/,"A “united opposition” is nice in theory but almost an impossibility in practice. What today’s Philippine Opposition are up against is the camp of an incumbent, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who remains enormously popular. This is in contrast to former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III whose personal “Aquino” brand and his party’s “yellow” narrative were but pale shadows of their former glory by the time the campaign for the 2016 elections began. Back then, even a divided Opposition — had Duterte not even run for president — would have made minced meat of his party.
The Opposition today think they could do a repeat of the campaign that crushed the Yellowtard brand and paved the way for change — a campaign that sustained a constant bombardment of the Aquino administration, and his Yellowtard minions, and their entire belief system day and night, seven days a week. Despite having one of the mightiest communications team of any Philippine government at his disposal — one that included the Noted One himself, the eminent Manuel L Quezon III — the Aquino administration withered under the relentless shelling. Despite being backed by no less than the Roman Catholic Church and its vassal network of exclusive private schools and their chi chi alumni “thought leaders”, the camp was no match for a loose informal community of newspaper columnists and bloggers who poked hooks into gaping cracks in the veneer of “decency” that was the Yellowtards’ campaign costume, twisted these in, and then pulled out stinking evidence of their inner rot.
It is evident that the Opposition are attempting the same strategy today — sustaining a demonisation campaign against Duterte, kicking up outrage fads over the most trivial birthday dinners, making every misfortune to befall the Philippines out to be his government’s fault, and spinning false correlations between economic trends and his administration. None of these lame copycat tactics have worked. Duterte’s popularity persists and his political capital is as formidable as it had been in 2016. Barring a catastrophe that could be convincingly linked to a major indiscretion or dereliction of duty on the part of the Duterte government, the Opposition need to re-think their approach if they are to put up a good fight in the lead up to the 2022 elections. Indeed, the Opposition style has long been revealed for what it truly is — one that is basically a five-year long prayer for a major national disaster that would sink the Duterte administration. Well they did get their prayers answered in 2020. But the disaster the Opposition prayed for that was COVID-19 did not deliver the blow to Duterte’s popularity they were hoping it would.
As such, it is high time the Opposition drop the Hate Duterte rhetoric. That’s easier said than done. At the moment, social media is saturated with pompous and self-righteous “thought leaders”, “influencers”, and celebrities scrambling to shore up their “personal brands” by attracting retweets and likes on the back of Hate Duterte collateral masquerading as “woke” rhetoric. Duterte is being painted as a “misogynist” and a “tyrant” among other things which is a convenient effigy for wokedom’s “feminist” and “human rights” sloganeering to be directed at.
The “woke” bandwagon is just too hard to resist (or get off from) for Netizens chasing clout. As such, the person tasked to lead the Philippine Opposition’s 2022 election campaign will have the unenviable task of reining in this chi chi community of chattering titas and amigas and implement a coherent communication strategy with a consistent and well-coordinated messaging apparatus as its main pillar. This leader will need the stature and charisma to both inspire and command the attention of this “woke” community that dominate the collective voice of the broader Opposition. He or she will have to ensure that any semblance of inclusiveness the Opposition exhibit is not undone by any reversion to or association with elitist Yellowtard and communist rhetoric such as disente triumphalism, Martial Law and COVID Crybabyism, “human rights” fashionista ululations, ocho-ocho “people power”, and demonisation of the Philippine military and police.
To be seen to be one working with all Filipinos and not against mythical bogeymen and abstract historical demons is key to the long-overdue rise of a strong, modern, and respectable Philippine Opposition. Filipinos need a capable and intelligent Opposition leader to turn today’s bratty rabble of sissies and whiners into a force of smart fighters who say, and write more than lame banalities that add rather than subtract from the Philippines’ collective intellect.
The 2022 election is just around the corner. Clock is ticking.",Politics
3 reasons why the communists and Yellowtards are to blame for everything going wrong in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/3-reasons-why-the-communists-and-yellowtards-are-to-blame-for-everything-going-wrong-in-the-philippines/,"No one will argue against the fact that the Philippines is in crisis today. But what is unnecessarily debatable is how the government should be responding to it. With a pandemic ravaging the Philippines, there are three things that are essential for a national government to be on top of: a strong military, a capability to track the movements of its citizens, and precise authoritative communications.
By their very nature, the Opposition — led by two ideologically-dishonest blocs — are undermining all these essential government measures. These two blocs, the Yellowtards (whose members are rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists, are ideologically inclined towards seizing power illegally by creating an environment of confusion and distrust — fertile ground for their so-called “people power” and “workers'” revolutions respectively. Because they operate these “revolutionary” networks, it is in their interests to see an incapable Philippine military, a weak state surveillance apparatus, and a confusing information dissemination landscape prevail.
Thus as follows are the true cornerstones of the Opposition agenda.
* * *
(1) Demonise the Philippine military and police establishments.
The Yellowtards and communists are ideologically-conditioned to demonise the Philippines’ state forces by painting them as the all-around bad guys in their “fight” for the Philippines’ “oppressed” people. For them the police and army are instruments of “fascism” and “state terror” and are not to be trusted. As such, the Yellowtards and communists, as a bloc, will oppose any investment in uplifting the capability of these services. The result of their relentless campaign against the military and police is the decades of neglect evident today.
(2) Create a general fear of government national identity management and surveillance measures.
The Yellowtards and communists will always see surveillance — even in the interests of the greater public and national security — as a threat to their networks of agents engaged in initiatives meant to destabilise and even terrorise Filipinos. As such, they strongly opposed the implementation of a national identification system and will continue to undermine its implementation. They will also mount fear mongering campaigns against any sort of technological solution to support contact tracing measures to collect data essential to manage the raging COVID-19 pandemic. For example, back in mid 2020, Opposition “social news network” Rappler bannered the sensational headline “borderline spyware” to describe the StaySafe app endorsed by the Philippines’ National Security Adviser Hermongenes Esperon Jr. The article used as reference “expert advise” from sources that were evidently cherry-picked to make statements that fit the preferred narrative of “reporter” Pia Ranada who wrote;
Despite StaySafe’s official designation, some members of the IT community and even a former ICT government official, worry about its data privacy measures. They also worry about how data gathered by the platform will be used by government – particularly the security agencies that have taken an interest in the app.
Fueling these concerns is the passage by Congress of the anti-terror bill, which law experts say, gives security officials dangerous powers, including prolonged and broadened surveillance.
All this takes place under the shadow of a deadly pandemic which United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said has given countries like the Philippines an excuse to crack down on legitimate dissent.
Note, specially, how Ranada uses as reference the words of a foreign “expert” on the Philippines’ internal affairs — as if it is only such Western insight into the goings-on within her country that enjoy enough gravitas to lend legitimacy to her “report”.
(3) Foment distrust of information outside of media channels the Opposition control.
Much of the shrillness surrounding fad notions of “disinformation” and “fake news” originate from the Yellowtards and communists — the earlier with their “fake news” fear mongering and the latter with their “red tagging” outrage fad. It is also quite convenient that the entire traditional mainstream media industry is reeling from the impact that mass access to social media has had on their big corporate bottom lines. As such, the Yellowtards and communists have found allies in the taipans that control the handful of enormous media conglomerates that, between themselves, virtually monopolise the Philippines’ mass information dissemination infrastructure. It is evident this monopoly is fast being eroded by alternative channels and they are fighting tooth and nail to protect their businesses.
* * *
In short, the Opposition offer nothing positive or forward looking and are campaigning on the back of a dishonest negative narrative — nothing more but to demonise, create fear, and embed distrust in Philippine society. That’s not a very constructive agenda and seeks to achieve the opposite, which is to destroy.
More importantly, these three focus areas are the building blocks of their crooked “activist” agendas. Firstly, the Opposition sustain a shrill awareness campaign of the Duterte administration’s “failure” to contain the external threat posed by China on the Philippines’ offshore interests in the South China Sea. Yet they would oppose any significant investment in the country’s military capabilities insisting, using their traditional “helping the poor” trope, to suggest where those funds could be “better spent”. Second, they harp about how the government fails to implement basic measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic like contact tracing yet would balk at any initiative that they could construe to be “state surveillance” in nature. Third, they would dismiss information disseminated outside of channels controlled by their cronies in Big Corporate Media as “fake news” but would carry on amongst themselves in their little chi chi echo chambers exchanging unsubstantiated factoids that they deem conveniently supportive of their preferred narratives. There are many other examples of the dishonest narratives the Yellowtards and communists craft using other permutations and combinations of these three key ingredients.
This is why the Opposition will fail to seize power legally in the coming years as long as they are  “led” by the Yellowtards and the communists. Their entire campaign platform is built on just three discredited pillars maintained by these two partisan blocs — demonise the military and police, monger fear over normal “state surveillance” most governments sustain in other countries, and call on people to distrust information channels outside of their circle of media cronies. The time has come to see through the false veneer of “decency” and “righteousness” these group use to mask their crooked ways. It’s time Filipinos put their foot down and put a stop to Yellowtard and communist criminal hypocrisy.",Politics
"Thank You, Celebrities!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/thank-you-celebrities/,"We have been seeing a barrage of tweets from the paragon of knowledge and virtue of our society lately – the celebrities of the entertainment world in the Philippines. Never mind the actual health experts, scientists, and reputable think-tanks. No! If it weren’t for the celebrities, mere mortals like us would not know that Filipinos are all victims of President Duterte’s “incompetence”. If it weren’t for the #DutertePalpak hashtags being spread by the tweets of some famous wokester actors, Filipinos may never have realized that the government’s job is to be all omnipotent and omniscient in dealing with Covid-19. So maybe it is time to thank our local celebrities for the patriotic service they are giving to our country.  We can always rely on them to make us realize that our lives suck under this present administration and that we are all hopeless against the pandemic because it’s really never about individual discipline and personal responsibility but it is always about the Duterte government’s failure.
Take actor Enchong Dee for instance. He tweets about what qualifies to be a magic wand and what qualifies to have a magic wand. I guess it must be true that simply being president makes one become a magic wand! I suppose that money solves anything and everything! Hey, Enchong asserts them so they must be true, right? No wonder why Enchong did not seem to see any problems during the Noynoy administration. Noynoy was president so he became the magic wand to wipe away any diplomatic embarrassment from the Luneta Massacre, the loss of the Scarborough Shoal, the daily gridlock from Metro Manila traffic, corruption highlighted by Pork Barrel and PDAF scandals, the massacre of the SAF44, and of course the death of thousands of our fellow Filipinos in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda. Filipinos also gave Noynoy all the people’s tax money during his reign. He had six years to use his magical powers as president! The fact that we hardly heard any whining from brilliant actors like Enchong back then probably makes his assertion true! Yes, being president with all the tax money at one’s disposal makes one able to magic away all of the country’s problems! Let’s thank, Enchong for making us realize that since Noynoy was able to do it, we should expect it from Duterte too! That was quite a brilliant thought from Dee! Now as for his demand for Duterte to stop using flowery words? Should he have just said “Kayo ang boss ko!”? Now from whom have I heard that before?
Then there’s the lovely Liza Soberano. She seems to have not only measured the lack of competence of the current dispensation, she also seems to suggest the government’s lack of compassion too! How? Well, Soberano compared the Philippines with America. America, she tweeted, has received two rounds of stimulus already and is just waiting on the third. In America, Covid testing is free, vaccination is free, I mean come on! If America can give so much freebies why can’t the Philippines have the same, right? Her heart surely bleeds for the poor in the Philippines as she seems to suggest that things will be a lot easier if everyone in the Philippines can have food on their table and money to pay the bills. Brilliant, right? Who do we suppose is responsible for feeding and giving money to everyone in the Philippines? Soberano seems to be alluding to the government. Yes! The Philippine government should always be the solution and the provider of all things just like how it is in America, as she seems to suggest. Never mind that despite being both fruits, an apple and an orange are not equivalent and never mind that Adolf Hitler and Jesus Christ are different individuals despite both having facial hair, the fact that a beautiful celebrity like Soberano tweets such an intelligent comparison between the Philippines and America ought to make all Filipinos realize that they should all be entitled to free stuff simply because America does it! Gee, how can Filipinos live without Soberano’s tweets of wisdom all the way from a relaxing vacation in Siargao?
Then of course, we have the grandmama and the grandpapa of all the celebrity geniuses – Ms. Leah Navarro and Mr. Jim Paredes.
Navarro presented her proof of Duterte’s incompetence by highlighting the country’s new cases of Covid-19. She seems to be arguing that since the Philippines has more than 7,000 new cases of Covid-19, Duterte is doing nothing and is killing Filipinos because of his negligence. She also seems to echo Enchong’s beef against the president with regards to the money the government was given to magic away the virus yet no magic has happened. Ms. Navarro is of course correct to point the shocking number of new Covid-19 cases. It certainly is a terrifying thought of catching the virus and infecting our loved ones at home. It is good that Filipinos have the one thing that gives Filipinos hope and strength to overcome this pandemic and it is none other than to listen to her song “Isang Mundo, Isang Awit”. Never mind that if we use Ms. Navarro’s logic, actual data will show that the world has far worse negligent killer leaders who deserve the #palpak hashtag, the singer of “Totoo Bang Lahat Ito” (move over Cardi B!) cannot possibly be using cherry-picked statistics merely to support an anti-Duterte agenda, right? A wise man (who incidentally, is colored yellow) once said:
“Oh, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that.”
Well, I guess when all things fail to convince more than 90 percent of mere mortals in the Philippines to turn against president Duterte, we can always rely on the genius of Mr. Jim Paredes to use his old anti-Marcos card. Sure, your business may be hurting, you may be days away from unemployment because of the economic effects of the pandemic and heck, your family may even be the next deadly statistic! These real problems don’t matter because Mr. Paredes asserts that Duterte is the new viral variant of bad boy Ferdinand Marcos and that is all that matters.

Elections are just around the corner and the Opposition are still PRAYING for Duterte’s death,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/elections-are-just-around-the-corner-and-the-opposition-are-still-praying-for-dutertes-death/,"Goes to show that there is no sincerity in the Opposition’s regard for the future of the Filipino people. Rather than work on something constructive in the lead up to the 2022 elections (like coming up with a forward-looking platform), they remain hopelessly fixated on taking lame potshots at Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Hey we get it, alright? Part of the effort to convert voters to your side is to paint the enemy under a bad light. But, see, that can’t be your only strategy. Having a single pillar to prop up a political strategy is setting yourself up for failure — because having a single point of failure enables your enemies to focus all their firepower on just that one point.
It is clearly evident that demonising Duterte and inciting rebellion against his government is no longer working. Yet the Opposition continue to do the same thing over and over again and, bizarrely, continue to expect different results. Worse, by continuing to whine about Duterte and about their miserable lives that, get this, is Duterte’s fault, Opposition “thought leaders” merely highlight just how vacuous their value proposition to the Filipino voter is. The Opposition, in essence, offer nothing other than a promise — yet again — that they are the “decent” alternative to Duterte (or any other parisan camp for that matter).
More disturbing is that the Roman Catholic Church are beginning to creep back into the picture. References to prayerfulness and retribution against “evil” are making their way back into the Opposition rhetoric. While these may appeal to the lot of superstitious Filipinos that have been the traditional voter base of the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan that presume to “lead” the Opposition), being in bed with the Church will only split the Opposition further. There are, after all, people who don’t subscribe to the Church’s non-negotiable hardline stand against homosexuals and transgenders, artificial contraception, abortion, gay marriage, and intellectual and sexual freedom among others. There seems to be no advantage in having the Church as a backer nowadays but pandering to religion and schmoozing with priests and cardinals are hard habits to break, indeed.
A space to watch is what a growing community of increasingly underemployed celebrities with lots of followers will be doing in the next several months. As unemployment bears down on the chi chi lifestyles of these social climbers, they increasingly become easy-pickins for conscription into one PR campaign or another. With Big Corporate Media and their top “talent” now more aware of the risks of being seen to be under the payroll of vote-hungry politicians, there will likely be less tolerance for celebrity political extravaganzas from both their fandom and their employers. The entertainment business, after all, is all about acquiring monolithic fandoms — not splintering them into fragments. On that regard, entertainers are on notice. Go woke, go broke.
The Opposition had still not learnt an important lesson since 2016. Playing “decent” is not an effective weapon against Duterte. In the lead up to the 2016 election, Duterte made thumbing his nose at all cultural conventions and social institutions — foremost among which is the Roman Catholic Church itself — a cornerstone of his campaign. This basically inoculated his persona against the Yellowtards’ Morality Police approach and appeal to Filipinos’ voodoo Catholic sensibilities. It therefore does not make sense to continue using an appeal to “decency” as the core of a campaign against the man. And yet here we are, still seeing the same obsolete approach being applied by the Opposition. Not smart, to say the least.
The clock is ticking and Philippine Opposition have yet to pick and sharpen their weapons. It is obvious that many in their arsenal have long fallen into obsolescence — appeals to “decency”, prayerfulness, showbiz PR, and parading around with an entourage of nuns no longer work. Calling for extra-constitutional “ousters” and waxing romantic “revolutionary” poetry are now brand-eroding no-nos. The Victim Card has been overused to tatters and “human rights”, “feminism”, and all that woke goodness have proven to be hopelessly abstract notions that don’t resonate outside of the chi chi halls of Catholic private schools and the communist tambayans of the University of the Philippines’ campuses.
The Opposition need to try harder and stop being such try hards. Filipino voters demand a modern and intelligent Opposition — not the pretentious prayerful lot we see today. People will relate to a forward-looking visionary proposal for better governance — not one that habitually harks to obsolete 1970s- and Cold-War-era bogeymen. Time to step up. The 2022 elections are looming in the horizon. Tick tock tick tock…",Politics
Community Pantry initiatives desperately being POLITICISED by Yellowtards and communists!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/community-pantry-initiatives-desperately-being-politicised-by-yellowtards-and-communists/,"Small stands and kiosks have been springing up all over Metro Manila offering various donated goods and food that anyone can pick up for free. The only condition is that people collect only what they need. These initiatives have become the buzz in both traditional and social media which helped spread the inspiration behind them.
Unfortunately, “activists” have descended upon these otherwise non-partisan projects and quickly framed them as “evidence” of the “failure” of the incumbent government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to manage the COVID-19 pandemic “competently”. One such “activist” is the “lawyer” Maria Sol Taule who, in a tweet, asserts that “initiatives of individuals to set up community pantries are reflections of government neglect.”
Trust partisans, “activists”, and “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition to throw political shades on otherwise genuine citizens’ initiatives to contribute to the community, right?
Community pantries are not a recent innovation and certainly not unique to the Philippines. They exist even in First World countries and have been around for a long time pre-COVID-19 pandemic. In the Philippine setting, the first such community pantry regarded in the context of the recent “second wave” infection surge in Metro Manila and the ensuing lockdown imposed following this was one organised by 26-year-old Ana Patricia Non reported by GMA News Online on the 14th April.
In an interview with GMA News Online, she said that she was both inspired and “agitated” by the current lockdown situation that the country is in due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“The unemployment rate is high, the line for relief goods is long, and Pinoys are hungry,” she said in Filipino. “We have been demanding a lot, but supplies are not enough. We really need to help each other. Community effort.”
Initiatives like these will always exist where there are people in need and the idea that they are done “in protest” of something is no more than the usual dishonest spin crooked “activists” guided by their monomamic political agendas routinely kick up around these. This habitual exploitation of authentic community activities has become the standard modus operandi of serial “activist” groups led by the Yellowtards (members of the leading bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists.
The manner with which these “activists” paint Filipinos as perennial hapless “victims” is an insult to people and communities who self-organise from the grassroots in efforts to become self reliant. Instead of framing such initiatives as ways to augment state services, these “activists” make them all about victimhood.
To the way “activists” are pointing out that community pantries are “evidence” that “socialism works”, many level-headed people are begging to disagree. One such dissenting person sums it up well, that these are just outcomes of “the generosity of the people who have excess to give away.”
Ordinary Filipinos should be given more credit and left alone by partisan interests whose rabid members presume to speak for them. Not everything is done for money and not everything is political. Perhaps the reason Filipinos are cynical about everything is because of groups like the Yellowtards and communists who always make everything all about politics. It’s time Filipinos dismiss these shills and focus on being independent thinkers — step up to be a people who are open to ideas and not mere obsolete ideology.",Politics
Petition for Duterte to “resign” proves just how LAZY the Philippine Opposition is!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/petition-for-duterte-to-resign-proves-just-how-lazy-the-philippine-opposition-is/,"A Change.ORG petition supposedly “signed by 500 medical frontliners, educators, youth leaders, religious, lawyers, civic leaders and concerned citizens” is currently making the rounds — shared and re-shared by no less than the top chi chi “thought leaders” and “influencers” of the Philippines’ wokedom. The petition given the title “Save the Nation! Duterte Resign!” asserts…
We deserve and demand better. Our country is on the brink of disaster. At the time the nation needs him most, Duterte is a total failure as a leader. He must step down.
We need a competent leadership that can finally ramp up free mass testing, expand contact tracing, and build the isolation and treatment facilities we so badly need towards strengthening the entire health care system.
Don’t we all, right?
But, see, in a democracy, leades are chosen through a process called elections. It so happens that there will be one such election on May 2022 — just 12 months away. The question is, what are the Opposition doing in the lead up to that election? You’d think they’d have some semblance of a campaign strategy by now or, at the very least, some candidates they’d be evaluating or testing for “winnability”. So far it seems that they have none of the above.
What they do have, however, is this idiotic petition. The question is, if even a million people “sign” the petition, the obvious question would then be, And then what?
Then again as of this writing, 18 hours after the petition was posted and even after a who’s who of Yellowtard (partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and communist “influencers” and “thought leaders” shared a link to it and enjoined all to support the petition, just 800 have signed. One wonders why these bozos keep doing this to themselves. It’s been proven already that consistently bagging thousands of retweets, shares, and “likes” on social media does not translate to converted real voters. An online petition is an even sketchier form of online “activism”. These stunts merely insult both Filipinos’ intelligence and their fledgling democracy.
What have the Opposition been doing all this time? What do they plan to do over the next 12 months?
If there is anyone who needs to be fired here for dereliction of duty it is the lot of the Philippine Opposition. The Opposition have one job — to pose a credible challenge to the incumbent. So far they have done nothing of the sort.
Filipinos deserve better than this lazy Opposition. They deserve an Opposition that strategises instead of sit around whining about an “enemy” who does not resign on their command. The real public demand here is on the Philippine Opposition — come up with an alternative to the Duterte Way, develop a platform that will serve as a foundation for an intelligent campaign, and present the people with a strategy to deliver on those campaign promises. The Opposition are called on to do their job and stop being such crybabies.",Politics
How to be happy in a time of COVID-19 lockdown,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/how-to-be-happy-in-a-time-of-covid-19-lockdown/,"The biggest challenge facing Filipinos nowadays is how to stay sane under a pandemic lockdown. Filipinos are suffering among the most severe restrictions to their movements in the world as well as facing the prospect of several more months of uncertainty around whether or not the spread of COVID-19 will be under control soon. Indeed, one of the biggest sources of worry is the lack of any sort of evidence that anyone of consequence is thinking these things through properly and, as such, people are not confident that their fortunes will change over the foreseeable future.
A traditional source of comfort for Filipinos is religion. This is likely because religion takes accountability over one’s future off one’s hands by deferring to the “mysterious ways” of a higher power. In this way one need to worry about whether one is doing enough or too little to fix things that make one unhappy or dissatisfied. Everything that happens is “God’s will” and, therefore, my happiness or suffering is through no fault of mine. And as to the question on why God does things or allows things to happen? We’ll, no need to worry about that either. God, after all, works in mysterious ways. It’s not for mere mortals to know why these things happen.
You’d think then that religion offers the perfect pathway to happiness. When the future is way beyond any one’s ability to influence and is all up to the “mysterious ways” of God, then why worry, right?
What then does that leave one to spend their energies on in life if no problems are worth worrying about on account of the Almighty having all future bases covered by the power of His “mysterious ways? After all, in life, we still can’t help being happy or sad. And being happy is way better than being sad, so happiness remains a worthwhile pursuit and sadness a condition to avoid. People have brains after all. Religious people will insist that these brains are “god given” and therefore should be put to good use “for His greater glory”.
We perhaps then rationalise a personal pursuit of happiness as being one underaken for that “greater glory”. To be happy for God’s greater glory is, if we are to pursue this line of thinking, a noble pursuit that gives meaning to that happiness we are then enjoined to pursue. God’s greater glory is therefore, what gives religious people’s lives meaning. To be happy under that context is what it’s all about.
Under that light, it should be easy for Filipinos to be happy even under a lockdown with no end in sight in the midst of a pandemic that they are helpless against. After all, at no time in history have Filipinos ever exhibited any foresight to prepare for even the garden-variety typhoons and earthquakes that hit their country every now and then. What more a once-in-a-generation pandemic, right? It seems Filipinos are perfectly happy just lying around waiting to swallow whatever Mother Nature dishes out to them despite being equipped with their “God-given” brains to think a bit further ahead than their next meal or the next episode of their favourite teleserye.
Happiness is therefore a choice. We all have the power to decide to remain in a poker round despite being dealt a bad hand. It is in recognising what part of what lies ahead we have influence over and focusing on influencing that part of it. The key to happiness, therefore, is to not be unhappy.

Epilogue
The 2022 elections are just around the corner. As of this writing, no evidence of an Opposition credible enough to put up a worthy challenge to the administration camp has emerged. Instead, we are seeing a shrill fragmented rabble focused on whining about what they claim was not done well enough to “manage” this pandemic. All that highlights is what the leaders of this Opposition — the bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan, a.k.a. the Yellowtards — did not do while they were in power and whether or not they have a plan to do what they think should be done given the chance to be in power again. Then again, it raises the question of what they are doing now to increase their chances of achieving even the latter at least. What part of what lies ahead can this Opposition do now?

Lack of a strong national identity makes for dog-eat-dog Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/lack-of-a-strong-national-identity-makes-for-dog-eat-dog-philippine-politics/,"For a political and social scientist, Professor Antonio Contreras surely is naive. But he can also be pragmatic when it comes to his own self-promotion. Borderline personality disorder? Maybe. In his Manila Times piece he rails against the “dirty politics” of these times…
Popular culture has reinforced the image of politics as devoid of virtue. From “Scandal” to “House of Cards” to “Game of Thrones,” what we see are representations of politics as a world full of ambitious and greedy men and women deploying the art of power to serve their interests as they indulge in revenge, backstabbing and betrayal. Alliances are no longer emanating from trust but from convenient realignments ruled by the principle that the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
But if there is one corrosive element that is now pervasive in politics, it is that of betrayal, where former allies become new enemies simply because of ambition. This is precisely dangerous because it violates the very foundation of a body politic, which is built on trust. Social contract subsists on trust. Political representation is founded on the idea of trust. This is why betrayal of public trust rises to the same level as a high crime that warrants impeachment.
History is replete with the stories of how empires came about. The Roman Catholic Church evolved out of the Holy Roman Empire. Religion was the excuse for hegemony. There was royalty and there was the masses. America was supposed to be the land of the free. But look at how divided it is now. These divisions have been there since the British came. Up to now, there has been no justice for the American Indians but black lives matter, Asian lives matter, Hispanic lives matter and so on and so forth.
Contreras has no love lost for populists and conservatives but embraces the leftist-liberal-militant progressives. They too have their own power base. It’s not like they’re pure as driven snow. Has Contreras been face-to-face with a veteran politician like say, Danding Cojuangco? I doubt it. The Professor is limited to academic and therefore theoretical constructs.
My theory is politicos without provenance like former President Ferdinand Marcos suffer from the psychological dysfunction of proving something to themselves or for themselves. Marcos was a brilliant student but he wasn’t beyond the pragmatism of politics. Look at how he risked it all by shooting Julio Nalundasan. What did he and Danding have in common? It might have been the fact that Danding saw how his branch of the family was marginalized by Doña Ysidra. That drove him to succeed and go past what his forebears achieved. It’s interesting to note that Danding never retired. Of the Cojuangco family’s branches, it’s only Danding and his cousin Ramon’s branches which still have both money and power. The Cory branch has lost both. Theirs was the favorite of Doña Ysidra.
If you think about it carefully, President Rodrigo Duterte’s generation is the last vestige of the established power blocs which ruled the country beginning in the 50s through the 70s. Most of the progenies of the powerful politicos then weren’t able to make the transition. Marcos is most successful because his two children have made it as far as the Senate. Juan Ponce Enrile ends with JPE. Ramon Mitra’s children have only made it as far as Congress. Doy Laurel has none. Ninoy Aquino produced his wife Cory and Noynoy. But Noynoy doesn’t have the gravitas to continue having a say. The same is true with Gerry Roxas. The greed for power and money is what has kept the Philippines from becoming as progressive as its Asian neighbors.
The average Pinoy doesn’t identify as Asian. Most political scientists like Contreras suffer from the same malaise. The culprit has always been the lack of a national identity. It is not about political ideology as the Professor claims when he puts it all on the shoulders of Niccolo Machiavelli, writing;
If there is any irony, Machiavelli may have provided us a weapon. We the masses just have to keep fighting the corrupt political “nobility,” even as we yearn for a leader who will check their power and fight for us.
Contreras will never admit it but it was Duterte who broke the political template. He has gone beyond party politics. He doesn’t draw most of his support from oligarchs but from the people. Maybe this is why the National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose stated that Duterte could be recognized by history as one of the greatest, if not the greatest President ever, in the history of the country. This is why I believe that the 2022 election will not only be transformational but also cathartical.",Politics
China is the “bad guy” whether it is about tobacco or the virus,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/china-is-the-bad-guy-whether-it-is-about-tobacco-or-the-virus/,"Sinophobia and tobacco. Mareng Winnie throws everything at China. In her Inquirer column today “A victory for tobacco, a defeat for our children”, Monsod writes…
Wasn’t China the source of the virus in the first place? Not only that, didn’t China try to cover up its virus situation in the second place?
The virus, indeed, came from them. The vaccine donations not donations but reparations. Even if there is no corroborative evidence that China deliberately created COVID-19 as a biological weapon. After all, this is what the US would like humankind to believe. They are now delving deeper into the origin of the virus.
Monsod goes to the extent of questioning Chinese vaccine efficacy even if it has been proven in real world conditions. All of this malingering sinophobia is geared towards keeping the Filipinos and the Philippines leaning toward the US. Never mind if it has treated both very shoddily since the archipelago was a colony after its purchase in 1898. Pax Sinica is what the Americans fear the most. The Chinese have never shown a penchant for hegemony outside of its borders, except Tibet. We must remember what suffering the country and its people went through during World War II. At this point, the Philippines has to do a balancing act as it is squarely in the middle of any potential conflict between the two powers.
As far as tobacco is concerned, leave it up to our esteemed lawmakers to flip. Nicotine delivery systems they’re now called.
Because the bill overturns some of the hard-fought reforms that protected minors from the deadly results of tobaccoʍe-cigs and vaping are just new ways to get tobacco into them. The most egregious is the lowering of the minimum age for access to e-cigarettes to 18, and allowing the products to be sold and advertised online.
Evidence had been presented to the legislators showing the harmful, deadly effects of e-cigs. But this was all ignored. A victory for tobacco. A deadly defeat for our children.
Monsod will start hitting at China pretty soon on this issue because the world’s factory is the cheapest producer of the same. Vape is a trend among the younger demographic. It’s a fad similar to the height of smoking in the 50s and 60s when it was alright to smoke even on TV talk shows or while performing. Think Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin with their ubiquitous cigarettes.
The government has taxed the max out of the traditional delivery system which has smokers turning to vaping as a cheaper alternative and a more impactful nicotine fix. But it’s an election cycle and our lawmakers need campaign funds specially since the virus has made it compulsory that the campaign goes digital.
Individuals should be allowed to choose their poison if you ask me. The debate about alcohol and tobacco is as old as humankind. On the plus side, a French study has proven that smoker’s are less likely to get infected by COVID-19. It has something to do about mucous membranes being active as opposed to non-smokers. Smoking, drinking and politics are all addictive. Choose your poison well.",Politics
Cory Aquino and the dumbing down of Philippine Media the root cause of decline in quality of Filipino legislators,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/cory-aquino-and-the-dumbing-down-of-philippine-media-the-root-cause-of-decline-in-quality-of-filipino-legislators/,"Harry Roque’s law partner Joel Ruiz Butuyan complains about the quality of Senators but doesn’t put the finer on who should be blamed. Butuyan writes in his Inquirer column “Comparing past and present senators” today of “the faces of senators of the past renowned for their brilliance, juxtaposed with pictures of senators of the present who are regularly ridiculed.”
But, see, that’s actually on the leaders who tolerated the culture of mediocrity. Prior to the 1986 “revolution” that toppled the government of President Ferdinand Marcos, how many actors won elective office? Only one if my memory serves me right, Joseph Estrada. Rogelio De La Rosa ran but withdrew from the race. Actors confined themselves to local government unit (LGU) races for Councilor.
It was the Cory Aquino administration which opened the floodgates to actors switching over to politics. This was made possible by the TV networks which switched over to totally gross programming standards. Pilipino became the norm. The nightly newscast and FM radio stations weren’t spared. Even the anchors themselves became celebrities in their own right which saw the election of Noli De Castro to the Senate and Ted Failon to Congress.
Butuyan writes…
According to people’s reminiscences of politics before the Marcos dictatorship began in 1972, politicians of those years captivated the masses with their eloquent speeches, and crowds trooped to election rallies to be enthralled by the oratorical brilliance of their leaders. Our parents and grandparents chose their leaders based on superior intelligence, sterling track record, impressive academic credentials, and unblemished reputation.
What Butuyan will not admit is standards were lowered post-Marcos. The bastardization of institutions went into high-gear. Post-graduate degrees were for sale. This is why government bureaucracy is in a sorry state as well. Appointees and career officials may meet the qualifying standards but don’t have either or both the competence and the experience. Sadly even the better educated on paper are also lackluster. Just look at Drilon and De Lima. The Vice-President takes the cake. She doesn’t articulate like a lawyer. You can’t make much out of her statements because they’re basically word salads in a mix of English and Pilipino.
The main culprit is the freewheeling liberal-leftist democracy we have. There is no emphasis on discipline and high standards for government service. Government has actually become the dumping ground of the mediocre. Contrast this with Singapore where potential leaders are subject to rigorous training in terms of educational background and experience. The Senators of today hire intelligent staff members to do their thinking and write speeches for them. Diligence is also sorely lacking. In place of this is complete staff work but this is dependent on the quality of the staff they hire. Good talent is also a rarity these days. What makes it worst is hiring is also not based on qualifications but connections and loyalty to the principal.
This is why we have barely competent elected and appointed officials occupying government posts. If we want the country to become respected then we should put in the hard work of reforms in the socio-political and economic aspects of society. Otherwise we will continue our descent into becoming a nation of morons.",Politics
Doubtfully Legal Takeover of Dampa sa Greenhills,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/doubtfully-legal-takeover-of-dampa-sa-greenhills/,"Over the course of the past two years, I’ve become somewhat of a regular customer of Dampa sa Greenhills, an Ilonggo restaurant and bar just across the corner of Col. Bonny Serrano and Jose Abad Stantos Street in San Juan City, Metro Manila.
It’s an airy, sunlit place where the food is good and the drinks are as hot or as cold as you want it.
Pre-Covid19, friends from all over and I would gather there to talk over seafood, pizza, and crispy pata along with copious amounts of beer, wine or whisky. There’s usually entertainment in the early evenings and if you wanted to, you could also take the mic over to belt out your favorite songs — if you don’t mind waiting in-line.
Over the course going to that place, I’ve become friends with the owner/operator, a beautiful woman whom I fondly call Doc Marichi.
I can’t think of another restauranteur acquaintance who actually knows almost all of her clients and would drop by your table just to see if everyone is happy with the service.
Doc Marichi is undeniably the heart and soul of Dampa Sa Greenhills, the main draw and attraction that has people from, literally, all over over the country regularly visiting her place.  So much so, that if she ever decided to abandon Dampa Sa Greenhills, it would cease to be the a go-to place in San Juan City and a landmark by which people in the area navigate their daily affairs.
During the succession of various levels of lockdowns, Dampa sa Greenhills took a beating along with other businesses that rely on foot traffic (the actual presence of customers).
For sure, being a well seasoned businesswoman, Dra. Marichi could have just closed Dampa sa Greenhills and focused on her other businesses.  But she didn’t.
She kept her staff paid through the time when her restaurant couldn’t operate — even sacrificing or selling off assets to keep everyone fed and the business afloat.
Somehow, she managed to keep up to date with her place’s rent and for any business establishment these days, that is a mean feat. By the records of her transactions, Doc Marichi is an honest tenant who diligently paid rent when it was due, something that any lessor should value.
However, it doesn’t seem that her lessors appreciate this. Because, just this weekend, it seems their douchery peaked to a new level.
In the wee hours of Saturday morning, a hundred or so men attempted to “padlock” or barricade Dampa Sa Greenhills. Even its power was cut, possibly spoiling some of the food, and to boot, someone from the people that stormed the place gutted the restaurant’s CCTV system.
Doc Marichi’s staff who arrived when the place was being barricaded asked the men if they had a court order or any document permitting them to shutdown of Dampa. The men there said they didn’t know of a court order.
A printed tarp hung on the steel barricade informed whoever read it that “THIS PROPERTY IS PADLOCKED BY THE OWNER DYNAMICGLOBAL MULTIRESOURCE INC…” and justified the “padlocking” by citing Section 16 of what I assume to be the Contract of Lease.
Thing is, I’ve had experience leasing property and there’s a process that one must adhere to when evicting a lessee — which I surmise is the intent behind the so called padlocking or the next step to the padlocking of Dampa.
A resource page on Lamudi (a real estate company website) outlines the process for eviction and from what I gathered from Doc Marichi, it doesn’t seem like DYNAMICGLOBAL MULTIRESOURCE complied with the process.
To wit, the Lamudi website says:
Observance of a three-day notice
The tenant must be given notice three days prior to eviction. Needless to say, it is illegal to forcibly evict a tenant without ample notice, as well as changing the locks without the tenant’s consent. If the non-eviction is on the grounds of non-payment, the issue shall be deemed resolved should the tenant decides to pay the rent. However, if the tenant refuses to fulfill his or her financial obligations, the landlord can sue the tenant and the issue will be resolved in court. This can be taxing financially and time-consuming for both parties.
Eviction is a process that will take time
Evictions do not happen in an instant. According to the Tenant Eviction Law in the Philippines, the landlord has the right to sue the tenant after three consecutive months of non-payment but must wait for the tenant’s response to a writ supplied by the court indicating abandonment. The police will execute the eviction under court order.
Doc Marichi and I didn’t have a chance to talk lengthily about how she felt when Dampa was barricaded without a court order. But I could see she was emotionally distressed just as I imagine she would be if her home had been invaded.
Definitely a traumatising experience that Doc Marichi doesn’t deserve as a lessee and as a human being.
As a businesswoman in the City of San Juan, she deserves to be protected especially at a time when a large number of businesses in the area are floundering from all sorts of pandemic borne restrictions.
What happened to her certainly doesn’t look good on Mayor Francis Zamora.
Certainly, if one of Doc Marichi’s means can get treated like a rag by some landlord, what more of the other people with lesser means renting places in San Juan? Is THIS the kind of governance people in San Juan deserve?
The reason I mention this is because prior to the barricading of Dampa sa Greenhills, San Juan City’s BPLO issued a Cease and Desist Order against Doc Marichi’s restaurant to only later take it back after they were made aware of how baseless the order was and that it could open them up to an administrative complaint.
Talk is that somehow, Mayor Zamora’s BPLO was talked into (presumably) by the owners of DynamicGlobal to issue the baseless CDO. This they attributed to the close ties that the owners of DynamicGlobal had with Mayor Zamora.
But of course, that’s just talk, isn’t it?
What isn’t just talk, however, is the fact that people from the Mayor’s office DID come to Dampa to shut it own for apparently no good reason. Which is, by the looks of it, an earlier part of a progression towards this dubiously legal padlocking.",Politics
News of a meeting between Inday Sara Duterte and Bongbong Marcos has chilling effect on Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/news-of-a-meeting-between-inday-sara-duterte-and-bongbong-marcos-has-chilling-effect-on-opposition/,"Talk of a “meeting” between Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte and former Senator and 2016 vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is raging across social media. This follows a tweet issued by a media organisation known as SMNI News Channel.
According to SMNI News as indicated in the above tweet, the meeting occurred Sunday, the 30th May. The “news” it seems is based on just the photo attached to the tweet and not much else and, according to that same tweet, this news was “confirmed” by a “source” of SMNI News.
As of this writing, no other media outlet offers any information or reports corroborating any of this. However, “national political operator” Franco Cruz Mabanta, in a tweet issued shortly after, offered a “small correction” to the SMNI “report” claiming that the meeting between Duterte and Marcos “didn’t happen” on that date. Mabanta has so far not provided any further information on the matter. It so happens too that the 30th May is Ms Duterte’s birthday.
Supporters of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte regard the supposed meeting as a strong indication that Ms Duterte and Marcos will run as a tandem in the 2022 national elections and, in doing so, supposedly doom any Opposition bid for the highest and second highest offices of the Philippine Government. The apparent basis for this prognosis are Ms Duterte and Marcos topping a survey conducted by respected polling firm Pulse Asia, the results of which were issued January this year.
The Pulse Asia survey results showed top Opposition bet and current “vice president” Leni Robredo placing a dismal sixth behind Senator Grace Poe, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, and boxing-champ-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes who, some weeks ago, launched a coup against Robredo for the role of leader of top Opposition coalition 1Sambayan was not among the top “presidentiables” yielded by the survey or may not have been a choice offered to survey respondents at the time.
1Sambayan had this week set a deadline for itself committing to June 12 as the date for the release of its list of candidates for the coming elections. Following that, Robredo asserted in an interview with “journalist” Barnaby Lo on Viewpoint that she, or “someone else” should be the single Opposition presidential candidate as long as only one person runs. This, Robredo said in the the interview, is critical to ensure that the next six years after 2022 will “not be the same”. Robredo is clearly hinting that if the Opposition do not unite and ends up fielding multiple candidates, it will all but assure victory for the camp of President Duterte in 2022.
As of this writing, the Opposition has been seemingly generally quiet on any matter to do with the 2022 elections and the 1Sambayan Twitter account has not posted any new tweets in the last three days.
For now, given the sketchy information surrounding this matter, one can only turn to the timeless advise of Filipinos’ self-styled media “servant”, ABS-CBN: Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Politics
"United or divided, the Opposition will lose in 2022 — unless they get back to basics and learn how to WIN an election",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/united-or-divided-the-opposition-will-lose-in-2022-unless-they-get-back-to-basics-and-learn-how-to-win-an-election/,"I hate Mondays. This what beloved 1980s comic strip character Garfield declared. The first half of 2021 is about to end. It will be June by Wednesday and the last half of the year begins. 2021 is our first full year in the pandemic environment. It’s also an election year. The jockeying should’ve begun in January but was delayed by the pandemic. No politico would dare be political in a time of crisis. That’s political suicide. Yesterday, photos of Inday Sara with the Marcos’ surfaced. It was her birthday and the Marcos siblings paid their respects personally. The opposition’s socmed machinery had no response. Whether they were in shock or in denial couldn’t be fathomed. They’re getting ready for another event on June 3. Wakasan. What that means is only known to them.
Boo Chanco’s PhilSTAR piece today “The trolls have it” is mixed. You can’t ascertain if he’s throwing in the towel or giving the opposition pointers. Chanco labels the DDS (“Die-hard Duterte Supporters”) as trolls. Not all of them are. Most are genuine supporters of Duterte. Many of them are OFWs. The trolls are actually the bloggers or as some refer to them bloogers. They’re the mercenaries who claim to be for the country but are just minding their own pockets. They don’t have much influence on voter preference because the latter have made up their minds.
Nevertheless, in Chanco’s mind, it’s all a bit too simple…
The DDS or the Duterte Diehard Supporters (DDS) is a formidable social media army. And they keep the lights burning for Rodrigo Duterte.
That explains why Duterte’s ratings remain high even when the performance of his administration tumbles. The DDS shields him from any fallout. They are focused on protecting the Duterte brand.
The DDS messaging is kept simple. They attack the opposition through smear campaigns; distract or divert criticism away from important public issues; and suppress commentaries through personal attacks or harassment.
The result is a Teflon-coated Duterte. People may be dissatisfied with the administration’s handling of national problems as revealed by opinion polls but it hardly dents Duterte’s approval rating.
The emerging reality is that it’s Inday Sara Duterte or Bongbong Marcos either on top or as number two. As far as the Opposition goes, their sorry state is pathetic to say the least. It’s actually much worse because they’re only looking at Vice President Leni Robredo and former Senator and convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes as standard-bearers. No way Senator Grace Poe or Manila Mayor Isko Moreno will submit themselves to the selection process of primary Opposition coalition 1Sambayan. But even with the two, the Opposition still isn’t united. There are those who insist that it should be Robredo by default. Leni is up to her old tricks again by playing coy. In truth, she believes she should be the default candidate even if her chances of winning are weak. Trillanes barely rates among the public as Presidential material. He’s the only one who thinks he’s capable. He’s that desperate because he now even has a TikTok account.
Chanco missed out on the solid piece of advice needed by the opposition; a credible and coherent alternative platform of government. Enough with the childish memes about President Rodrigo Duterte. Insults and vilification do nothing for their cause. It actually turns off voters. They should be less elitist also. They claim to be part of the majority but have a natural disdain for the masa whom they refer to as bobotantes. Even Jover Laurio is beginning to sound elitist. But if an Inday-BBM tandem is in the works, the Opposition should just prepare for the Senatorial and local races. It’s actually an exercise in futility to put up a ticket against such a formidable opponent.
The President has begun reigning in recalcitrants in the PDP-Laban. He ordered party Vice-Chair Alfonso Cusi to call for a national assembly. This is to put Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao, Senator Koko Pimentel and his mutant turtle Ron Munsayac in their proper places. Duterte is still the titular head of PDP-Laban. We must not forget former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) is supposed to be a member as well even if she also has de facto control of the National Unity Party and Lakas-CMD. It remains to be seen if Isko will run as a third candidate. This is all up to the opposition oligarchs led by Manny Pangilinan (MVP) along with the Ayala and Lopez families. The question is, which political party will serve as their vehicle? In a previous piece, I explained how Duterte broke the political template of party machinery. This was the old normal. In a campaign that will rely more on digital platforms because of the pandemic, the party machinery will only be essential on election day to get the vote out and guard against fraud.
Chanco got this part right, and the Opposition should take heed…
Finally, no more Otso Diretso self-righteousness. Focus on winning the election. Fight fire with fire on social media. But find a winnable candidate first. Or prepare for a political dynasty’s national coronation.
The 2022 election is for the administration to lose and for the opposition to miraculously win without the intervention of SmartMagic.",Politics
Warning: Manny Pacquiao COULD beat Inday Sara Duterte in 2022!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/warning-manny-pacquiao-could-beat-inday-sara-duterte-in-2022/,"With boxing-champ-turned-Senator Manny Pacquiao now getting more aggressive in his bid for the Philippine Government’s top job in 2022, the political landscape gets more fluid. The administration camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and its bid for continuity beyond 2022 in fielding Inday Sara “Daughterte” is at stake despite Pacquiao being a member — and an officer — of ruling party PDP-Laban.
The Duterte camp need to be careful lest they make the same mistake the Yellowtards (the leading bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) made in 2016 and 2019 when they all but underestimated the power of the “populist” vote. Long regarded as the “populist” president, Duterte now stands at risk of having that label stripped off his political brand with Pacquiao very likely out-populisting the national Tatay. Pacquiao, after all, makes a strong value proposition being the Ninong ng Bayan. Most Filipinos would have grown up in a household where the Tatay and Nanay try to balance the household budget and rely on the Ninongs and Ninangs to indulge the kids’ appetite for nice things outside of that budget. As such, they’d catch that drift.
Not surprising is how a lot of “blogging” and “media” operations are being reactivated or are coming back from the dead now that a cast of characters performing in the coming circus that will be in town over the next 12 months leading to May 2022 is emerging. Many of these “media” operators will likely be providing the audience their bit of “insight” on the emerging campaign. The risk here is that the tendency of these competing media jobs will be to frame narratives around their respective favoured candidates (or worse, candidates sponsoring their operations).
In such a landscape, it is all too easy to lose sight of the big picture from an objective outsider’s perspective. When various operators see the landscape from their respective patrons’ lenses (to a hammer, everything looks like a nail), signals will emerge broadcasting outside of the spectrum or bandwidth these various lenses were designed to capture. This is pretty much how, back in 2016, Duterte all but blindsided the Yellowtards and their henchwomen operators in Big Corporate Media organisations like ABS-CBN, Rappler, and the Inquirer. He “came out of nowhere” because Imperial Manila, until then, regarded Mindanao as Nowhere Land. They had narrow-angle lenses focused on their chi chi circles and, worse, on the politics of their Republic of Twitter.
Until now, the battle for 2022 had been regarded as an emerging fight between “Daughterte” and whatever schmoe will be put up by Yellowtard-rebranded bloc 1Sambayan. The only other significantly winnable personality in Philippine politics is Pacquiao. Thus, it is really a three-way battle emerging — the Duterte clan, Pacquiao, and the still-to-be-decided Yellowtard Whoever (supposedly to be announced in June 12). Seeing the on-going turmoil within Duterte’s PDP-Laban election winning machine, a separate Pacquiao bloc may just happen.
Opposition “thought leaders” are already expecting the Duterte social media machine to turn against Pacquiao if that happens to ensure that the Duterte camp and its fandom remain solid in its bid for 2022. Let’s be specific here — we are already seeing RJ “Thinking Pinoy” Nieto and his former chum Sass Rogando Sasot cranking it up again after a period over which they were mysteriously dormant. There will also likely be other “media” operators coming back out casting their fishing hooks into the muck to angle for politicians swimming around with their mouths agape hungry for broadcast, print, and social media mileage. If they are out to grab a piece of the comms budgets of these various camps, they will have to consider Pacquiao as a third motherlode of “consulting” fees, right?
For now, the cards are stacked against Pacquiao in terms of a much-needed electioneering machine (seeing that PDP-Laban will likely be a no-go for him) and his coming into the comms and PR game relatively late. The parallels with the situation in 2016 abound. Consider too that, though Duterte’s popularity remains formidable, he has six years of debatable governance quality behind him that contributes some degree of risk to his campaign. Pacquiao, on the other hand, comes into the picture relatively clean as a whistle, enjoys a powerful personal brand, and offers a simple ultra-conservative pitch owing a lot to his comparatively unquestioned devotion to God — something that still resonates with the Filipino masses, despite years of woke liberal anti-religion propaganda espousing tolerance for “diverse” lifestyles and life choices.
The potential Pacquiao pitch can be summarised thus: Filipinos need to get back to basics: God, country, and family. Pacquiao’s personal brand is unsullied across all three. He is one of the few (if not the only) true Filipino conservative(s) and a branded fighter who could, if he wanted to, send willing Filipino boys out to the South China Sea to fight China to the death and to the last ship. Duterte, though a populist, is not a conservative. He had, over his six year term, insulted the religious establishment, continued the dithering on the South China Sea started by his predecessors, and not presented himself as a paragon of old-fashioned family virtue. PR, branding, and comms professionals should consider that ordinary Filipinos many of whom live in the real world not covered by the Republic of Twitter may actually be missing those good old-fashioned and simple values that Pacquiao’s personal brand embodies. He is to be discounted only at great risk, so best to beware. The road to 2022 may not be as straight as traditional “influencers” will have us believe.",Politics
What to expect from the South China Sea debate between President Duterte and former SC Justice Carpio,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/what-to-expect-from-the-south-china-sea-debate-between-president-duterte-and-former-sc-justice-carpio/,"Just as soon as I hit the “Publish” button on my previous piece “The LIAR Justice Carpio should accept President Duterte’s challenge to a debate”, news that Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio had accepted Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s challenge to a debate was out and sending Yellowtardom into a frenzy of shrill battle screeching. Shortly following that, the Philippine Bar Association (PBA) chimed in reportedly offering to host the debate. PBA president Rico Domingo, in offering the services of his organisation, promised to “provide a balanced arena fit for two lawyers of eminent stature and experience to dispassionately discuss the core issues relating to the dispute on the West Philippine Sea”.
In his acceptance message, Carpio called on Duterte to resign “now” and included a sworn statement on the matter of the Philippines’ naval pullout from the Scarborough standoff in 2012…
I state under oath that I was never involved in the decision to withdraw Philippine Navy ships from the West Philippine Sea during the 2012 Scarborough standoff…
It seems, Carpio would like to frame this debate within narrow terms favourable to him personally — that he was not involved in the 2012 Scarborough Shoal imbroglio that left the Philippines holding the short end of the stick. If that is all he is after, then he is being the dishonest man he had long been called out to be. In essence, Carpio, in his acceptance statement, has thrown his partner-in-crime former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario under the proverbial bus. If Carpio comes out of this debate with his name washed off the Scarborough fiasco, that leaves the question of del Rosario’s incompetence in the handling of that row still up for scrutiny and judgement.
Manila Times columnist and former ambassador Bobi Tiglao in his piece “Del Rosario lost Panatag to China” points out that “del Rosario ordered our vessels to leave the shoal, according to a written aide memoire by then senator Antonio Trillanes 4th, who was appointed by [then President Noynoy] Aquino to be his backchannel negotiator to the Chinese and an eyewitness as it were to the events.” Tiglao goes on to cite the disastrous result of del Rosario’s daft actions.
The Chinese didn’t leave the lagoon and subsequently blocked our ships from returning. The Philippines lost Scarborough — forever, as it were since there’s no chance in the world the Chinese would be persuaded to return it to us.
Perhaps del Rosario heard what he just wanted to hear — the Chinese had agreed to leave — as the mess was the consequence of the belligerent position, he advised Aquino to adopt. He and Aquino were desperate as the US had refused to intervene in the stand-off.
Del Rosario trusted the Americans so much, claiming he was told by US Assistant State Secretary Kurt Campbell, relayed through our ambassador in Washington, Jose Cuisia, the Chinese had agreed to a simultaneous withdrawal.
The issue of the dispute between the Philippines and China over South China Sea territories is bigger than Carpio and his pompous legal jargon. Thus the occasion of this debate should not be all about him alone. Indeed, as big as this issue are the lies of a Philippine “win” in the South China Sea dispute that the Carpio-Del Rosario “tandem”, as Tiglao puts it, have been propagating.
Duterte does not have to respond to Carpio’s acceptance of his debate challenge in the terms that Carpio tabled. Rather, the President should propose a broader frame to this debate and use this event to settle on national television once and for all — at least via a categorical statement of position from Carpio — the following questions:
(1) Who really ordered the Philippine pullout from Scarborough Shoal in 2012? The culprit is seen to be del Rosario but ultimate responsibility falls upon the shoulders of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III under whose watch this disaster unfolded. To him reported the other characters who contributed to this imbroglio — then Ambassador to the United States Jose Cuisia and his China backchannel agent convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes.
(2) Was the Philippines’ ability to execute and enforce the “arbitral award” ever considered by the Aquino administration? Seeing the rabid trust in the US del Rosario applied in his handling of the row and the narrow legal lens through which Carpio sees things, the elephant in the room seems to have been missed here. Again, any leader worth his or her salt would have considered the big picture — one that both encompasses and includes factors beyond what the underlings prefer to specialise in.
With the Philippine Bar Association involved in this, it is likely they will muddle the culpability of Carpio, del Rosario, Aquino, Trillanes, and all the stooges of the Second Aquino Administration behind legalese smoke and mirrors. This is a dishonest tactic considering that the other party in this affair — China — does not use all that legal mumbo-jumbo to frame its position on this matter. President Duterte is within his right to frame the Scarborough Shoal fiasco from the perspective of the chief executive that he is — not from the mere legal regard that Carpio and his pals in the PBA prefer. As leader of the Filipino people Duterte’s job is to expose the full picture — beyond Carpio’s lawyerly pomposity — of what the South China Sea means to the Philippines.",Politics
SO WHAT if presidential spox Harry Roque represents Duterte in the South China Sea debate with The Liar Justice Carpio?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/so-what-if-presidential-spox-harry-roque-represents-duterte-in-the-south-china-sea-debate-with-the-liar-justice-carpio/,"Things are moving fast! Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has delegated to his spokesperson lawyer Harry Roque the task of debating Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio on the South China Sea debacle. As expected (they are so predictable) the Yellowtards (the bloc within the Philippine Opposition rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) are giving one another mutual high-fives and, you guessed it, trending the quaint Twitter hashtag #DuterteDuwag. Does this change anything? Read my previous article “What to expect from the South China Sea debate between President Duterte and former SC Justice Carpio” and you will notice that the point of the debate is not hinged on who represents the Office of the Philippine President in this debate. Indeed, even before Duterte had responded, Carpio had already done significant damage to the position of Yellowtardom by essentially throwing under the bus his partner-in-crime former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario who is now left to fend for himself on the matter of his role in the loss of Scarborough Shoal to China in 2012.
The Yellowtards evidently miss the whole point and the real significance of this debate. This debate presents a chance to bring to the fore on national television the truth about the lies propagated by Carpio and del Rosario about the Philippines’ so-called “win” in The Hague spun by the previous administration of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. While they focus on the non sequitur of painting Duterte as a coward (again shooting themselves in the foot as this is unlikely to put even the slightest dent on his popularity), Malacanang is very likely busying itself sharpening its weapons as I write this. Contrary to their assertion that Duterte had “run away” from his own challenge, what he had done is delegate the task as a true Chief Executive would. Roque, after all, is a senior cabinet member and no less than the Presidential Spokesperson. As Duterte’s delegate in this debate with Carpio, he will speak for the President.
Perhaps it is understandable that the Yellowtards are clueless about the notion of delegated responsibility. Indeed, no less than del Rosario who now stands alone as the Aquino administration’s fall guy in the aftermath of the Scarborough Shoal debacle, is a victim of this Yellowtard cluelessness. Del Rosario, in principle, acted as delegate of former President Aquino when he allegedly called the shots in 2012. Trouble is, Aquino is nowhere to be seen today and del Rosario is left holding the proverbial stinky baby. For his part, Carpio’s stated agenda in this debate is to wash himself clean of the Scarborough disaster as well. Poor del Rosario, indeed.
If the Yellowtards are sincere about their focus on the well being of the Filipino people, their focus should be on the insights that are expected to emerge from this debate. Evidently they are more concerned about their be-all-end-all agenda which is to seize power one way or another; illegally by ousting Duterte extra-constitutionally in their trademark “people power revolution”, by holding him to his promise to “resign” if he loses this debate, or legally in the 2022 elections which they have so far exhibited little capability to win.
Whether it is Duterte or Roque who ends up facing off with The Liar Antonio Carpio, the ultimate outcome of this debate will be the truth about what the South China Sea really means to ordinary Filipinos — jack squat. The “win” in The Hague they were made to believe was delivered to them by the Aquino administration is, as Duterte pointed out, not worth the documents it was printed on. The legal arguments Carpio will be bandying around in this debate mean nothing when one considers that China’s position on the matter is not framed by those terms. In short, the bottom line here is that this South China Sea dispute will be settled by military might — something the Philippines does not have thanks to the constant demonisation of its military perpetrated by Carpio’s Yellowtard camp and their communist minions.
Lawyers — specially liars like Antonio Carpio — will not determine the future of the Philippines’ claim to the South China Sea. Warships, missiles, and good soldiers will.",Politics
Andaya Names The Albatrosses Around VP Leni’s Neck,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/andaya-names-the-albatrosses-around-vp-lenis-neck/,"I don’t know what to make of former House Majority Leader Rolando “Nonoy” Andaya Jr.’s supporting a call for Vice President Leni Robredo to run in 2022 for Camarines Sur Governor.
“Tuloy po tayo sa pagtakbo bilang Congressman. At meron po tayong mas mataas na tawag. Pero ang pangako ko si Governor Leni, ikakampanya ko siya sa probinsya nang walang gastos at hindi ko siya kasama,” Andaya was quoted saying in a radio interview in DWOS 103.9 BOOM FM Naga.
However, Andaya said that he will leave the decision on Robredo whether she will take the responsibility on serving her fellow Bicolanos or she will take a higher position in office.
There have been initial talks between Andaya and Robredo wherein it was said that the Vice President will run for governor of Camarines Sur in the May 2022 elections and that will never change.
If it is a political play, it is surely a deft one that will pit her love for her Bicolano kababayans against her ambition to seek the Presidency in 2022.  While, at the same time, and this is IF VP Leni goes for it, it may lead to the toppling of the decades old grip of the Villafuertes on Camsur.
Surely, VP Leni whose late husband Naga City Mayor then DILG Secretary Jesse was touted to be the cleanest and most effective local executive, would be a far better governor than the Villafuertes who have lorded over their province’s treasury.
And so, Andaya might be right in supporting calls for her to wrest the reigns of power from the Villafuertes.
Andaya, vows to give his “all out and unconditional support” for VP Leni’s candidacy as Camsur Governor. “May isa akong salita, kapag sinabi ko na, hindi ko na pwedeng bawiin pa,” Andaya said in the same radio interview, but also pleaded not to prolong her final decision on what position she will run for in the 2022 elections.
Andaya also said, perhaps assuming that VP Leni will run for Camsur Governor, that she should distance herself from personalities that tended to cast deep, dark shadows on her image.
He identified them as Judy Cheng-Del Castillo alias De-Cheng who is a contractor, Nonoy Magtutrepor, Bolet Bañal alias Boylet Banyal, Councillor Lavadia alias Labadaba, and Dong  Cucio alias Sokyo who is a known election operator.
“Kung ako sa kanila, kung nais nilang protektahan si VP Leni, mag-volunteer na lang silang umalis dahil nakakasira sila sa imahe ni VP Leni,” Andaya said.
“Ayaw kong magkaroon ng masamang imahe si Leni dahil kung palagi kayong nakasiksik sa kanya, nais niyo bang iparating sa publiko na immoral din ang aming magiging gobernador?,” he added.",Politics
Justice Carpio and the Opposition needed this debate more than Duterte did,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/justice-carpio-and-the-opposition-needed-this-debate-more-than-duterte-did/,"Just as quickly as a media circus exploded over the debate between Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, this latest fodder for lazy journalism sputtered. What’s left is a Philippine Opposition still bereft of a winning strategy — and a winnable candidate — as the 2022 national elections loom closer in the horizon and the top “thought leaders” of its prominent bloc, the Yellowtards, coming out of it with not much else but a “trending” hashtag — their pride and joy of the week, #DuterteDuwag.
Having convinced themselves that Duterte is a “coward” for allegedly “backing out” from a challenge he himself issued, the Yellowtards (the leading bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) have settled into a role familiar to many who have wisely swallowed their pride to walk away from a brawl not worth the trouble. The position the Yellowtards now take has all to do with this easy low-brow space to validate their righteousness and nothing to do with the national implications of the South China Sea lies peddled by Carpio over the last several years. More important to note is that other big casualty of all this. Sitting quietly in a dark corner (or at least trying to) is former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario who Carpio had dishonestly hung out to dry. Del Rosario now suffers the indignity of being left to hold the stinky baby that is the Scarborough Shoal debacle of 2012 having been abandoned by both Carpio and his old boss, former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III.
By the time the Yellowtards get over doing their dance of joy around their quaint hashtag, they will realise they have not gained any real political capital where it matters — on the ground, offline, and in the day-to-day awareness of ordinary Filipinos.
If Carpio applied a bit more strategic thinking in the midst of this brouhaha, he would have seen the political value of this debate and the media bonanza it would have delivered to his fledgling coalition, 1Sambayan. Whether it was a faceoff with Duterte himself or his appointed delegate to that debate, Malacanang Spokesman Harry Roque, Carpio should have seized whatever opportunity came his way to attract publicity to his “cause”. Indeed, Carpio and 1Sambayan needed this debate more than Duterte did.
Unfortunately for the Opposition, Carpio chickened out as well under the pretext that he “will not engage in a useless exercise that will only detract the public’s interest on the vital outstanding issues on the West Philippines Sea”.
Too bad. Duterte walks away from this only suffering the itch of a #DuterteDuwag Twitter party of dubious value to the broader Opposition. Carpio comes out of it with a squandered opportunity and an alienated former ally in del Rosario. The communists, for their part, have notably not weighed in on this “issue” — a dishonest position to take considering they hate anyone who is pro-America. Most important of all, the Opposition remains as fragmented as it ever was since 2016 and none the wiser with regard to a far more critical objective — seizing power legally on May 2022.",Politics
"With exactly 12 months to go before the 2022 Philippine Election, the Opposition is in disarray",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/with-exactly-12-months-to-go-before-the-2022-philippine-election-the-opposition-is-in-disarray/,"Today’s Working Day One of the 12-month homestretch to the 2022 national elections. As much as the COVID-19 pandemic rages, the Philippine Opposition sputters. They still lack a vision to pitch the Filipino voter and a credible leader to deliver that pitch. Much of the previous year was invested by the Opposition propping up presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo as the leader of all Philippine Opposition parties. Unfortunately that was time and bandwidth gone down the drain. Robredo remains a mere footnote in popularity surveys and, though a prolific sound bytes issuer and one backed by the Philippines’ top media channels, has so far (1) not imparted to her flock any semblance of a coherent election winning strategy, (2) shown no skill nor clout at building political coalitions, and (3) comes across as a social-climbing tita who spends her day on “issues” that have no relevance to ordinary Filipinos.
Recent days have revealed that the latter is, indeed, Robredo’s comfort zone seeing how she now spends some of her vice presidential time in the company of said titas.
Thanks to significant collateral sunk into the Robredo brand and that persistent yellow shade that the Opposition have, try as they might, been scrubbing off their personas, gaining campaign momentum has proven challenging. Meanwhile, other camps are gearing up. One is the fledgling 1Sambayan coalition led by retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio who, after an unimpressive launch of his mob in March this year, scored a media circus win with the brouhaha over a debate with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Perhaps due to his chi chi Atenista upbringing, his corporate background, and his stint in the “above politics” ivory tower that is the SC, Carpio still struggles with the notion of engaging at a level in the discourse where it counts.
One thing going for Carpio is that he has the vote of esteemed national artist F. Sionil Jose who announced today that “if former Justice Antonio Carpio will run, I’ll campaign for him.” Sionil also goes as far as endorsing Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro, former presidential candidate and Defense Secretary to former president Gloria Arroyo. “Whatever office he elects to run for, I’ll also campaign for Gilbert Teodoro,” Jose writes. If this is indication of some promise in Carpio and his bid, it would do him well to seize every opportunity to gain media mileage including stepping up to the challenge of debating whoever Duterte throws at him on the issue of the loss of Scarborough Shoal to China in 2012.
And then there are the sure things of the moment, former senator and vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos who I wrote about earlier in “The time has come for Filipinos to consider a Bongbong Marcos presidency!” and Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte, who consistently tops recent popularity and approval surveys. Unlike Carpio and Teodoro, both are seasoned politicians who have demonstrated remarkable consistency, mettle, and tenacity in their jobs and on the campaign trails. Both also have top-notch PR and messaging apparatus that had clearly given the best communications and PR minds of the Opposition literal runs for their money.
The mass media propaganda machine of the Opposition is also in disarray. One-time jewel in the blogging crown of the Opposition, Jover Laurio, has dropped the ball with her PinoyAkoBlog.com having gone offline (the URL now just redirects to its Facebook page). This is not before she tainted the personal brands of just about every guest who attended her notably under-reported wedding of the year in 2019.
So-called “social news network” Rappler consistently comes up as one of the Philippines’ least-trusted media channels. Not having learnt a thing from that stinging lesson, Rappler aspires to be the go-to information source for anything to do with the 2022 elections. In their pompous manifesto “#WeDecide: What you can do to take the Philippines back in 2022”, Rappler proclaims “Atin ang Pilipinas” (“the Philippines is ours”) and asserts “We have lost so much in the years Rodrigo Duterte is president.” So much for being the impartial reporter of the 2022 elections, right? One can’t help but wonder when mulling over what they say here…
More than demonstrating our resilience, which abusive officials have exploited when they couldn’t or wouldn’t serve our interests, we will aim to exercise our collective power to pull this nation back up.
Is Rappler a news organisation? Or is it an activist organisation? The mystery persists…
The demise of ABS-CBN was, of course, the biggest news of 2019 — “biggest” according to ABS-CBN “journalists”, that is. We are told it was “forced off the air” by the Philippine government. However, the fact is that its license had expired and was not renewed by Congress. The blame for this fiasco falls squarely on the shoulders of its chief executive, Carlo Katigbak who, quite simply, did not kiss Duterte’s ass enough as any CEO worth his or her salt would a sitting president. That’s why they’re paid the big bucks, right?
So far, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards and the strangely-silent (for this week) communist bloc within it are not living up to Filipinos’ expectations of an Opposition they deserve. What Filipinos get today is one that insults their intelligence rather than stimulates it. A democracy can only thrive with a modern and intelligent opposition party or community holding it up as one of its key pillars. Sadly, with just 12 months to go, no such Opposition is in sight. The clock is ticking. Tick tock tick tock…",Politics
Convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes presidentiable bid deals severe blow to Brand Leni Robredo,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/convicted-mutineer-antonio-trillanes-presidentiable-bid-deals-severe-blow-to-brand-leni-robredo/,"Less than 12 months to the 2022 presidential election and the first major Opposition presidentiable bid — one coming from former “senator” and convicted mutineer Antonio Trillanes — sets back rather than progresses efforts to unify the Philippine Opposition against the camp of popular incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte. In an announcement Trillanes issued over Twitter yesterday, he called on the 1Sambayan coalition (headed by Retired Supereme Court Justice Antonio Carpio) to bump presumptive Opposition leader “vice president” Leni Robredo off the top position as presidential bet.
In view of VP Leni’s preparations to run for Governor of Camarines Sur in 2022, I, together with the Magdalo group, have decided to convey to the 1SAMBAYAN Coalition to change my status from being an alternate candidate (to VP Leni) to being a principal candidate for President…
Evidently, Trillanes couldn’t be bothered to engage in enough preemptive schmoozing with the relevant stakeholders to cover his bases before he went off shooting his big mouth. Just as soon as news of Trillanes’s attempted coup came out, Robredo’s office reportedly issued a statement debunking every one of the assumptions upon which Trillanes built his ill-thought-out move.
“She has not made a decision regarding the 2022 elections, and there is absolutely no truth to the claim that she is making “preparations” to run for Governor of Camarines Sur,” lawyer Barry Gutierrez, Robredo’s spokesperson, said in a statement.
Gutierrez also followed up with a later statement that “Robredo remains open to a possible presidential bid in the 2022 elections”.
And, for its part, 1Sambayan issued its own safe response to Trillanes. It sounded more like a damage control attempt and offered no further clarity around what Filipinos can expect of an Opposition that up until now is thick on shrillness but thin on conviction.
Former Sen. Antonio #Trillanes has always been included in our list of nominees, as is VP #LeniRobredo. On June 12, the process of selection will be announced, and we will invite our members, allied groups & patriotic Filipinos to join and participate in the process. #1SAMBAYAN
It is interesting to note that the battle for endorsement as the Philippine Opposition’s top presidentiables is between two Yellowtards (the leading bloc within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan). It’s hard to wrap one’s head around the idea that the top opposition coalition of a country of more than 100 million people can cough up only mediocre and downright-dishonest politicians like Robredo and Trillanes. Is this all the Philippines’ wokedom really have to go up against the popular incumbent camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that they’ve been demonising for years?
Robredo’s fandom, for all their lame #LetLeniLead hashtagging seem to be infinitely patient to the point of coming across as just plain stupid. Indeed, even with the benefit of hard data showing that Robredo is a clear set-up-for-failure owing to her dismal popularity scores, they seem to foolishly stand by an absolute dud. Credit is actually due Trillanes, to be fair. He had the cojones to issue a categorical statement of interest in the presidency. Robredo, on the other hand, despite now being under the spotlight continues to play the tired old coy game. What is Robredo waiting for? Does she need a show of hands in a massive Yellowtard rally before she can make up her little mind? Goes to show that Robredo, for all her talk, lacks any sort of walk. She’s been playing that dishonest coy act even way back. Recall her sourgrapy response back in January to a December survey that showed her dismal ranking while administration bet Inday Sara Duterte lorded it at the top of the polls where Gutierrez pointed out that the elections are still “a long way away.”
Well, it’s now the middle of May and the 2022 elections are fast approaching. Tick tock tick tock… the Opposition are still in disarray and continue to unravel. Filipinos are entertained.",Politics
Opposition reliance on Rabiya Mateo to deliver political messages proves their lack of leadership,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/opposition-reliance-on-rabiya-mateo-to-deliver-political-messages-proves-their-lack-of-leadership/,"Filipinos’ obsession with beauty contests seems to be at a zenith nowadays with this year’s Miss Universe contestant Rabiya Mateo put up as a national hero by legions of fawning fans. Mateo seems to have been a particular favourite of “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition, specifically the Yellowtard bloc (rabid supporters of the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) within it. As with most things, the Yellowtards have their eye out for any social or cultural artefact that could be politicised to further their agenda. Back in February this year, Mateo revealed some of her views on Philippine politics in an interview with beauty pageant “analyst” group Missosology (transcript follows).
If there’s going to be one aspect of being a leader that I would like to highlight, that is being honest, because all the good things will go after that. An honest leader is somebody who is just, who is humane, but most importantly he or she is accountable [for] what is happening in his or her country. So we need to look at the background of these leaders and we really need to use our minds and our hearts in doing so. Because this is going to give opportunities to our children to build a better society for their future. I hope that this 2022, Filipinos will be smarter and they will choose the best possible leaders for our country.
In the same interview, Mateo also expressed her disagreement with a statement that women are “unfit” to be president made by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. She asserted that “women are as capable as men in handling a nation”. It seems to be this statement that turned overzealous supporters of Duterte against her which, in turn, made her a postergirl for the Yellowtards. Leading the pro-Duterte camp’s campaign against Mateo was “influencer” Jam Magno who, shortly after the Missosology interview, “clapped back” at Mateo for disagreeing with the president. This didn’t help either because it further made a mountain of what wasn’t even a molehill and further polarised people over a person who will otherwise have been seen as a representative of all Filipinos.
Even then, one wonders what the big deal is. If it is a political message people want to bring to the fore — particularly one that could be spun as critical of Duterte and, as such, could be used as a point to which the Opposition could rally behind — why rely on a beauty contestant to be the messenger and on an entertainment event such as this Miss Universe contest as the sounding board? It speaks of the lack of a voice in the Opposition coming from a more average face (and body) that could appeal just as strongly but more to the intelligent head and less to the less-intelligent one. Indeed, it is interesting that the main thing the Yellowtards lament is Mateo’s failing to make it into the rounds where contestants would be subject to a question-and-answer portion — as if they were counting on this section of the contest for the chance for another anti-Duterte slogan from the Philippines to ripple across the world.
The fact that the “competition’s infamous bikini round” (as the Daily Mail describes it) is the most-awaited part of the show reminds us of what beauty contests are really all about. The Yellowtards’ seeming inability to see the irony in their politicisation of a beauty contest points to the core from which their incoherence and confusion as a political movement emanates.",Politics
Opposition “thought leaders” lack mental fortitude and rely on shallow social interaction to feel relevant,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/opposition-thought-leaders-lack-mental-fortitude-and-rely-on-shallow-social-interaction-to-feel-relevant/,"Pandemic blues. It appears that the pandemic has also affected the mindset of the Opposition. Millennials and those younger than them are all criticizing the government for its pandemic response. You see them on Twitter manifesting mental weakness. They are the biggest voting bloc. These 21-49 year olds number 40 million as of the last census. Philippine Star columnist Boo Chanco, for example, is a senior citizen who is deathly scared of Covid and seemingly expresses this in his piece today “Herd immunity by Christmas”. Who wouldn’t be? Pre-pandemic, he would hie off to the US on an extended vacation to visit his children. This is the average higher income Pinoy family set-up. Not much of a future for the children here. Better to send them abroad to North America — or Singapore, where another child of Chanco is based. Nonetheless Chanco waxes optimistic writing how it is “good to dream big, but the people must be told how the government plans to make this dream happen. Right now, based on what we are seeing, it seems a dream too big, but a dream we hope we will realize as promised.”
My Fil-Am friends tell me the US is set to reopen this July. But the US has never been totally shut down. In March 2020 as the lockdown was about to take effect, it hit me that the pandemic would be bad for those who lack mental fortitude and those who have a need to attend social functions in order to feel relevant. Like it or not, there is a bit of narcissism in every one of us. It is borne out of a need for validation and it is more prevalent in Philippine society because of its social tenets. Achievement is measured in the amount of wealth you have and all that comes with it. I’ve seen this even at the level of the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) who returns to his hometown after a long absence. I’ve seen it in the Bay Area where Pinoys working at the San Francisco International Airport will not speak to you in Pilipino, but will answer your question in American-accented English when you ask them in Pilipino. It is all about one-upmanship.
So now all of a sudden it’s not doom-and-gloom for those who regard President Rodrigo Duterte with disdain since he became President. The vaccines are arriving. Herd immunity is within reach. We’ll soon be back to normal. We can vote in the coming election, hopefully. The virus is still evolving so I will take everything with a grain of salt. There might be new variants aside from the Indian ones. Epidemiologists have said that vaccines don’t prevent infection but only temper the severity of the same. Booster shots may be required in the future. Containment is still an issue as seen in the recent cases of Singapore Thailand, Taiwan and Japan.
Unfortunately, even in light of all this, the Opposition fails to step up and uplift its rhetoric. Its members are like children who throw temper tantrums and are appeased only later on after they get what they want. It makes you wonder how they can claim they can do better than Duterte with this kind of mindset. I’ve come to think that the whole caboodle is a collection of individuals with narcissistic personality disorder. They claim Duterte is a narcissist but this is just them doing an unoriginal take of what was levelled by US media against former US President Donald Trump. Think about how they don’t respond well to criticism and cannot engage in a rational argument without resorting to insults. Think of how they devalue the masa by labelling them “bobotante”. Think of how they can’t accept the consequences of their actions. They always lay the blame on other persons much like how former President Noynoy Aquino did with his predecessor, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. But the best proof thus far is how they put down a septuagenarian, Duterte, and a nonagenarian, Juan Ponce Enrile, who engaged in an interesting discussion about the South China Sea dispute the other night. The President was humble enough and the former Senator was like a professor teaching a graduate student about the nuances of government, foreign policy and geopolitics.
All the important insights brought to light by the two men seem to have been lost to supposedly seasoned “journalists” and so-called “intellectuals” like Inday Espina Varona and Richard Heydarian. Rather than address the points raised in that conversation, Varona makes low-brow crack about Enrile’s age “imagining formaldehyde wafting from [her] micro screen”. Heydarian, for his part, can only propose that Enrile shut up on account or his age. “Pahinga muna po MANG J,” he says. Agism is an ironic part of the disente arsenal, it seems. For his part, human rights honcho Caloy Conde shows how much of an ideas man he is exhibiting a typically-schoolyard taunt in place of valid arguments that address the issue.
Indeed, it would really help the cause of the opposition if they out forth their ideas on “enforcement” and addressed the issue of how Scarborough Shoal was lost during the time of Aquino, former Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario, former Ambassador Jose Cuisia, and former Senator Antonio Trillanes. It’s easy to make a meme but hard to sell your version of the truth if it’s based on a lie.
The problem with the Opposition is this is what they always resort to when faced with the others side of an issue which they are using against the government. This is why they don’t register with the public as credible. Respect is a major virtue the Opposition lacks. It is different when the shoe is on the other foot as we have seen how then Senate President Enrile deferred to President Aquino. The Spanish refer to it as urbanidad y civilidad and the opposition sorely lacks both.",Politics
Apology accepted Ms Angel Locsin,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/apology-accepted-ms-angel-locsin/,"The Opposition is now on the Defense following the debacle that was ABS-CBN starlet Angel Locsin’s community pantry birthday bash (pardon the pun). What started as a nod to the renowned Filipino tradition of birthday celebrants hosting “palamon” (food treat to friends and, in the case of politicians and VIPs, the community) turned into something just short of The Great Wowowee Stampede of 2006 that left 88 dead.
Locsin was turned into a larger-than-life personality by her fandom even before this disaster owing to her portrayal of Filipino folk superhero Darna in the 2005 GMA Network TV fantasy-drama Darna. Not content with muddling together real life and reel life, Opposition partisans latched on to Locsin’s activism as well making her a key personality in their campaign to vilify the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Such vilification campaigns have been revealed to be a lazy strategy applied by an intellectually-bankrupt Opposition that, with just 12 months to go before the next national elections, still lack a coherent campaign platform and a “winnable” leader.
So now consistent with the low quality of the brains applied to their rhetoric, the position the chi chi “activists” and “thought leaders” of the Opposition have taken in light of the evidently ill-thought-out and ultimately ill-fated community pantry circus staged yesterday is to highlight that Locsin has since apologised. Served with a good helping of whataboutism to their choir, this has since been the cornerstone of the broader politicised apologism Opposition “influencers” have been screaming out on social media.
Of course most can easily see through all that and read the dishonest subtext of this quaint celebrity apology bannering — that “we” need to be excused for this debacle because the “poor” needed to be “helped” and that there were so many of this “poor” because Duterte “didn’t do his job”.
Well, to be fair, whatever works, right?
If the Opposition choose to float their boat by using Duterte — yet again — as a scapegoat for the failure of Locsin’s little fete to achieve its “good” intent, then by all means they should knock themselves out. The only thing to look out for is whether this approach actually adds converted Filipino voters to their bid to win in 2022. For those who harbour plans to illegally unseat Duterte before them, perhaps take stock to see whether community pantries can be framed as “the new people power” movement.
If nothing of this sort of political capital comes out of all this shrill posturing then at least pause to reflect. A life had been lost and a starlet is in tears begging people to accept her apology. And for what? No winnability for the Opposition and no “people power” for the anarchists. For my part, I have this to make ambag as a consolation: Apology accepted, Ms Angel Locsin.",Politics
Turning Ana Patricia Non into a celebrity is not going to end well…,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/turning-ana-patricia-non-into-a-celebrity-is-not-going-to-end-well/,"It’s official. Ana Patricia Non, founder of the Maginhawa Street Community Pantry is now a celebrity. She’s become the postergirl of the latest charity industry that is this week’s buzz on the social media spaces populated by the Philippines’ politically-passionate.
Initially, “progressive groups” — the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and their henchmen the communists — were put on notice for baldly politicising what one would reasonably have assumed to be a spontaneous grassroots-originated community initiative. Non, to be fair, is entitled to enjoy the benefit of the doubt that her intentions were pure and that she was an accidental celebrity created by the Yellowtards’ and communists’ insatiable hunger for “heroes” to use as fodder for their dishonest rhetoric. Ironically, it is this very politicisation that brought to the fore Non’s ideological leanings, evidence to which she, interestingly enough, lays bare on her Facebook profile where she explicitly expressed support for “mass revolt” as a means to put “bread on the table”.
In light of all these and the continued emergence of certain behaviours that increasingly reveal what could be a more sinister backstory to this “community pantry” phenomenon, it seems that Non’s emerging celebrity is an engineered one. A recent article published by ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) shines a “spotlight” on Non complete with testimonials to her “bravery” gathered from her friends. Report author Rhia Grana gushes that it was Non who originated “a ripple effect, inspiring others in different parts of the country to follow suit” organising similar community pantries all over the country. Grana goes on to write…
Who is Ana Patricia Non? Who is this lady who reignited the Filipino bayanihan spirit with a cart of vegetables—and a sign that says, essentially, if those who are supposed to take care of us have failed to, we have each other’s backs?
That the Yellowtard and communist blocs of the Opposition would engage in such a dishonest campaign that aims to (1) claim that Non single-handedly pioneered the concept of the “community pantry” and then (2) stir up a media circus to create a cult of personality around her is disturbing, to say the least. However, such a crooked campaign is not unprecedented and by no means the sort monopolised by ABS-CBN. Back in mid-2019, the Inquirer ran a series of stories on their Lifestyle section dubbed “Filipinas for change” in which they featured prominent female leaders of various communist fronts including Sarah Elago (Kabataan Partylist Representative), Alex Danday (National Spokesperson Anakbayan), Paula Janer (Secretary-General of the College Editor’s Guild of the Philippines), Kara Taggaoa (National Spokesperson for the League of Filipino Students), and Blaise Bellosillo (National Secretarty General National Union of Students in the Philippines).
The fact is, being a communist and protest rally fodder is no longer cool. One can look back and understand what goes through the mind of the average 19- to 20-year-old student at a big university as he or she regards the prospect of being part of a “movement” that supposedly seeks to save the world from the machinations of the “evil” Establishment. Sounds really “cool” right? Imagine being so “underground” and being so heroic in one’s efforts to elude police “surveillance” and being so clued in about insidious “conspiracies” being mounted by state forces to suppress dissent against “reactionary” initiatives to “disenfranchise” the masses.
Lots of big words right there — probably a messaging approach used by commies to make candidates for radicalisation feel they are part of someting really big. The reality is that grassroots initiatves like community pantries are small and are meant to be small. The way they are made out to be big is, ironically, what makes it easy to see how contrived they come across as a result of the way they’ve been politicised by a desperate Opposition. The politicisation involved here is framed by a national campaign context — i.e. to unseat a popular incumbent administration (or beat it legally in the coming elections). It just does not add up — a small initiative being used to fight a national battle. No sense at all in all that.
Best case scenario — Ana Patricia Non may become just another discarded relic in the same way Arroyo-era “whistleblower” Jun Lozada did. Hopefully it does not come to the point where Non needs to be paraded before the cameras surrounded by a troop of nuns. And the worst case? Well, let’s defer to the old showbiz wisdom on that: Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Politics
WHO is the Yellowtard Zena Bernardo? Is she Ana Patricia Non’s “mother”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/who-is-the-yellowtard-zena-bernardo-is-she-ana-patricia-nons-mother/,"An Interaksyon “report” dated the 22nd April called her “a relative of community pantry organizer Ana Patricia Non”.  But then an ABS-CBN News “report” posted on the same date referred to her as her “mother”. So the important question Filipinos are asking nowadays is this:
Who is Zena Bernardo???
Seeing that the jury is still out on whether or not Bernardo is Non’s mother, we may as well, for now, check out what she’s been up to in recent years. Let’s start with an article posted on Medium on the 18th July 2018 by a certain Dolly de Leon. In “The heart and soul of #BabaeAko is Zena Bernardo”, de Leon writes…
I first met Zena in 2016, sometime in May during the presidential campaign when Duterte announced that he was going to bury Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani. I was furious. And alone. At least I felt alone. In one of the articles I read about that burial I came across her name and learned she founded and admined “Never Again to Marcos Family and his Cronies.”
It gets better. Bernardo also seems to have been a guest at the 2019 wedding of blogger Jover Laurio of the now-defunct Pinoy Ako Blog — a blog site dedicated to the “cause” of the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc within the Philippine Opposition whose members are rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan). Suffice to say, the esteemed guests at this notably under-reported but very chi chi wedding pretty much represent the top movers and shakers of Yellowtardom and their communist allies.
Of course it is not surprising that Bernardo would be rewarded with an invitation to 2019’s wedding of the year and a chance to hobnob with the likes of Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and noted communist “thought leaders” such as Manila Bulletin writer Tonyo Cruz. The latter, Cruz, cited Bernardo in his Jan 2018 article “Bloggers make a statement — for freedom” as a signatory in a “statement” dubbed “Bloggers for Freedom” issued by a group of “concerned Filipino bloggers” (the usual Yellowtard and communist suspects) in support of embattled “social news network” Rappler.
There is good reason to conclude given these readily-googlable bits of information alone (there’s a lot more out there) that Zena Bernardo is a Yellowtard. But does her being Ana Patricia Non’s alleged mother pass the So What? Test? The Yellowtards and communists would argue that it doesn’t and continue to assert that those community pantries supposedly “inspired” by the the first of them (so we are told) organised by Non at Quezon City’s Maginhawa Street are beacons of the good ol’ Filipino bayanihan “spirit” and not the dull weapons of Duterte demonisation they have come to be perceived as.
Whatever, right?
But of course, Ana Patrcia Non “just so happens” to have a Yellowtard mother. Nonetheless, this association which, we may as well be reminded, was not disclosed up front by top Philippine Opposition personalities even as they copped flak for baldly politicising these community pantry initiatives casts significant shade on their intent. The simplest explanation often tends to be the most likely to be right. The fact of Bernardo being a Yellowtard coming up now does not help the Opposition agenda. Ironic, considering that if what they are being suspected of — using community pantries as a political tool — turns out to be true, then the Opposition have only themselves to blame for a failure to use said tool effectively.",Politics
The time has come for Filipinos to consider a Bongbong Marcos presidency!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/the-time-has-come-for-filipinos-to-consider-a-bongbong-marcos-presidency/,"Recall back to the twilight years of the presidency of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. Back then, Aquino was so desperate to shore up the flagging political fortunes of his party that he would go as far as reminding Filipinos to stop referring to the regime of former President Ferdinand Marcos as the Philippines’ “Golden Age”. This followed a realisation that was slow to come to his camp of the immense popularity of then vice presidential candidate Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr and the grave threat if posed to his dynasty.
It didn’t help Aquino’s Liberal Party at the time that no less than a New York Times report asserted that Filipinos yearn for a return to a similar Golden Age marked by a Marcos back in Malacanang…
Michelle Pulumbarit, 31, a customer service operator who lives north of Manila, said Mr. Marcos was putting forward a proposal for the future that will bring back the best of the Marcos years. She is not concerned about martial law and human rights violations, she said.
“For me, those are things of the past,” she said. “That was a time when our economy was booming. Even Imelda did a lot of good things. She shared our culture with the world. I can forgive her for having so many shoes.”
A key concern amongst anti-Marcos campaigners lies in what they regard as an “alarming” position taken by young Filipinos who form a huge proportion of the Philippines’ pool of voters. Most Filipino “millenials” who were equipped primarily with anecdotal evidence of the Martial Law years had expressed a widespread disillusionment with the “democracy” pitched to them under the “EDSA People Power” flag. They only saw the absolute wretchedness of life in the Philippines and took the position that things need to change — and that the closest model of how things should be in the Philippines was a time when discipline and order ruled…
Apple Buiza, 26, an employee of a Manila aluminum siding company, said the fate of Imelda Marcos’s jewels was not a priority for her in the next election. Ms. Buiza spends hours each day battling traffic to get to work and is frustrated by the current government. She said she has heard stories of how orderly the country was during the Marcos years.
“During the time of martial law, the Philippines was disciplined,” Ms. Buiza said as she gestured toward a group of jaywalkers dodging vehicles and blocking traffic. “People don’t even know how to cross the street now.”
It is now a widely-held theory that the renewed — and surging — interest in the virtues of the Martial Law Years of former President Marcos and its regard as a “Golden Age” by some Filipinos is a direct result of a lack of any progress realised over the 30-odd years that followed the 1986 “people power revolution” and, more specifically, over the six years of the Second Aquino Administration. It could be said that The Great Democratic Experiment of the Philippines was marked more by a wholesale missing of the real point of freedom of an entire society and a series of governments that ruled since 1986.
Instead of a stronger nation, what emerged after 30 years is a country characterised by a non-existent fighting capability, mainstream media networks that dumb down rather than enlighten their audiences, and a people that lack a clear picture of what their long-term future might look like.
The trouble with Aquino was that, as president, he focused most of his media time on vilifying his predecessor former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, blaming “corruption” supposedly perpetrated by previous administrations, and waxing poetic about his parents’ “heroic” legacies. Meanwhile, then Senator Bongbong Marcos sustained a message to the public consistently themed on the future and moving towards it. Back in early 2015 in the days immediately following the massacre of 44 Special Action Force (SAF) troops by elements of the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front, then Senator Marcos charted a crystal-clear three-point way forward out of the ensuing crisis that gripped the country in its aftermath.
While the Malacanang of then President Aquino suffered an astounding paralysis and repeatedly stammered out mixed messages to the public as the much-vaunted Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) initiative was crushed under the public relations fallout from the massacre, Marcos was in the field cobbling together consensus on how to proceed and assuring a bewildered Filipino public that options were being explored.
Suffice to say, the manner with which Marcos stepped up to the challenge while Aquino and his entire Cabinet descended into an orgy of internal bickering and incompetent statesmanship did not help at all. As is evident in the NYT report, Filipinos long before then had already developed a healthy cynicism for the brand of “demo-crazy” sold to them by the Aquino-Cojuangco clan. Even the whole notion that the Aquinos and Cojuangcos are symbols of the “Spirit of EDSA” is now being challenged.
Indeed, Marcos worked hard to save the Philippines from the clutches of the Bangsamoro Basic Law. He had, in the process, demonstrated an ironic allegiance to the Philippine Constitution — a national charter that was crafted under the watch of no less than President BS Aquino’s mother, former President Corazon ‘Cory’ Aquino.
As chief Senate reviewer of the proposed BBL in 2015, the junior Marcos exhibited the sort of statesmanship and diplomacy that the original Malacanang negotiating team led by Secretary Teresita Quintos-Deles and Miriam Coronel-Ferrer utterly lacked. Over the course of the review, Senator Marcos tirelessly travelled all over the country to consult with everyone potentially affected by the proposed law that would have seen a vast chunk of Mindanao ceded unto the hands of the terrorist Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The outcome of the investigation was nothing short of conclusive. The BBL was unworkable and would have resulted in an outcome the opposite of what its authors promised the Filipino people.
Despite these achievements, however, many Filipinos continue to hate Senator Bongbong Marcos. Why? Because of his surname. Senator Marcos’s father was the late former President Ferdinand E Marcos. Filipinos cannot seem to see past that fact. That is strange, because many of these people are the same people who are advocates of “voter education”. A cornerstone of this initiative to develop an intelligent vote in the Philippines is to change the way Filipino voters evaluate candidates running for office. Voter education champions encourage Filipinos to ditch their traditional practice of voting on the basis of name- and face-recall in favour of qualifications and record of achievement.
Yet, to his detractors, he is still and only just “a Marcos”. That’s, quite simply, being small-minded. Then again, it makes sense of course. Filipinos are predominantly Roman Catholic. Catholics live by the baffling notion that babies are not born innocent. They believe babies are born guilty of Original Sin. To erase that “sin”, no less than the Son of God needed to be put up as human sacrifice to appease his own father.
That explains the primitivist way Filipinos continue to regard Bongbong Marcos. In Filipinos’ minds, Bongbong is guilty of his father’s alleged sins.
So for arguments’ sake, perhaps we should ask ourselves: What does Bongbong Marcos need to do to absolve himself of his father’s sins? Unlike the divine intervention needed to absolve Catholic babies of their guilt, no miracle is really needed to erase the stigma of being “a Marcos” that Bongbong bears. Senator Marcos simply needs to work harder and deliver more results. And so far as we’ve seen, he has demonstrated that stepping up to any challenge does not faze him at all.
It’s been almost four decades and the national narrative (as propagated by the powers-that-be) remains stuck in a bygone past — an age when ordinary people supposedly lacked today’s much-hyped technological capability to more effectively “spring” change from the grassroots. Indeed, a people who lacked mobile technology and social media supposedly instigated a “revolution” over a three-year period since Ninoy Aquino’s assassination in 1983. Today, 25 years since the Internet became available to ordinary users and roughly 15 years since the dawn of social media, Filipino “activists” have failed to step up to the promise of uplifting the quality of the way their compatriots participate in a democracy that aspires to join the modern world.
Perhaps it is time to regard our politicians using a different way of thinking.
You see, it is only when Filipinos become pro-achievement first before being merely and only pro-[insert politician’s name here] that we can hold hand to heart and claim to be a real democracy.",Politics
Duterte is right.

In the case of the Philippines’ claim to vast territories in the South China Sea, Duterte points out that waving a piece of paper at a global power quietly building structures on territory other powers say you have a rightful claim to translates to jack squat in global politics. Filipinos, in fact, should know better. Right in their own backyard is a clear case study of how documents don’t amount to much when dealing with trespassers. It’s called The Squatter Issue. Filipinos can only watch helplessly as their own domestic squatter infestation delivers nothing but grief to land owners, unnecessarily drains public coffers to evict their perpetrators, slows infrastructure development to a crawl, and provides fodder for dishonest communist “activism”.
Wave a title deed or court order to the face of a resident of any one of the Philippines’ vast squatter colonies and you’ll likely get an ice pick through your liver in return. For that matter, try telling off even a chi chi tita who cuts in front of you in a queue for a latte at the local Starbucks and you’re up for a smack across the face with her fake Gucci handbag. Quite ironic that a key bloc within the Opposition — the communists — are big fans of such behaviour. That’s the same sort of reality Duterte describes in the context of the Philippines’ face off with China. “Nag-file sila ng kaso nanalo tayo. Sa totoong buhay, between nation, iyang papel wala iyan… actually… bigay mo sakin iyan sabihin ko ‘P***ng-ina papel lang iyan.’ Itatapon ko iyan sa waste basket,” Duterte said of the ruling. (Translated: “We won in the case filed. In real life, pieces of paper like that don’t matter between nations. Give that piece of paper to me and I’ll say [expletive] that’s just a piece of paper. I’d throw that into the waste basket”)
We pretend that the world has evolved a lot since World War II. The fact is, might continues to determine what is right. The fact that nations that truly matter invest enormous chunks of their budget on their militaries proves this. Does the Philippines matter in that scheme of things? The truth is quite simple. The only reason China is not moving faster and more menacingly than it already is in the South China Sea is because it is wisely considering the possibility of military action by countries like the United States, Japan, and Australia that pose real threats to its goals. The Philippines’ efforts at “diplomacy” are really no more than a quaint side show.
Weak countries like the Philippines continue to exist only because powerful countries allow them to. A world order supposedly ruled by “international law” is no more than a glossy pretense. No less than the United States itself has, time and again, demonstrated that its own national interests trump United Nations “resolutions” any day. Military might is the only real currency in international “relations”. Filipinos continue to bank on their “friendship” with the United States to back their huffing and puffing over China’s “illegal” incursions but think for a moment if such a “friendship” is really the two-way street Filipinos imagine it to be. Senior Cato Institute fellow Doug Bandow offers some clues on what the Philippines’ “friend” might actually think of its old chum(p) in the Far East…
Indeed, some things never change. One is the limited value of the Philippines as an ally. Its people are friendly and welcoming — and quite pro‐​American. But it is a semi‐​failed state with a military to match. Manila is a sad example of how the US has picked up the old German habit of allying with the least stable nations possessing the weakest militaries — as Berlin did with Austro‐​Hungary in World War I and Italy in World War II.
In the case of Washington the primes useless partner is the Philippines. The relationship wouldn’t matter so much if Manila didn’t expect America to protect not only its home islands, but also every useless piece of rock claimed by the Philippines against China, such as Scarborough Shoal. If Beijing and Washington end up at war — a horrific possibility — the cause should be more serious than the Philippines.
Recall that when the Philippines “won” a “favourable ruling” from the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague on the matter of the disputed territories of the South China Sea, there already had been little indication that China would be in any mood to respect the PCA decision. China had remained consistent with that position ever since. In fact, China has, from the very start, asserted that it does not and will not recognise jurisdiction of the The Hague over this matter. Second, it had exhibited a wherewithal to invest heavily in the development of infrastructure and the colonisation of various islands in the disputed territory. And last and most important of all, a wealth of precedents had long been set by other world powers ignoring any rulings by international bodies that are not in their favour.
For that matter, China’s behaviour does not really differ much from world powers that pretend to play ball when it comes to “international law”. Consider the behaviour of other countries that had found themselves in similar circumstances. Graham Allison writing for The Diplomat details the sorry record of the world’s mightiest nations when faced with rulings that their governments perceive to be not aligned with their nation’s sovereign interests.  Allison cites how “none of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council have ever accepted any international court’s ruling when (in their view) it infringed their sovereignty or national security interests.”
One of the examples he cites is quite confronting…
Anticipating the Court’s ruling in the case brought by the Philippines, UK Prime Minister David Cameron proclaimed: “We want to encourage China to be part of that rules-based world. We want to encourage everyone to abide by these adjudications.” Perhaps he had forgotten that just last year the PCA ruled that the UK had violated the Law of the Sea by unilaterally establishing a Marine Protected Area in the Chagos Islands. The British government disregarded the ruling, and the Marine Protected Area remains in place today.
As for the United States, the “ally” the Philippines is counting on to back any next steps it might take following the PCA ruling, our pal lacks any ascendancy to take China to task on the applicable laws in this instance. The PCA in its final decision ruled that the actions of China in the disputed territories of the South China Sea and its so-called “nine-dash line” are “contrary to the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 10 December 1982] and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China’s maritime entitlements under the Convention”. Unfortunately, the US has, itself, declined to ratify the UNCLOS and, as such, is not bound by it. On that note, Allison writes, “If China followed that precedent, it could withdraw from the Law of the Sea Treaty altogether – joining the United States as one of the world’s only nations not party to the agreement.”
The truth is quite stark. No great world power has ever become great nor powerful by bowing down to any other power or acceding to any agreement unfavourable to its long-term interests. As such, China’s stance is consistent with historical precedent overall. The Philippines, for its part, would not have found itself in this position had its past governments exercised more foresight surrounding national defense. Instead, successive governments had allowed the Philippines’ once-respectable military capability to degenerate to what is now less than a pale shadow of its former self.
Since the PCA issued its “favourbale” ruling, the Philippines did not squarely face the potentially embarrassing prospect of having to answer the question: What’s Next? This is, perhaps, where the Duterte administration comes from today. Unless Filipinos can answer that question with a firm slam-dunk, any notion of a “win” here can only be token at best. Considering that the Philippines lacks any capability to enforce the PCA ruling, coming up with a response that saves face remains a formidable challenge. If the Opposition think Duterte is not up to the job of coming with such a response, their “thought leaders” should, at the very least, propose one instead of spending their days whining about what is not being done.",Politics
On the San Beda alumni petition against Duterte’s South China Sea statements,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/on-the-san-beda-alumni-petition-against-dutertes-south-china-sea-statements/,"I have refrained from political posts on my Facebook account in deference to my friends who are on the opposite side of the political fence, so please indulge me on this issue of the San Beda alumni community petition that President Rodrigo Duterte retract his statements on the South China Sea row with China because I cannot let this pass.
As one who has a media background, this interview of former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Winston Ginez who was among those who signed the petition is cringe-worthy because it is akin to leading the witness in legal parlance. You have an anchor who is trying very hard to speak English with an American accent and a lawyer whose grasp of spoken English is poor. Shame considering he is a Bedan lawyer.
The issue of the South China Sea dispute is not as simple as the Opposition paints it to be. Any freshman lawyer will tell you arbitration requires two parties who agree to subject themselves to the process. How can it be arbitration when only one party is present?
The historical underpinning of China’s claim cannot be discounted. The Chinese have been in the Philippines long before it became the same under the Spaniards. If you read the history of the islands in the South China Sea, the Spaniards and the French claimed some of them during the time of their colonial outposts in Vietnam and the Philippines. In fact, these were included when Spain sold the Philippines and what is now the Northern Marianas Islands to the United States in 1898 under the Treaty of Paris.
Kalayaan Island off Palawan was first “discovered” by self-proclaimed Admiral Tomas Cloma. Cloma subrogated his claims to the Philippine government which led to then President Ferdinand Marcos issuing a Presidential Decree forming the Kalayaan Island Group and making the same under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government of Palawan.
The concept of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) originated from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. If EEZs were strictly enforced, these would be overlapping. Case in point, Taiwan controls the island of Itu Aba, which is just off Kalayaan. If the Philippines and Taiwan were to enforce the EEZs of each island, there would be a conflict because these would straddle parts of both islands.
During the administration of former President Fidel Ramos, the Philippines lost control of Mischief Reef. The Chinese built “fishermen’s shelters” on the formations. China wasn’t an economic and military power yet during this time but you can now see how they’ve built artificial islands which are actually fixed bases forming a defensive line for the Chinese mainland.
If the Ramos administration and those which came after it had any foresight, budget allocations would have been made for similar formations claimed by the Philippines but none of the sort was done. Case in point is Ayungin Shoal. A Philippine Navy ship was grounded there and serves as the base of Philippine Marines stationed on the ship.
As one who is familiar with marine and fisheries products, I can point out that our country does not have an ocean-going fishing fleet. The Taiwanese have long been poaching in our waters with their clipper boats. These are fishing vessels with on-board processing and freezing lines which process the catch as soon as these aree brought aboard. The catch is destined for both the domestic market in Taiwan and the export market, primarily the Philippines. In the consignacions in Navotas and Malabon, these fish are known as Japayuki. If we want to exploit marine resources in our EEZs then we need to have a fishing fleet to do it with. One reason why the price of fish is high is because of the presence of a number of traders between the fishermen who actually go out to sea and the wholesale and retail markets in Navotas and Malabon.
It is very convenient to blame Duterte for all of the problems of the country at present. Ginez claims he doesn’t have a political agenda. I call bullshit on this. His track record at the LTFRB speaks for itself. He cannot say that he did not owe his appointment to the powers-that-be during former President Noynoy Aquino’s administration. If you want to understand how government works, you should try joining it. I did at the local government unit (LGU) level and I only lasted eleven months. It is difficult to reform a system which is infested by leeches who benefit off it. This is why they are against digitization. It would mean the end of all those rackets off which they make money.
Finally, if we, as Bedans, are to be true to the words of our alma mater hymn, which this “fraternal statement” also cites, we should look at ourselves in the mirror to be sure that there are no hidden agenda or vested interests at play.
This was evident in the interview when the anchor referred to the Talk to the People of the President as a “show” with former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile as a “guest.” The two could’ve discussed the issues among themselves in a room but, no, they just had to air it.
The host probably isn’t aware of the concept of Presidential prerogative. This is what Enrile was emphasizing to the President — that he is the only architect of the country’s foreign policy by virtue of the mandate he received from the people with whom he has a social and moral contract with.
The problem with Filipinos is we can’t decide if we want the rule of law or mob rule to prevail. Any lawyer worth his salt is aware of this. It is part and parcel of the code of professional responsibility which lawyers should strictly adhere to. This is why dura lex, sed lex; the law may be harsh but it is the law.",Politics
Philippine Opposition still lacks a POPULAR united front critical to a 2022 win,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/philippine-opposition-still-lacks-a-popular-united-front-critical-to-a-2022-win/,"“Dutertismo” is supposedly a label coined by the Philippine Opposition to encapsulate the character of the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. It is, of course, widely known that the character of the Duterte presidency is marked by strong words, a cult of personality, and a virulent nationalist sentiment. The latter — strong nationalism — was one of the pillars of Duterte’s campaign in the lead up to the 2016 elections. Duterte’s use of the national colours provided his personal brand a stark contrast to his predecessor, former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III who wore a yellow ribbon pinned to his shirt in practically all his public appearances over the entirety of his term. The yellow ribbon has long been a symbol of the political camp of the Aquino-Cojuangco dynasty — the “decent” camp, we were all led to believe.
Filipinos had grown so tired of this pompous self-absorbed political brand and the elitism it reeks of that the 2016 elections came around with a red carpet pratically rolled out for Duterte to march triumphantly into Malacanang flying the Philippine flag. Almost as soon as that happened, the Opposition, smarting from that devastating loss, quickly got to work on a vicious propaganda campaign to paint “fascism” all over the Duterte administration. The Opposition’s manufactured notion of “Dutertismo” allowed them to put an “ism” frame around the Duterte government that defined the space within which the Opposition would be dropping their “truth bombs”. Of course, their notion of “the truth” is just as engineered and ideologically aligned with the “war” on “disinformation” and “fake news” being waged by their allies in the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media industry.
“Fake news” and “disinformation” were the additional bogeys created by the Opposition put up alongside “Dutertismo” as targets for the bombardment sustained by his “critics” over the last several years. Despite the catastrophic loss of the Opposition’s “Otso Diretso” coalition in the 2019 elections, there was no letup in this bombardment. Opposition spotters were evidently directing artillery fire to ineffective targets. One would think such a colossally-ineffective campaign will have been re-evaluated following that 2019 fiasco which all but crushed the political careers of eight high-profile Opposition personalities. None such re-evaluation happened. As we can plainly see today, the same approach persists and the Opposition continues doing the same thing, not only expecting different results in 2022 but feeling entitled to it.
Beating Duterte’s camp will require massive popular backing and it does not take rocket scientists to see that the Opposition cannot afford to spread their votes thin across multiple presidential candidates. This is the thinking behind their first lame attempt at a broad Opposition coalition, their so-called “1Sambayan” group headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio. Unfortunately, a broad coalition endorsing one candidate to unite their lot will require other ambitious bids for the presidency to step back and get behind the coalition standard bearer. This is a lot to ask of what could easily be up to three or four non-administration-backed presidential aspirants each with their own personal agendas at stake. There are, after all, no real platforms at stake — only these fragmented competing agendas.
A sample of the infighting that will likely beset the Opposition in the coming months is the attempted coup for the top position within 1Sambayan mounted by convicted coup plotter and former “senator” Antonio Trillanes. His attempt to unseat “vice president” Leni Robredo from her loft in 1Sambayan was an embarrassing circus that played out before an electorate that had already started taking stock of their options. It was a preventable setback for a lot that aspires to “unite” to survive.
To this day, such a united front eludes an increasingly desperate Opposition whose eminent thought leaders have run out of ammo after their pathetically “weaponised” issues — their “assault on press freedom” ululations, their “human rights” chorva, their community pantryneering, and their “Duterte is a misogynist” demonisation campaign amongst others — have all miserably failed to put a dent on Duterte’s popularity. What next for the Opposition? There’s still a few months ago — increasingly emphasising few. Nonetheless, as the favourite tagline of that crooked media network ABS-CBN goes, abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Politics
The LIAR Justice Carpio should accept President Duterte’s challenge to a debate,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/the-liar-justice-carpio-should-accept-president-dutertes-challenge-to-a-debate/,"Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio leads the only group — 1Sambayan — that aspires to cobble together a broad Opposition coalition to go up against the camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the coming 2022 elections. It therefore makes sense that Carpio, at the very least, dignify the President’s challenge to a debate with a response. At best, Carpio should accept it. He is, after all, a leader (perhaps by default, for now) of a major Opposition bloc that has explicitly expressed its intention to face off with a formidable incumbent.
According to the above-cited Inquirer report, Duterte “has been insisting that Carpio and then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario were involved in the decision to withdraw Navy ships from the West Philippine Sea. He said he would resign if anyone could prove that he was lying about this.” Carpio and his camp are also up against the likes of Manila Times columnist and former ambassador Bobi Tiglao who, for months, has been calling out Carpio and, at the time, Foreign Affairs secretary Albert del Rosario for seriously misleading Filipinos into thinking they had won a ruling that favoured their claim over China’s on certain South China Sea territories.
In his September 2019 piece “Arbitral ruling a colossal deception: It damaged our national interests”, Tiglao points out that that Del Rosario, in citing “Chinese government vessels’ attempts in May 2013 to block Philippine vessels from providing supplies to our 12-man marine detachment in Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal living in the BRP Sierra Madre wreck” as part of their argument, inadvertently attracted a “devastating” ruling that framed their case as one hinged on a “military situation” and therefore outside of the jurisdiction of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Tiglao writes…
The implication of this ruling is devastating to us. It means that any Chinese (or Vietnamese) attempt to use some kind of force — such as a blockade of, say, our Pag-asa Island to starve our contingent there — falls outside the jurisdiction of Unclos. Can we ask the US to intervene? Well, Aquino and del Rosario did during the Scarborough stand-off in 2012: then-President Obama outrightly refused to even have US ships escort our fisheries bureau’s vessel and our fishermen’s boats into the shoal.
With the the nature of most pathways forward interpreted as predominantly potential “military situations”, the idea that the Philippines can actually execute its perceived entitlements given its practically non-existent military capability is ludicrous at best. In his July 2016 Washington Post report “Why the South China Sea ruling matters”, Erik Voeten referencing research conducted by University of Maryland scholars Benjamin Appel, Sarah Croco and Paul Huth points out that there are “few, if any, examples of arbitral rulings in which great powers give in to smaller powers over sovereignty disputes.” Furthermore…
The Philippines’ clear bargaining position may help, but it could also hurt. If it holds on to the PCA ruling too stringently it may forgo opportunities for peaceful settlement. The ruling could also draw other countries into uncomfortable foreign policy choices between a desire to uphold international law and a desire to appease China.
In short, this paper-pushing adventurism mounted by minions of the administration of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III all but pushed the Philippines into an even tighter space — one that only military might can get it out of. Clearly the Philippines has none such.
In his follow-up piece “Carpio persists in lying about arbitration ruling vs China” published in January 2020 Tiglao had already crafted the challenge to Carpio and his mob…
I challenge Carpio, academic Jay Batongbacal, the writers at that vainly named Albert del Rosario Institute for Strategic Studies that the former Yellow Foreign Affairs secretary has set up together with a US think-tank to fool the nation on our disputes with China, and those still cheering that huge blunder that was the arbitration suit against China, to rebut my arguments and data — for the sake of the nation. I hope Carpio can start this debate by responding directly to this column.
Carpio has seemingly not responded to Tiglao. Who is Tiglao after all, right? Just a journalist who asks all the hard questions that Carpio need not dignify with even just an acknowledgement. Today, however, we have no less than the President of the Philippines summoning him to respond. The words of Major Richard Winters portrayed in the TV series Band of Brothers come to mind; “salute the rank, not the man”. Carpio may not respect the man but he should, as an officer of the law, respect the office.",Politics
The Opposition wastes time lying to themselves and to Filipinos about history and about Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/the-opposition-wastes-time-lying-to-themselves-and-to-filipinos-about-history-and-about-duterte/,"The Opposition can’t disabuse themselves of the notion that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a Chinese puppet. PhilSTAR columnist Boo Chanco, for example, is fixated on the concept as is evident in yet another one of his pieces, today’s “Is China losing Duterte” where he suggests that “China will likely finance a candidate next year. The Manchurian Candidate will likely be someone endorsed by Duterte.”
This reminds me of the columns that Kit Tatad wrote during the first year of the administration. Most were a disconnect between Tatad’s intellectual capabilities against the quality of the theories he was positing. Is there going to be a China candidate in next year’s polls? This sounds to me like a ripoff from the Democrats notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a hand in former US President Donald Trump’s election. The similarities end there. Both Trump and Duterte weren’t expected to win but they did. The Opposition is engaged in gaslighting. There I said it.
The illusions about pandemic response, the South China Sea disputes, and the corruption are all designed to manipulate voters into believing that whoever the administration candidate is will do more of the same. As correctly pointed out by former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile (JPE), the President should pay no heed to these accusations. There is much that gets lost in the wash and time is wasted. Think of it this way, the Japanese committed atrocities against Filipinos during the war. Why is no one fanning anti-Japanese sentiment? China has never invaded the country. Why is the Opposition encouraging Filipinos to hate China? The world’s second oldest Chinatown is located in Manila. That’s how far back our relationship goes. Conversely why not talk of a US candidate? Then US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg clearly conveyed that the US wasn’t inclined to a Duterte Presidency. Should we accept the dictates of the Americans as a former colony?
What has become evident now is the Panglinan and Lopez groups will not allow another Duterte or a proxy, or another Marcos to become President. The issues the opposition have brought forth against Duterte are all their patron’s issues. A case in point is the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP). This was paid for by Filipinos but hasn’t been commissioned. It stands as a silent monument to the foibles of the Opposition. In his book, The Politics of Business: How the Government Tried My Case Without Me, the late industrialist Herminio T. Disini wrote…
The decision to mothball the BNPP had severe consequences for the Philippine economy, particularly its power generation sector, which experienced severe shortages in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, result ing in crippling brownouts all over the archipelago. In Luzon, there were 8-, 12- and even 16-hour rotating brownouts for months on end. Despite the decision to close the plant, the Philippine government continued to make huge payments on it-a debt burden that would total about P120 billion when the last install ment was paid in 2007-without gaining a single kilo watt of electricity from the mothballed plant
The government could have repudiated the debt if it truly knew and could prove that the transaction was corrupt. Tellingly, it did not because it knew that if it did that, its creditors would make kindling of it in the courts. In the meanwhile, well-placed entrepreneurs close to the Aquino and the succeeding Fidel Ramos ad ministrations made a killing selling generators and set ting up shop as independent power producers or IPPS.
The Philippine government went on to sue West inghouse in New Jersey on charges of bribery while Westinghouse sued in the Swiss civil arbitration court. In both cases, the Philippine government lost; no bribery was established. Those decisions parenthetically cleared me. In the meantime, I, who had been accused of passing on untold millions to President Marcos from my commission in the Westinghouse deal, was cleared by an audit performed by Coopers & Lybrand, one of the five largest international accounting firms of impeccable integrity and expertise.
Former Pangasinan Rep. Mark Cojuangco has argued himself hoarse about how nuclear is the cheapest and cleanest form of energy to no avail. The option to rehabilitate it was on the table in 2017 but the Senators thumbed it down. This had more to do with the availability of campaign funds than the benefit it will bring to Filipinos who are now subject to the second highest power rates in the region.
This is why all this talk of a China candidate is crap. If this were really the case then former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro should’ve won in 2010 because he was then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s anointed. Instead we got stuck with Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. There is more basis to believe that the the US would want a friendlier President to be able to use rhe country like a loaded gun pointed at China’s head. To my mind, this is what we should be wary of.",Politics
“Vaccine hesitancy” latest Opposition quibble in on-going time-wasting effort to sabotage Duterte gov’t,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/vaccine-hesitancy-latest-opposition-quibble-in-on-going-time-wasting-effort-to-sabotage-duterte-govt/,"I don’t think there was a group of anti-vaxxers in the country pre-Covid like what they have in the Western countries. Anti-vaxxers came about because of the fiasco around dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, as I recall. I’ve written about why the government of former President Noynoy Aquino approved Dengvaxia even if it hadn’t undergone the last stage of clinical trials and went ahead with the inoculation of children. We all know how that turned out.
In his Inquirer column “Vaccine preference: A matter of trust” today, Professor Randy David cites studies on Canadians that suggest that vaccine brand preference is based on science…
This was the study’s most fascinating finding, and it’s worth repeating it: Vaccine choice figures most prominently among those who, having followed the science and listened to the experts, are concerned to know if the vaccine they are getting will protect them against the new variants. To them, vaccines are not created equal.
… though he stops short of asserting that the same sort of thinking guides Filipinos just as much.
The findings from the Canadian study may or may not apply to Filipinos. But, whether or not vaccine preference reflects unexamined cultural biases, it is important to remind those who make decisions in our name that “public beliefs matter, because they guide behavior.” This is true for any society.
This may be true up to an extent but it doesn’t discount the fact that the Opposition discredited Sinovac and Sputnik publicly when they were announced. It doesn’t help that Western countries are playing the same game. The old technology for vaccines is the use of an inactive virus which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies. The new technology is based on genetic manipulation of the spike protein which Covid uses to stored throughout the body after the immune system’s cytokine storm defense is triggered. The spike protein DNA is contained in the form of an adenovirus.
I’ve had several discussions with friends about the subject and believe me, their judgement is not based on science. Why? Some of them went to the extent of taking Ivermectin as a prophylactic. Didn’t you notice that the furor over Ivermectin has died down? This is due to the availability of vaccines. David will not admit it but the Opposition has shifted their strategy to vaccine preference in order to derail the rollout. Why? They want to use it as an election issue. If you remember, Vice President Leni Robredo had been pushing for the public vaccination of President Rodrigo Duterte. She claimed she was willing to undergo the same process. She was, in fact, vaccinated last week. You know how she is constantly exploiting the PR angle of anything and everything so why didn’t the OVP produce a PSA for release after her inoculation? There was even the inane suggestion that she appear together with the President in the PSA. They actually want this to happen because Robredo has a problem with her planned run for Governor of the province of Camarines Sur. Her residency will be questioned because she was late in transferring her principal residence which should happen at least one year before the election.
A vaccination PSA would have given the impression that she and Duterte are getting along and soften her image with the public who have disdain for her as evidenced by her dismal approval and trust ratings. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes cut her down to size with the stunt he pulled two weeks ago trying to unseat Robredo at the top of the presientiables list of Opposition coalition 1Sambayan. Trillanes evidently wanted to project the image to the public that he is now the frontrunner.
We are into June already. The opposition will have to start making hard decisions about their election plans. There’s only four months left until the deadline for the filing of certificates of candidacy. They have to establish a structure for their selection process. They have to meet with coalition partners from the Left. There is going to be horse-trading. But most important is which Presidentiable will join the selection process as envisioned by Antonio Carpio. Would Senator Grace Poe be willing to team up with Leni? Trillanes wants Poe to be his VP. The name of Senator Franklin Drilon has been floated. But after these, who else? Manila Mayor Isko Moreno will not join 1Sambayan. This leaves them with very few options. The Opposition Senate slate will most likely be composed of those who did well enough in 2019. But who are the new faces along with the reelectionists such as Leila De Lima and Risa Hontiveros? Will Joel Villanueva run under 1Sambayan?
Pinoys can be described as malurit ang pag-iisip in the vernacular. This is what the Opposition is exploiting in the vaccine rollout. What they have been doing is similar to that of a baseball pitcher. They are throwing different kind of pitches to keep the administration busy responding to their claims. They change-up the issues from their lineup of mainstays; the South China Sea dispute, the pandemic response, ayuda, Manila Bay dolomite, economic numbers, the National ID, and the Anti-Terror Bill, to name a few. The main purpose is to keep the public pre-occupied so they can buy time. The reality they can’t face is it’s going to be very difficult for them to put up a united front.",Politics
How to build a non-Yellowtard Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/how-to-build-a-non-yellowtard-philippine-opposition/,"If there is one big hurdle the Opposition face in their effort to put up a respectable challenge to the camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over the months leading to the 2022 election, it would be coming up with a non-Yellowtard campaign. Thanks to several decades of the Yellow narrative (an entire political mythology built around the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) dominating the national psyche, it had become really difficult for any Opposition camp, faction, or bloc (with the exception, perhaps, of the communists) to wash the yellow stain off their political brand. This has become quite critical though as association with the Yellow stain has become a virtual kiss of death to any election bid.
It does not help as well that the Yellowtards continue to presume to be the “leaders” of the entire Philippine Opposition. Even more baffling, nobody within the Opposition seems to have the guts to tell them, “enough of you Yellowtards, we need to transform into a non-Yellowtard Opposition!” It’s like despite everyone in the Opposition community being aware that there is a cancer in their midst that persistently subtracts from their political capital, the wherewithal to gouge out this cancer and evolve into something respectable seems to be utterly lacking.
It is clear that Filipinos no longer want a Yellowtard-run country. That message was delivered by Filipino voters in a resounding manner in 2016 and even more loudly in 2019. What Philippine Opposition 3.0 need to pitch to the electorate is a new vision for the country not hinged on the obsolete high-horsed notions of “freedom”, “equality”, “human rights”, and “decency” upon which the Yellowtards had built their now-failed brand. The idea that a country is great because of these should be put under critical scrutiny — because it seems that a focus on these does not necessarily lead to collective greatness. Under the Yellowtard watch, Filipinos have been transformed into a bunch of whiners. They encouraged Filipinos to see themselves as victims and, as such, a people entitled to the sympathy and “help” of the rich. Indeed, the Spanish word for “help” — ayuda — has become the dominant bukang-bibig (mantra) of the Opposition today. Filipinos are a people who need help is what today’s Opposition suggests. And that help needs to come from others and not from within. It is an utterly pathetic ideology.
So, with the 2022 elections just around the corner, it’s back to basics and so too for the important questions that need to be revisited. Do Filipinos want to build a great nation? Of course they do. Do they want a leader who will lead them to greatness? Yes. If so, then they need a leader who could be instrumental in transforming the Philippines from an Ayuda Nation into a truly great and proud nation.
But answering the “What?” questions is easy and in a typical campaign, it’s these easy questions that are used to create dishonest political brands. What do you want to be when you grow up? Any Grade 1 kid could answer that. I want to be a doctor. Mom and Dad then beam with pride and carry that with them until the reality of what it takes to be a doctor hits said kid ten years later.
The parts habitually left out are the more important “How?” questions. The Philippines, like that proverbial Grade 1 kid wants to be a great nation when she grows up. The question is, how do Filipinos go about building that great nation? Any politician can promise the Filipino greatness by the time his or her term ends in 2028. What sets apart the men from the boys, one would think, is the ability to articulate how to get there. If politicians who are making a bid for office in the coming elections are unable to articulate that how-to-get-there roadmap to greatness then how in the world can they even presume to lead an entire people to greatness?
If a new Opposition is to come across to the public as non-Yellowtard, it will have to show a way forward that is clear on what it takes to be a great people. Look across the globe and back through history and only a small handful of truly great countries stand out. These are countries that achieved great things and hosted societies of people who refused to be victims. They are peoples that took control — in both the good and bad senses of that term. If what is said of wealth is true — that behind every great fortune is a great crime — the same could be said of a great country. Behind every great country is a great atrocity.
For now let’s reflect on that fact and think about whether this is something we Filipinos have a stomach to take into account when we chart our course to greatness. More imporantly, Filipinos should think about whether the sort of leader they want to see come to power in 2022 is the sort of leader who would not balk at the reality of what it takes to achieve that greatness.
The Opposition have a choice — continue working within the frame of the sissy ideology the Yellowtards and communists propagate or put forth a platform of courage and boldness that is clear on what it takes to be a great people.",Politics
Opposition horse-trading shaped by energy oligarchs vying for control over oil and gas in West Philippine Sea,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/opposition-horse-trading-shaped-by-energy-oligarchs-vying-for-control-over-oil-and-gas-in-west-philippine-sea/,"So now journalists have to get their stories from Facebook posts. In her Inquirer report “Control of West PH Sea oil seen in takeover of Malampaya project”, Frances Mangosing uses a statement from a certain “security expert” named Jay Batongbacal as reference to highlight how a takeover of the Malampaya gas project by Dennis Uy’s Udenna Corporation could “seriously influence and control any further offshore petroleum development in the West Philippine Sea” and, therefore, “was a development that needed closer scrutiny.” According to Mangosing, these are statements Batongbacal “said on Facebook” although no links to any such Facebook posts were provided in her “report”. How things have changed in Philippine “journalism” — new lows are being plumbed in editorial standards.
Nonetheless, Mangosing continues her “report” pointing out that, in considering that the Malampaya field is a “dying gas deposit” and that further investment there would not make sense in the long run, the “expense of extraction will outweigh the profit of selling and using the resource”. The point of the report, it seems, is to raise suspicion over Uy’s acquisition of this “depleting reserve”. Mangosing writes (quoting her Facebook source) that “Uy could suddenly gain advantage through the existing 501-kilometer underwater pipeline that carries natural gas from the Camago-Malampaya Reserve through Linapacan around Mindoro to Batangas, from where it is piped into three natural gas power plants.”
“The pipeline can make or break the commercial viability of any large petroleum reserves in those areas, especially SC 57, 58, 72, and 75 which are currently active contracts,” [Batongbacal] said.
“Interconnection with the Malampaya pipeline would make petroleum exploration and development of the Northwest Palawan shelf and Reed Bank commercially and technically viable, not to mention very profitable, for any potential petroleum investors in the West Philippine Sea,” he added.

Thus the title of Herminio Disini’s book, The Politics of Business. The two are inevitably intertwined in most countries. It’s only a question of the level. History tells us that even in the early days of the Philippine Republic, it was the Ilustrados who mounted the revolution. Andres Bonifacio himself was middle-class. Before the rise of Ferdinand Marcos, there already was Manila’s 400 — a list of Manila’s who’s who compiled by Filipino linguist, writer, and poet Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido…
The list of Manila’s old families was based on wealth, education, influence, prominence, achievement, breeding and “good taste.” Ms Subido mentioned in her column that if she had failed to include names that should be included, anyone should feel free to drop her a note.
She further explained that there were many prominent families in other parts of the Philippines, but they never moved to Manila proper, and thus, did not become part of Manila’s 400.
Pictures depict the beauty and grandeur of Manila which justifies how very apt that it was described as the Pearl of the Orient. It was a melting pot of Americans, Europeans and Asians who were traders. It had a sizable expatriate community. The post-Marcos period saw the rise of the Filipino-Chinese “Chinoy” taipans. The (in-full- and partly-) ethnic Spanish mestizos were displaced by the economic evolution. It’s the Chinese adage that’s applicable; first generation coolie becomes rich, second generation is spendthrift, third generation coolie again. Well not all of them. Most of them are either in Madre España, North America and Australia.

It was Marcos who first explored for oil in Palawan at the behest of then Energy Minister Geronimo Velasco. The Nido oil field wasn’t large enough to supply the country’s requirements but it proved that the resources were there. Since then, the exploration activities hasn’t moved forward until Malampaya came along. Energy security is essential to long-term economic growth. Marcos envisioned the country having nine nuclear power plants by 1989. The economic crisis of the 70s to the 80s were all triggered by oil price shocks brought about by conflict in the Middle East. The US itself had been remiss in energy security. By 1969, it had run through its domestic reserves. This led to its withdrawal from the gold standard. The world’s largest economy experienced economic stagflation. And when the US sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.
Much of the economic problems of the Philippines were brought about the global economy being in the rut during those times. It didn’t help that the US began its hatchet job on Marcos after he refused to extend the Bell Trade Act which granted Americans parity rights when it expired in 1974. The Great Ilokano follows this up with the imposition of rent on the US military bases in the Philippines. Marcos incurred the ire of the Great White Father which put him squarely in their sights. We are well-aware of what happened post-Marcos.
It was only President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) who had the audacity to implement economic reforms which had long-term impacts. This set the stage for economic growth but resulted in a hybrid economy; consumption-driven but not high income. The financial crisis of 2008 brought interest rates to their lowest in history. This fueled consumption as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) were sending back monies which became the engine of growth.
Each administration sees the rise of businessmen who break into the old circle of cronies. Contrary to the Yellowidiots’ claim, they never got rid of “cronyism”. As Disini stated in his book, the old Marcos cronies had the foresight to switch sides before the fall came. Jaime Zobel De Ayala is the former Philippine Ambassador to the Court of St. James, technically the UK. When it was convenient, he switched his support to then president Cory Aquino. Remember how Makati was the center of protest rallies against Marcos? The yellow confetti made from the telephone directory’s yellow pages made for good optics.
The victory of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016 gave rise to Dennis Uy, the Chinoy taipan who made his fortune in Diwalwal. Uy has been gobbling up companies left and right in moves which appear to be bereft of strategic impact. His acquisition of the Shell stake in Malampaya is ominous because it sets the tone for the 2022 election given the oligarchs who form the consortium holding the service contract for oil and gas exploration in the Recto Bank. The timing of the acquisition is a key element in the unfolding power play. Batangas is now the energy capital of the country due to the number of LNG terminals being built. Even the normally staid Batangas Governor Dodo Mandanas is in on the action given his wife, Regina Ongsiako Reyes is flush with cash after the division of the Ongsiako estate among its branches.
If we go by the oligarchs involved in the energy sector and their political affiliations, it’s safe to say that the Lopez and Manny Pangilinan’s MVP groups will be fielding a candidate for 2022. But whoever they run gets trumped by a Daughterte-Duterte tandem, which was hinted at the other day by no less than the President himself. Secretary Sonny Dominguez’s tax reform package is about to pass Congress. The economic cha-cha made simple by the phrase “unless otherwise provided for by law” is only encountering resistance from the Senators. This is understandable because it’s an election year and they don’t want to upset their patrons as they have a need for campaign funds. The operative word is continuity. Why would one stop short of what has been achieved in six years when the work isn’t done yet?
Mark your calendars folks. June 12 is when the opposition lays their cards on the table. If they don’t present an alternative platform of government at this time, their chances of victory in 2022 become dimmer.",Politics
Looking back: Marawi City may have been sacrificed to allow US military interests to remain in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/looking-back-marawi-city-may-have-been-sacrificed-to-allow-us-military-interests-to-remain-in-the-philippines/,"The tangled web of the Philippine police and military which links the latter to criminal gangs and other lawless elements has long been whispered about specially in the provinces where it’s mostly an open secret. Friends who have close friends whose relatives are officers in the police and military establishments have informally confirmed these links. Officers who are true to their oath and code have been forced into submission in to ensure their rise in the ranks.
The terrorist attack in Marawi City in 2017 appears to have stemmed from a botched rescue attempt for Isnilon Hapilon, the leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), who was reportedly undergoing medical treatment in Marawi from wounds suffered in an Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) offensive in Sulu.  There were also unverified reports that the Marawi incident was a plan to destabilize the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. The President, at the time, had left for Russia on an official visit of high significance because this was only the second time a Philippine President would be visiting Russia. The first had been Ferdinand Marcos. Duterte was seeking to expand Russo-Filipino relations which has been moribund owing to the country’s close ties to the US. The President’s new independent foreign policy is more focused on developing ties with states formerly considered as pariahs by the United States.
The story goes that the ASG was a creation of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), together with its number one agent in the Philippines, the noisy Filipino schooled at the US Military Academy. The agent had advised his US principals that it would be politically impossible for the government to allow the entry of US forces on a more permanent basis as before during the heyday of Clark and Subic. The Philippine Senate would not be in a position to ratify any new treaty because of the rejection of a similar one in 1991.
The strategy adopted was for the US to negotiate with an autonomous Muslim government in Mindanao. It was for this reason that US aid poured into the island in the early 90s under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao program or GEM. This led to the construction of the General Santos Airport at Tambler, which eerily resembles Clark Air Base and the upgrading of Makar Wharf in Sarangani Bay, again eerily similar to Subic Bay. There was also an underlying economic aspect in the strategy. Gold and copper reserves in Tampakan and oil and gas deposits in Liguasan Marsh. The rationale was it is easier to negotiate with an autonomous Muslim entity as opposed to the Philippine Senate composed of 24 unpredictable Senators.
The justification for getting the US back in would be the presence of the Islamic fundamentalists which are offshoots of the secessionist movements under the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Thus was born the ASG. The 9/11 attack on the US justified the establishment of a Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in Zamboanga to help in “suppressing” the ASG. American troops set up shop inside Edwin Andrews Air Force base within the city. The US pushed for the passage of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) which effectively gave the Muslims control over their ancestral domain which conveniently included the area where the US had readied infrastructure. This is why then US Ambassador Kristie Kenney had been conducting a charm offensive in both Manila and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the MOA-AD was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. It was back to square one again.
The timeframe for the above events ran through the administrations of Fidel Ramos, Joseph “Erap” Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. It has been speculated that one reason why Estrada was ousted was his policy of all-out war against the secessionists. The AFP was able to retake Camp Abubakar from the MILF only for the Arroyo administration to return to the same when it came into power the restarted peace negotiations with the MILF. The Americans were able to gain a victory with the signing of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement or EDCA. This allowed US troops and equipment to be based on an extended period in Philippine territory but not as permanent as having bases like Clark and Subic where they could store nuclear weapons.
The next chapter was the peace agreement forged by the Noynoy Aquino administration with the support of Malaysia, which had been brokering the talks. The agreement led to the drafting of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) by the Executive itself which would grant the MILF self-rule over the Muslim areas of Mindanao. The law was doomed from the start because certain provisions had been deemed unconstitutional because they included autonomy over what was considered to be part of the national patrimony when to came to natural resources. There were also political provisions which were deemed inimical to the issue of sovereignty as the Bangsamoro could actually declare independence from the Republic.
The BBL never stood a chance as the lower house didn’t even manage to hold a vote at the committee level. Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., led the opposition in the Senate and even came up with an alternative proposition which cured the proposed original legislation of its defects. One only has to look at the proximity of Mindanao to the Strait of Malacca in order to appreciate its strategic importance to the US in the event of a conflict with China. There is more than meets the eye in the Marawi incident based on the above context. It could have been a ploy to force the President Duterte’s hand to declare martial law nationwide or a self-coup if he can convince the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to go along with him. The political opposition can then paint the President as the second coming of Marcos in the hope of scaring the public into submission and get them to switch over to their side again.
Public support for the President persistently remained high and the opposition went on to fail with their plans. What is lamentable is the depths to which vested interests will go to destabilize their own country to oust a legitimately-elected President.",Politics
The Opposition are desperately using the Taal volcano eruption to make Duterte look bad,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/the-opposition-are-desperately-using-the-taal-volcano-eruption-to-make-duterte-look-bad/,"In the midst of the aftermath of the recent eruption of Taal Volcano, the Opposition still haven’t gotten over desperately trying to prove that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte doesn’t care about the people. They have a habit of looking for him as soon as an adverse event happens and then ridicule him as soon as he shows up. What’s up with that??
They tried to copy the success of the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo which originally went viral in early 2015 when the public were outraged over the absence of then President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III during the arrival of the bodies of the slain members of Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police. Recall that this was a tragedy — the Mamasapano Massacre — that was due to Aquino’s negligence and recklessness in his overseeing the covert operation to capture a terrorist leader in Mindanao.
The hashtag, in the incapable hands of the Opposition today, failed to be effective against Duterte this time, however. This is because the volcanic eruption wasn’t Duterte’s fault and it was evident that the Opposition had a dishonest agenda in calling out for his presence on the first day of the eruption even when the situation hadn’t at the time been properly assessed nor the extent of damage estimated as yet.
Even more amazing, they were quick to slap the “tragedy” label even before verifiable information on casualties had come in. This is so they could emotionally blackmail Duterte’s supporters and paint the government under a negative light. Supporters of the Opposition who have a strong following on social media are always quick to jump the gun and paint the current government as “uncaring” and slow to act.
For that matter, why would a volcanic eruption, which is a natural occurrence, make the government look incompetent? Critics were just too quick to criticise. They were already looking for a reason to hit Duterte on the very first day the volcano erupted.
The fact is, things turn “tragic” only when people get caught up in it. In this instance, the people were evacuated in a timely manner. A lot of the animals were evacuated too. Yes, there was damage and impacted lives. Yes, there are major inconveniences. However, all these are risks inherent to people who opt to live near a live volcano — risks that have now materialised and impacted their lives.
These obstructionists in today’s Opposition forget that local government units are responsible for responding first in the event of a calamity or disaster before the national government takes over. Indeed, former yellow leader Mar Roxas himself knew that. That’s what he was trying to insist as then Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary in that infamous video showing him bullying Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez during a meeting at the height of the disaster caused by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. Roxas back then was forcing Romualdez to admit he was incapable of handling the situation and to explicitly request in writing that the national government take over. Remember, Roxas famously said, “You’re a Romualdez and the President is an Aquino”.
When we criticised BS Aquino in 2013 in the aftermath of the Haiyan supertyphoon disaster, it was after the fact. It was after their incompetence, their lack of preparation against natural calamities, and their slow response to an emergency had become evident. Proof of this is in that infamous video of Roxas. The callousness of Roxas was on exhibit and in the spotlight. Thousands of bodies were already littered around town but he was still being pedantic. He didn’t care. No wonder he lost the Presidential election in 2016 and lost the senatorial election in 2019. The voters did not forget his arrogance in the midst of an enormous crisis.
The Opposition are probably secretly disappointed that things turned out to be under control and their attempts at putting Duterte down had failed once again.",Politics

Robredo and the rest of the Opposition think money is the answer to their problems. First of all, Robredo doesn’t have concrete evidence that the current government runs a “well oiled trolling machinery”. She makes it look like there is a Charlie and the Troll Factory somewhere working for the Duterte government. The claim is so ridiculous. Besides, even if they had the funds to operate a troll machine, the Opposition still won’t win. They couldn’t win the 2016 elections, for example, despite being in power and having the funds to pay “trolls”. Even when they hired so-called “influencers”, they still lost. So no, funds or no funds, Robredo and her supporters are no match against facts.
Robredo’s regular issuance of such useless statements is not helping the Filipino community at all. She is adding to their daily misery. In the same press conference, she advised the government to start the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the Taal Volcano eruption here: “Robredo says in an interview that government should start rehabilitation plans for areas affected by Taal Volcano’s unrest even though relief efforts are ongoing”.

She obviously didn’t think first before opening her mouth. The area is still a no-go zone and authorities hadn’t lifted the highest alert warning. As of this writing there was still an imminent threat of another more destructive eruption so there was no point in starting the rehabilitation then. Robredo wanted to project an image that she has all the great ideas but ends up coming across like an airhead.
Robredo also issued another head-scratcher while speaking before the members of the Rotary Club. In front of business men, she expresses “concern” about how the government treats contracts with private enterprises. She said it is “worrying how contracts are now being relegated to the background because that will affect integrity of our contracts.” Someone should remind Robredo that she is part of the government. She should be discussing her concerns with her fellow colleagues and not with businessmen. She is trying to create a negative impression of President Duterte with them just to lift her own profile. In short, she is badmouthing her boss.
Robredo is obviously referring to the government’s contract with water concessionaire Maynilad. She doesn’t even care that Duterte’s beef with the owners of Maynilad has a lot to do with how the contract was allegedly skewed favourably to the owners who don’t even provide excellent service to the people. It’s baffling the way Robredo would defend the owners of these companies instead of the people. Robredo seems to be working for the oligarchs who have been scamming the people. Indeed, in yet another statement, Robredo said she will prioritise the strengthening of the country’s institutions if elected to the Presidency. That may sound heroic to some people but she should know that the padrino system or patronage politics trumps all systems in the Philippines.
As long as she favours the interests of members of the oligarchy — which her own party mates are a part of — Leni Robredo will only contribute to the weakening of already fragile institutions. Besides, as long as the alleged fraud that resulted in her win in the 2016 Vice Presidential election doesn’t get resolved and the fraudsters get away with their crime, democracy in the Philippines will remain a sham.",Politics
What didn’t destroy Duterte only made him more popular,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/what-didnt-destroy-duterte-only-made-him-more-popular/,"As the saying goes what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger. Recent popularity surveys reveal that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte remains popular among Filipinos despite his critics’ best efforts to sabotage his government.
Duterte got an “excellent“ net satisfaction rating of +72 in the last three months of 2019, according to emailed results of the pollster’s nationwide survey of 1,200 from December 13 to 16. His rating rose 7 points from the quarter prior, and beat his previous record of +68 set in June last year.
This is a testament to the severely degraded political capital of the Opposition which, amazingly, are now a virtual coalition of sidelined rabble rousers that include the rabid bloc of partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan (the Yellowtards), the communists and their terrorist arm the New People’s Army (NPA), the chi chi community of exclusive private school students under the spell of the Roman Catholic Church, and no less than Big Corporate Media itself.
The most recent Opposition setback is the withdrawal of the case against Duterte filed before the International Criminal Court (ICC) by lawyer Jude Sabio. The case brought forth charges against Duterte for “murder in a bloody anti-drugs crackdown”. Reuters report that Sabio “will no longer pursue the case”. Most important of all, Sabio reportedly pointed out that the Philippine Opposition had used the ICC as a “tool for propaganda” further confirming the dishonesty in how Duterte’s critics conduct themselves.
Duterte has thus far proven to be a true anti-fragile political force — one that not only survives but thrives in the face of adversity. Renowned intellectual and risk management guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb has long espoused the concept of the “antifragile” – people and systems that “gain from disorder”. He goes further to define the concept, saying that “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.” An example of an antifragile system is our immune system. The more our immune systems are exposed to pathogens (viruses and bacteria that cause diseases), the stronger it becomes.
This is what makes Duterte impervious to the traditional political mudslinging of Philippine election campaigns and the potshots taken by today’s diminished Opposition. Being himself muddied enough by his own track record of unapologetic in-your-face misogyny, xenophobic drumbeating, contempt for due process, and the all-around buffoonery in the way he conducts himself (all of which he’s packaged into his campaign platform), any further mud slinged at him by rivals and critics merely adds to the mystique of his character. It’s like how in the movie The Empire Strikes Back, Princess Leia tells Han Solo about the times he actually comes across as charming… “Occasionally, maybe… when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel,” on which Han Solo quizzically reflects, “Scoundrel? … Scoundrel?” Then with a smile confirms to the Princess, “I like the sound of that.”
As to Duterte’s high profile critics — the likes of Antonio Trillanes, Leila De Lima, Leni Robredo, Maria Ressa, and Jim Paredes among others — one’s only gotta ask: Where are they now?  We will likely find them gnashing their teeth in the shadow of a persistently popular leader they had failed to topple dishonestly.",Politics
Besmirching “Dictators’ Supporters” has Backfired,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/besmirching-dictators-supporters/,"This is the very mistake that dragged the “opposition” down. When they see people voicing support for the Marcoses, Duterte, Trump or other perceived “dictator,” they would attack, insult and besmirch such people, accusing them of being “trolls.” They think by insulting or libeling “dictator’s supporters,” they are doing something good. The opposite is true. By besmirching such people, they might actually be lying about and destroying them, something that more appropriately deserves the description of “evil.”
Photo courtesy of ABC Australia
The problem with their method is that not all “dictator’s supporters” are trolls. In fact, a great majority of them are real people. Thus, the “opposition” ends up libeling real people.
Another mistake is to equate the supporters to the dictators themselves. Meaning, if the dictators are suspected of or even known to have killed people, supporters are called murderers themselves. That is false equivalence. One is only a murderer if they do the act.
The reason why Duterte or Marcos, or even other dictators (such as Syria’s Assad), have become more popular is not trolls or online propaganda. They are popular because there are real people who approve of them, who share their ideas by word of mouth. Old people who believe they experienced easier lives in older days will associate that ease with the leader of the time, as is the case with Marcos. Tell them anything like they have Stockholm Syndrome, Dunning-Kruger effect or similar, they’ll rebuff you and call you the troll. And at times, they may be right in the latter.
The “opposition’s” method of demonizing anyone who supports the “dictators,” as well as lumping other people who disagree with them into this group, earned them the scorn of the people. It also means they are trigger happy; they just attack and attack, doing opposition for its own sake. But if that’s all they do, and you don’t see them really helping people, they are indeed trolls. Seeing them getting attacked by the people they attacked first is just receiving their just desserts.
As much as you want to “rebuke” supporters of dictators, rebuking isn’t a good way to approach them. Perhaps there is a gentler way of rebuke, but calling them trolls certainly isn’t going to work. The effect is that it will embolden them to support their dictator further, because they see attacks on who they support as malicious against society as a whole (contributing to the antifragility of the one they support).
What opposition should do is focus on improving the lives of people, including the lives of “dictators’ supporters.” In doing so, they prove their sincerity if they claim to be “for the people,” and are offering a real alternative. If they leave out the “dictators’ supporters,” then it proves that they do not really care about people and are not the “good guys.” They are politically colored and vindictive, and care about their political dominance more than anything. This is demonstrated by the recent turnaround of communist leader Renato Reyes, who after years of being Anti-VFA suddenly supports it simply because the guy he “opposes” has become anti-VFA.
One other problem with the “opposition” is that they focus on personalities and not ideas, showing their intellectual bankruptcy. They are focused on the “evil personality” of Duterte, but good and evil are not dependent on personality. As if the personalities they support are not “evil” themselves.
Also, people don’t really care who help them. They care about receiving help, whoever it is. They are people with needs and if they perceived that “dictators” provide for their needs, they will hang on (case in point: the number of people who flocked to the funeral of the slain “Jaguar” drug lord). And yet another thing: remember that “dictator’s supporters” don’t see the one they support as a dictator.
The “opposition” has a lot to change if they want to regain their ground in the arena. But it may also mean completely changing the foundation of their stance – which is likely wanting to oust “dictators” and changing the ousted with their own. If they don’t, they might permanently get the image of “enemy” – and deserve it.",Politics
Leni “Look at Me” Robredo is not helping calm Taal evacuees by engaging in PR stunts,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/leni-look-at-me-robredo-is-not-helping-calm-taal-evacuees-by-engaging-in-pr-stunts/,"A picture of “vice president” Leni Robredo holding the sign “Lugaw Leni” during a visit to an evacuation site supposedly to distribute relief goods is making the rounds in social media. If you still don’t see a problem with this, let me spell it out for you. We have the second highest official in the land trying her darnedest to grab attention away from the people who had been displaced by the sudden eruption of Taal volcano south of Manila.
The threat of a bigger explosive eruption still looms in an area that is home to 500,000 people. Yet Robredo continues to sport a face with a silly smile permanently pasted on it. It’s all well and good for Robredo because she does not live in that area and likely applies no skin in the game there beyond her lame PR stunts.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) continues to warn that a more dangerous and more destructive eruption could still be imminent. Robredo’s quaint stunts are distracting people from the important things. All she cares about are her “critics” on social media. Her holding up a prop for the cameras — her now-trending “Lugaw Leni” tag — is evidence that she is putting up a show for them — to troll them, so to speak.
This all leads us to question Robredo’s true intentions in engaging in these activities. Does she aim to actually help and, more importantly, address the risks that all these ordinary people who backdrop her misguided stunts are exposed to? Is she really looking after the long-term well-being of these people?
As of this writing, Charlie Natanauan, Vice Mayor of Talisay, Batangas has been issuing statements that contradict the PHIVOLCS warnings.
Rather than use her influence to counter misinformation like this and direct people’s attention to reliable information calm their fears, and assure them that they are doing the right thing in staying away from the danger zones, Robredo chooses to work on her personal brand like any two-bit social media influencer would.
It’s high time people see past these idiotic spectacles. Robredo, for her part, should change her motto to “Look at me look at me!” It is ironic that the very people who had mislabeled the eruption a “tragedy” are now failing to see a growing risk of real tragedy unfolding before them even as Robredo performs for the cameras.",Politics
New Year and New Decade resolution for Filipinos: MOVE ON from Yellowtard rule,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/new-year-and-new-decade-resolution-for-filipinos-move-on-from-yellowtard-rule/,"And then what? It’s time we practice what we preach and be really clear about what happens next now that the Yellowtards, the shrinking partisan bloc within the current Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan, have been soundly crushed. The close of the 2010s marks the end of a decade that saw the crash of the once-mighty Yellow Narrative. What Filipinos do next is the important question of the new decade.
Filipinos once lived and breathed Yellowtardism. It had virtually become canon law within the Roman Catholic Church and a generation of Filipinos educated in chi chi Catholic private schools were indoctrinated in a mind-numbing memetic cocktail of necropolitics, Messiah Complexes, and victim mentalities. Yellowtardism enjoyed no less than two political zeniths, the twin ascents to power of an Aquino-Cojuangco mother and son tag team — Cory Aquino in 1986 and Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III in 2010 respectively.
Both Aquinos campaigned on the back of what would and had respectively become the three pillars of Yellowtardism: necropolitics, Messiah Complex, and victim mentality. Over this intellectually-stunted period, entire governance strategies would be built on the Yellowtard ideology — one that failed to evolve beyond licking old wounds and picking on encrusting scabs made out to be the “scars” of the “Martial Law Era”. Indeed, Yellowtardism is, at its very essence, Martial Law Crybabyism. Blanketed by such a depraved national narrative, there was no looking to the future nor aspiring for national greatness built on achievement. There was only remembering.
It is fitting that 2019 exhibited clear affirmation that the Yellowtards are political toast. This was the year that a hastily-rebranded Yellowtard bid to seize power in the guise of the so-called Otso Diretso coalition suffered a catastrophic electoral loss. Small tweaks in political messaging could hardly disguise the deeply yellow-tinted DNA of Otso Diretso. Even parading in supposedly politically-neutral white failed. The Yellowtard “L” hand salute remained so hardwired into these sorts’ muscle memory that the losing gesture continued to be flashed.
Very few of many important lessons that could have driven much-needed evolution within the Yellowtard bloc (and extended to the broader Opposition they presumed to lead) were learned by their key leaders thanks to a penchant for ignoring and, worse, blocking people who challenged their hallowed notions of what is good and “evil”. Thus Yellowtardism became progressively irrelevant and profoundly ridiculous as it became increasingly disconnected from reality.
Many saw the dysfunctional administration of BS Aquino III as the final nail in the coffin of Yellowtardism. In hindsight they were mistaken. What ultimately killed the Yellow brand was the way its members and leaders conducted themselves as an Opposition bloc to the incumbent government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Rather than propose alternatives to his approach to leading Filipinos, the Yellowtards took the same adolescent path of lame obstructionism. Rather than show what Filipinos could be, they pontificated about what they must not be. They sought to destroy rather than inspire. They acted like spoilt brats deprived of what they see as an entitlement to power supposedly secured by their ironic ownership of the very Yellowtard narrative that now poisons their legacy.
The pathway forward is for Filipinos to start thinking outside the Yellowtard square and get it into their heads that the only way to become a great people is to achieve things. For Filipinos to take their place in the world stage befitting the size of their population and the bluster of their national rhetoric, they need to compete in what is, in most instances, a rigged game officiated by unfair umpires. The Yellowtard rhetoric, which focuses on whining about the unfair, is therefore sorely incompatible with that important imperative. As soon as Filipinos accept that the world is unfair and deal with that fact in a stoic forward-facing manner, they will do great.
The new year, 2020, and the new decade ahead is an era where much needs to be built. To build on a solid foundation, the relics of bygone thinking need to be demolished. Yellowtardism is a formidable pillar of dysfunction that is crumbling and, as the political bloc built upon it is reduced to rubble, a new era of constructive conversation in the political arena opens. It is important that this conversation be kept honest by keeping ears — and not just shrill mouths of traditional “activists” — open and receptive to a diversity of views. Key to that is an openness to be proven wrong and courage to be original. The future looks bright for Filipinos. This is a future that cannot be taken away by a discredited political bloc that aspires to nothing beyond owning narratives, dictating what people ought to be thinking and presuming to police the technology platforms that would enable Filipinos to make up for lost time.",Politics
Filipino communists missed a big chance to up their “cause” when they criticised Duterte’s VFA cancellation,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/filipino-communists-missed-a-big-chance-to-up-their-cause-when-they-criticised-dutertes-vfa-cancellation/,"The Philippines’ little community of communists will have to decide who the bigger enemy is — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte or America. Looks like famed Filipino communist Renato Reyes already answered that question. Indeed, for years, Reyes and his comrades have been protesting the presence of US troops on Philippine soil. But now that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is threatening to cancel the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United States, they still aren’t happy!
Communist apologists assert that the position they take on the matter of the controversial VFA is “ideological” in nature while, they claim, Duterte’s is a mere kneejerk response. It seems, however, that this ideological underpinning is out of step with what the majority perceive. This is evident in how the communists continue to lose credibility and political capital at a time when even the smallest gain in PR mileage is important to go up against a massively popular incumbent.
It is actually strange that Reyes would take an antagonistic position on the matter considering that his comrades had long espoused independence from a former colonial master — a stand, interestingly enough, their nemesis Malacanang spokesman Salvador Panelo reportedly takes.
The United States “cannot dictate or bully us into releasing a citizen of this country who is lawfully detained,” Panelo said.
Indeed, one of the key aspects of the VFA that makes communists and the circle of “woke” Opposition partisans who selectively orbit them bristle is a clause that “allows the US government to retain jurisdiction over its military personnel accused of committing crimes in the Philippines.” This was a clause invoked recently in the arrest and detention of US Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton in 2014.
Evidently, there is a root cause behind why Filipino communists struggle to capture the sentiments of voters. Indeed, they need to recognise that when one is up against a massively popular opponent, sticking to an obsolete approach to winning elections seems nothing short of political suicide. The success metric in a democracy, popularity, is straightforward as a means of measuring how effective a politician or party is at acquiring power. People can speak about ideology ’til the cows come home but, suffice to say, if it ain’t popular, you don’t win.
All this is in assuming that the communists’ plan to achieve their objectives involves working within the frame of the law. Big assumption right there. Communists have long sought to overthrow legitimate governments violently and install their so-called “dictatorship of the proletariat”. This objective is justified by the position they take that democracy is a flawed system that sustains a parasitical oligarch class. Fair enough. However, if these commies think democracy is flawed as a means to achieve what is “fair”, then they will have to decide whether to continue participating in it or engaging in their “revolution” instead. It is when they are seen to be doing  both simultaneously, that they lose credibility.
Ultimately communists fail in making their message resonate with the Filipino public because of the inherent inconsistency of their belief system. With every ill-thought-out statement made by old-guard “thought leaders” like Renato Reyes, they lose their “fight” to achieve their dishonest objectives.",Politics
Why Leni Robredo’s “report” on the War on Drugs ultimately won’t matter,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/why-leni-robredos-report-on-the-war-on-drugs-ultimately-wont-matter/,"If Opposition partisans, particularly the lot of them who worship Philippine “vice president” Leni Robredo, think that her recent “report” on the Philippine government’s “failed” drug war will deliver any outcomes favourbale to their cause, they are in for a surprise. Well, actually, one would think it would be unsurprising. Time and again, it has been proven that Robredo’s political stunts have been sorely ineffective at converting public sentiment. Indeed, her little public dramas have increasingly delivered the opposite, attracting more ridicule to her person and her party instead. Why has the Opposition become so ineffective at fulfilling their important role in a healthy democracy? More importantly, why do they keep hanging on to Robredo’s laylayan despite her being an absolute liability to their efforts?
There is a fundamental reason why the Opposition is languishing today and fails to offer a compelling alternative to the Duterte Way. Much of the damage to its political brand was sustained at its ideological foundation, specifically these three key pillars: (1) the idea that the “Martial Law Era” was all bad, (2) the idea that the Roman Catholic Church is all good, and (3) the idea that the 1986 “people power revolution” cures all. All statistical evidence points to the fact that all these doctrines no longer resonate with Filipino voters. Yet the Opposition led by the partisan bloc that encapsulates these three obsolete notions continues to use them as campaign collateral. It’s an absolute recipe for failure.
Worse, the Opposition does not feel anywhere near inclined towards coming up with new material. Rather than get back to the drawing board and craft a new ideology and develop a winning platform on top of that, they have, instead, lazily trod the easy path — taking potshots at anything and everything about the incumbent government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, joining demonisation campaigns against the latest “trending” whipping boy put forth by their chi chi “thought leaders”, and making hasty and sloppy conclusions based on flawed correlations and packaging these into schoolboy “economic insight”. In the several years since Duterte’s ascent to power, public sentiment reports issued by reputable research firms showed that these lame Opposition tactics were utterly ineffective at putting a dent on Duterte’s popularity.
Robredo is leading the Opposition to electoral oblivion. Her latest “report” is a direct attack on a cornerstone of Duterte’s popularity. Filipinos have overwhelmingly voted in support of this drive to rid the country of crime and drugs by any means. Even an eight-strong coalition of “freedom-loving” politicians campaigning on a platform hinged on lofty notions of “human rights” and “inclusiveness” suffered a catastrophic loss in the 2019 national elections. The Opposition need to see the pattern of failure here. In the case of the “Otso Diretso” coalition they not only foolishly painted the police as “evil” perpetrators of unwarranted “killings” in this popular drug war, they built their messaging upon those three failed ideological pillars mounting a campaign of abject Martial Law Crybabyism, virtue and piety signalling, and thinly-veiled Yellowtard branding.
Just like saying anything bad about Nadine Lustre is social suicide amongst the Philippines’ startruck showbiz afficionados, making crack (pardon the pun) about Duterte’s drug war will doom you to electoral decimation.
The lesson the Opposition need to learn is very simple. They need to ditch the Yellowtards and distance themselves from “vice president” Leni Robredo. Indeed, any Opposition politician dead serious about beating Duterte may even consider a counter-intuitive campaign — reopening the investigation on electoral fraud and taking the Liberal Party to task for the crime against democracy it perpetrated in 2016. Whatever the chosen strategic approach, a new generation of Opposition leaders and politicians need to prove to Filipino voters that they are not Yellowtards. Only then could they hope to win an election against Duterte and all the president’s men.",Politics
