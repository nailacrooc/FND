"What? No words of sympathy from Sarah Elago, Risa Hontiveros, and Inday Espina Varona on the occasion of their leader Joma Sison’s death??",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/what-no-words-of-sympathy-from-sarah-elago-risa-hontiveros-and-inday-espina-varona-on-the-occasion-of-their-leader-joma-sisons-death/,"Crickets… As of this writing, Kabataan Partylist honcho Sarah Elago’s timeline had no sign of any tweet on the subject.
And then there is fellow tulisan Risa Hontiveros. Not a peep from the lovely Senator either.
Speaking of lovely, no word on the touchy subject as well from communist “journalist” (now Rappler honcho) Inday Espina Varona as of press time…
…which is strange considering their comrade Teddy Casino was quick off the mark.
So, what’s up with that? Why the silence? It seems to be the biggest mystery of the week considering the passing of no less than the founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) is the biggest news of the week for the Philippine Opposition. Such a strange lot these people are.",Others
Does Taco Bell Philippines Have The Legal Right To Put LeBron James In Their Ads?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/does-taco-bell-philippines-have-the-legal-right-to-put-lebron-james-in-their-ads/,"Around this time last year, Forbes Magazine declared LeBron James a billionaire.  Tonight something on Facebook made my spidey sense tingle. Nothing gets me more enraged when I see a billionaire allegedly exploited.  Is Taco Bell Philippines using the name , image and likeness of LBJ without his consent? This billionaire advocate seeks to ask some questions if this is just some misunderstanding or participation in the pinoy tradition of “palusot “. The term is defined as ” getting away with; dodging.”
It should be noted that the franchisee of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Dairy Queen in the Philippines is PPI Holdings which is under the Araneta Group. The poster couple of this mighty conglomerate as far as we are concerned here in Get Real Philippines are Mrs. and Mr. Korina Sanchez. Mar Roxas is to Philippine politics as Zsa Zsa Gabor  is to Hollywood films. He failed to get elected in 2010, 2016 and 2020. Korina believes that a journalist’s job is to debate CNN journalists on the performance of her husband. I did once admit however that I myself hold a torch for her.
Taco Bell Philippines in their Facebook page as well as their ads have LeBron holding a taco. There is no evidence that the taco he is holding was prepared by anybody officially affiliated with Taco Bell. I did some searches looking for any kind of business relationship between Taco Bell and LeBron James and let’s just say it was like looking for any kind of Noynoy political accomplishment pre 2009.
What does exist is an idealogical collaboration between the fast food chain and the face of the NBA. Taco Bell has petitioned since 1989 that restaurant chain Taco John’s should have no proprietary rights to the two words “Taco Tuesday”. In May of this year LeBron took up the same fight. Let me stress again that neither Taco Bell or LeBron are looking for any compensation, damages or licensing. It seems they want “Taco Tuesday” to belong to the world. There is this commercial which has the Taco Bell trademark bell sound and LeBron being bleeped. It is all about the name and nowhere does he specifically shill any Taco Bell products. The James family in the privacy of their own home even made this video.
LeBron has so many business interests and one of them happens to be Blaze Pizza.  This article claims that his one million dollar investment in 2012 grew to 35 million in 2017. This article says that LeBron was allegedly forbidden from officially associating with any chain restaurants when he endorsed McDonald’s. I find it hard to believe that between his financial success with Blaze Pizza and not endorsing any kind of Taco Bell products in the US that he would have a special deal with Taco Bell Philippines. Will these posts that I captured from their Facebook page remain in their orginal form?  All I do is ask questions from what I see on mass media. Maybe Taco Bell Philippines has a right to use LeBron James in their ads despite documented behavior of LeBron that seems to suggest otherwise. The cynical side of me always reverts to the old axiom that KSP is the root of all evil. Just like this photoshop that LeBron endorsed the Philippines as a tourist destination.  Pinoys are the only  culture in the world with basketball myopia and that is why LeBron has been involved in doctored pictures and inserted in local ads.  In a similar fashion Mar Roxas himself never corrected the myth that he earned a Master’s Degree from Wharton.  Only true yellow zombies can believe for a second that a billionaire who happens to be active in a team sport endorsed Taco Bell Philippines which earns infinitely less than the Taco Bell chain where they originated from.",Others
Bongbong Marcos is likely to win in 2022. Will the US intervene to prevent that?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/bongbong-marcos-is-likely-to-win-in-2022-will-the-us-intervene-to-prevent-that/,"Poll after poll over the last several years consistently showed former Senator Bongbong Marcos at the top of the popularity game — convincingly topping Robredo who supposedly beat him to the vice presidency in the 2016 elections. The most recent one, the Publicus Asia Pahayag Q3 report is particularly significant because it is the first one issued within the context of Marcos’s confirmed candidacy for president in the coming 2022 elections. The astounding 49 percent preference score BBM notched in that survey is nothing short of an absolute confronting spectre the Opposition need to come to terms with.
If BBM ascends power in 2022 to become the Philippines’ second Marcos president, the destruction of the Yellowtards will be complete. They will likely be the same shrill sabotaging Opposition that they had been since 2016, but they will be a spent force seeing that their dishonest efforts to “unify” the Opposition this year actually created more enemies amongst them than friends. Several factions refused to get in bed with Leni Robredo’s and her sidekick Kiko Pangilinan’s Yellowtard bloc and their lame efforts at rebranding and recolouring their narrative, preferring, instead, to field their own candidates. The communists have now turned hostile against their now-former allies following a tiff with them over senatorial slates.
Perhaps it is now time to turn the microscope over to the United States which, it seems, has a large stake in seeing the “right” politics prevail in these critical elections. At the very least, ensuring that a Marcos does not return to Malacanang is a matter of colonial pride. The US after all had a lot to do with the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Western Media were complicit in the elevation of “revolutionary” president Cory Aquino to political sainthood following that. And, now, Maria Ressa, CEO of “social news network” Rappler — a media organisation critical, by default, of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte and widely believed to enjoy CIA funds channeled via the Omidyar Network — had been awarded this year’s Nobel “Peace Prize”.
The planet’s Western European and North American powers-that-be are, indeed, staring into the abyss of an acute global crisis of credibility should Bongbong Marcos become president in 2022. With their local agents — the Yellowtards, ABS-CBN, and Maria Ressa — all but botching the crush-Marcos-and-Duterte-at-ALL-costs project, America may be faced with the prospect of either (1) upping the covert intervention ante or (2) rolling up their sleeves and doing the job themselves. In what form the earlier will take, short of the latter, is anyone’s guess at this point.
Then again, having suffered a humiliating and utterly messed-up retreat from Afghanistan this year, it is likely that America’s little Pacific Mini Me may be the least of their concerns for now. That too does not bode well for an Opposition desperate to win these elections. Discounting a massive American intervention this year, a glaring absence of a crooked Commision on Elections (COMELEC) technology partner and equally-crooked COMELEC head, as well as a vastly more cluey electorate we are, indeed, looking to an very interesting election in 2022.
Filipinos are being told by their former colonial masters and their local proxies that a Second Marcos Presidency is, quite simply, not allowed. How much they want to make good on that directive will be revealed in the coming months. Filipinos need to get smarter and see the shameless insult to their intelligence that is the current campaign approach of today’s Opposition for what it is.",Others
Every additional “presidential forum” media circus makes it even clearer why Bongbong Marcos should avoid them,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/every-additional-presidential-forum-media-circus-makes-it-even-clearer-why-bongbong-marcos-should-avoid-them/,"Watching the “presidential forum” organised by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipias (KBP) this morning makes one really understand why hooking administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos into this and other media circuses is such a big deal for their organisers and Opposition “thought leaders”. Left to grandstand among themselves and compete for Second Place in this year’s elections, the Opposition nuisance candidates only make it more evident to all why none of them should be president.
After just two such shows skipped by Marcos, a pattern is already emerging. Much of the time of these shows is spent on non-debatable no-brainer “issues” — stuff that any politician will likely not differ in position significantly to the other. These are “issues” like poverty, job creation, and basic services. When you get a whole bunch of undifferentiated bozos in a room pandering to the “plight” of “the poor”, it gets boring really fast. Do Filipinos really want to listen to a bunch of clowns “promising” to put “the poor” first in their list of priorities? Very likely not. This is why shows like Pinoy Big Brother, not charity and public service documentaries, are the big hits on TV.
More importantly, there are some emerging signs that “helping the poor” no longer works as campaign fodder. Beyond the fact that there are just too many presidential hopefuls promising to “help the poor” if they are elected president, it seems more like the electorate have set their sights on loftier goals like building a better and greater country. The fact that President Rodrigo Duterte’s splurge on infrastructure, the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ on-going buildup of firepower and fighting capability, and a tolerance for casualties in what is looking to be a successful war on drugs and criminality seem to be behind his solid trust and approval ratings indicating that Filipino voters have higher aspirations nowadays.
Simply put, none of these Opposition candidates are exhibiting any semblance of a vision of a Great Philippines in any of their messaging. For these sad Opposition candidates, it’s all about what the Philippines should not be “again”, preventing someone from becoming president, and reminding their constituents of how the old ways are better. Most of them profess to be progressive liberals but are generally imprisoned by their religious fundamentalism. These are not leaders of the Philippines of tomorrow and certainly not the sorts fit to guide their country over the next six years.
Would Marcos’s presence in today’s KBP circus have made it a better show? Definitely. These elections are, after all, a race between Marcos and all the rest. A show featuring only one side of the contest quite simply falls flat. It’s like watching a basketball game where only one team showed up and its team members forced to play against one another just so the show went on.",Others
SMNI should take stock of the lessons that can be learned from the “plights” of ABS-CBN and Rappler,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/smni-should-take-stock-of-the-lessons-that-can-be-learned-from-the-plights-of-abs-cbn-and-rappler/,"That Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) finds itself neck-deep in trouble comes as no surprise. Like its Yellowtard counterpart Rappler, SMNI sprung out of nowhere at a time when the Philippines’ political situation demanded targeted media coverage in aid of certain politicians’ personal agendas. The readily-evident relationships at the top make its intent a foregone conclusion. The head and founder of SMNI is none other than Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, leader of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) and the “spiritual adviser” of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Indeed, SMNI started out as the media arm of KJC with which Qiuiboloy broadcast his televangelist services.
It does not help that Quiboloy is also reportedly wanted in the United States for alleged sexual offenses.
The US Department of Justice said the sex trafficking scheme was organized through Quiboloy’s church, called the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name (KOJC). The operation allegedly ran for 16 years until 2018.
Police arrested three men in the US on Thursday. Quiboloy, however, is still believed to be in Davao City, in the Philippines along with two other suspects named in the indictment.
Known to his six million followers in 200 countries as “The Appointed Son of God,” Quiboloy used a bogus Californian charity to bring the girls and women to the US to work as personal assistants, or “pastorals.”
The women and girls ranged in age from 12 to 25.
More recently, the Philippines’ Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) today reportedly suspended two of SMNI’s programmes, “Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa” (From the Masses, for the Masses) and “Laban Kasama ang Bayan” (Fight Together with the Nation). According to the MTRCB
The MTRCB said complaints were filed against the “Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa” October 10 episode where Duterte aired a death threat against ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro.
The board said it also received another complaint about an alleged death threat and profane language by a guest on the same show on Nov. 15.
The MTRCB said it issued a warning to SMNI that similar incidents will be dealt with more sternly. The TV network committed to pre-record and review episodes before airing.
The program “Laban Kasama ang Bayan” was also brought to the attention of the MTRCB after Celiz claimed on-air that House Speaker Martin Romualdez spent 1.8 billion for travels this year. The host admitted in a House hearing that the information from his Senate source was unverified.
It is interesting then seeing the way members of the Dutertard community are now throwing monumental tantrums over the actions taken by the MTRCB against SMNI. Perhaps people need to first step back, take a deep breath, and get a grip. On the basis of mere perceptions alone, it is evident that SMNI is not being run like anything resembling a professional news media organisation. To be fair to others like Rappler and ABS-CBN News, those two went to great lengths to craft exquisite veneers of legitimacy and at least pretend they were taking a balanced approach to delivering “journalism” to the Filipino people. Rappler even went as far as campaigning aggressively for the Nobel “Peace Prize” that its CEO Maria Ressa proudly sports today.
What are the next steps for the Dutertard community seeing that facts don’t seem to get in the way of their persistent cult-like loyalty to the media arm of the Duterte clan? Perhaps it will do them well to learn from the “plight” of ABS-CBN when it failed to secure renewal of its franchise to broadcast and, following that, mounted a campaign to paint itself as some sort of “victim”, incite disruptive street rallies (to the extent of putting participants at risk of COVID infection), and tap its pool of indentured “talent” to mobilise their fantard communities to back their “cause”.
All that did not work despite the mightiest honchos of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis backing the embattled conglomerate. The fact is, SMNI does not have even a fraction of the manufactured legitimacy and engineered institutional backing enjoyed by ABS-CBN and Rappler in the times both played the “victim”. As always, pana-panahon lang yan. The Philippines lacks a professional civil service and its regulators act more on the behest of the powers-that-be than on any bases that upholds the public interest. The short of it is that those who can’t at least keep their nose clean in the best of times better learn to play the game well in the worst of times.",Others
Communist Party of the Philippines founder Joma Sison is dead. GOOD RIDDANCE!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/communist-party-of-the-philippines-founder-joma-sison-is-dead-good-riddance/,"News broke this morning that Jose Maria Sison founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) is dead. He spent the last years of his life holed up in the Netherlands very likely fearing for his life even as his comrades sowed terror across his home country’s hinterlands.
Sison continues to be regarded as the spiritual and thought leader of a bandit movement that seeks to destroy Philippine democracy through “armed revolution” and establish a “dictatorship of the proletariat” in the Philippines.
Along with the National Democratic Front (NDF) and the terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) Sison cited as essential to complementing his so called “armed revolution” the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (“New Nationalist Alliance” or “BAYAN”).  He also cited Gabriela, the “women’s alliance”, the League of Filipino Students (LFS), and the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) among others as also being part of this coalition of legal fronts that aim to collaborate towards the overthrow any legitimate Philippine government.
Various media organisations also operate with impunity within Sison’s crooked “revolutionary” umbrella. “Legitimate” news organisations Pinoy Weekly and Altermidya, for example, seem to have ready access to the inner sanctum of the CPP-NPA. In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.
Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya.
Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows.
It is clear that the CPP-NPA is an enemy of the Philippine state and the late Joma Sison was its leader. Who will replace him now? More importantly, will any of the “activist” personalities associated with his “legal front” organisations mourn his death openly?

Revisiting my regard for Noynoy Aquino,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/revisiting-my-regard-for-noynoy-aquino/,"To be upfront about it, it was impossible not to feel even a slight tinge of discomfort on news of former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino’s passing. I started blogging two years into his term, and I gave him hell whenever there was an undesirable event, effect, or outcome related to his government’s goings-on. The thesis of Get Real Philippines, which I still stand by after all these years, focuses on the cultural dysfunction found in Filipino society. Political dysfunction is a result of the cultural one; BS Aquino, at that time, embodied dysfunctional culture to a T. Blogging during his presidency was rather easy to do because he and his administration provided plenty of material to work with.
In light of his death, do I now have remorse/regret for criticizing him back then? The answer is easy, I do not. Based on the circumstances, data, and my critical thinking faculties at that time, I took my positions on issues – which more often than not put me on the opposite side of Aquino’s supporters, the Yellowtards. I do it currently with sitting president Rodrigo Duterte; I would’ve done it regardless of whoever won the 2016 elections.
But I digress.
It would have been simple enough to let people air their memories with the dead. Filipinos, however, true to form, simply cannot restrain themselves from injecting politics into any discussion. It happens on both sides, whether it be the Opposition, where the remaining (closet) Yellowtards want a three-peat of the dead Aquino emo vote catapult, or the pro-Duterte, who will vigorously defend their precarious sandcastle majority with “indecent” language. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter who started the politicization and the mudslinging first; what does is that there has been no change in the speed and extent to which the “debate” devolves into prick-waving and gutter talk.
I looked at my social media timelines, and I saw two separate worlds, chalk and cheese, in commemoration/recall of the past. On one hand, I saw the recall of those who worked with/under him, and they genuinely speak of a man who, in their view, did his best, and was generally one of the nicest guys to hang around with. I had also seen how some of the educated would speak of how proud they were to be Filipino under his time (kay sarap maging Pilipino); one can trace that to the economic growth they perceived during his term (spoiler: it was because of his predecessor Gloria Arroyo), and the deodorized foreign news releases about his administration.
On the other hand, BS Aquino’s critics were there to provide the other perspective. As I already mentioned, the economic growth is due to the sound fundamentals planted in GMA’s term. His government’s response to Typhoon Haiyan was a masterclass in disastrous disaster management. The eight HK tourists who died in that bus and the SAF 44 who died in Mamasapano are most likely waiting for him in the next life, too.
If you haven’t figured it out yet, the more privileged took to Noynoy because of how he made them feel. I don’t think I would be wrong in saying that all that “education” and “privilege” was useless because, being Filipino, they still suspended their “critical evaluation” in the face of Yellowtard rhetoric. But below a certain societal point, it became all about feeling something else – results. People were still poor, hungry, and some were left to fend for themselves. The survivors of those who died due to force majeure/mismanagement were brushed off/treated in a rather cavalier manner. It came to the point that mainstream media, despite PNoy’s incessant complaints about unfavorable coverage, simply couldn’t hide the stink anymore.
Unfortunately, the proponents of these two different perspectives have not sat down and talked about moving forward together. It didn’t happen when Ferdinand Marcos died, it didn’t happen either when both Ninoy and Cory checked out too. The point here is that the predominant way of “teaching history” here in the Philippines is not getting all the differing perspectives to sit down together and make a comprehensive account; rather, it is to propagate only one point of view, in this case the Yellowtard view,shut out others, shove it down everybody else’s throats, and ostracize people for not toeing the line. It would’ve continued to work – but Rodrigo Duterte was elected president in 2016.
While reading through the recollections of how Noynoy was supposedly a nice guy, it brings up memories of a trait that is prevalent among the older Filipinos, even one I witnessed in my own family. In the vernacular, it can be expressed as “mabait sa kaibigan at pamilya, kupal sa iba” (kind to friends and family, a dick to strangers). I’m not saying BS Aquino was a dick, but the differing recollections of how people knew him puts forth an uncomfortable, and debilitating, reality – that perhaps Pinoys will take another long while to extend their kindness and consideration beyond their own clans.
Next, there’s this (supposed to be) simple matter of “respecting the dead.”
You really can’t fault Duterte’s supporters for acting the way they did. A common theme among Duterte’s critics – many of them Yellowtards – is that there’s the “wishing him dead” social media posts. You don’t get a moral high ground to admonish the people on showing the respect for their dead when you disrespect the living.
Let’s put this out there; the only difference between the Aquino and Duterte cults is the personality that each worships. Yet the zealotry, rabidity, and the sensitivity to differing perspectives – you’re looking at two sides of the same coin. Unlucky for the former, however, they’re now the minority because their candidate, Mar Roxas, didn’t win the election; the dominant force and its constituents will push back if you “don’t know your place.”
Supporters of the Aquino family and the Liberal Party have already utilized the sympathy vote for a dead family member twice already. You really can’t fault them for trying a third time. A few friends/colleagues of mine note the impact of social media in influencing the vote – something I had always downplayed. Even without social media, however, I doubt Noynoy could ever match the emotional attachment that propaganda successfully created for his parents. Digital age or not, Pinoy emo transcends the times, but generally Pinoys have a finely honed radar for detecting insincerity. In Noynoy’s case, Filipinos would’ve been very good at discerning “pure and innocent” from an “immature simpleton”.
Lastly, let’s look at the notion that Noynoy Aquino was not corrupt. Whether it be not corrupt, or kind, or uncompromising on quality, or whatever, if the people around you don’t measure up, then your own virtues don’t count for shit. I find this situation common between BS Aquino and Rodrigo Duterte. In Noynoy’s case, he may have been not corrupt and held himself to a high standard, but ultimately he was done in by the fact that his cabinet was riddled with Peter-principles; Duterte unfortunately faces the same fate. Both sides’ supporters want their idol to be cast in history based on how he made them feel, but ultimately it’s the results that matter – and those who write the books.
Let’s close this chapter on Philippine necropolitics, shall we? I really do hope Noynoy gets to rest in peace; unfortunately his death is inevitably going to be used to revive a political entity on life support. The Yellowtards have been all about Laban (they still are), and yet I don’t think anyone could have ever imagined that their revolution required eating up members of the Aquino family. Or maybe they did, especially when they figured out how potent it was.
EDSA is DEAD. Ninoy is DEAD. Cory is DEAD. And now Noynoy is DEAD. If the Yellowtards need to keep on relying on dead bodies to prop their revolution up, then perhaps that collective entity too is already DEAD – still walking aimlessly, but essentially DEAD.
It’s time Filipinos keep dead entities, well…DEAD.",Others

The petition “Recall the Nobel Prize of Maria Ressa” was no longer available as of sometime yesterday.
All the evidence left that it existed and did attract all those signatures is in screenshots taken by Netizens when it was still online.
Who is powerful enough to have a petition removed from Change.org? Opposition “influencer” Gang Badoy-Capati may offer some answers on account of her being its Communications Director when the service was launched in the Philippines.
https://twitter.com/gangbadoy/status/1454137010977796096
It seems though that Ms Badoy misses the point of the organisation under which she served as a director. Just because there is no pathway to revoke Ressa’s “Peace Prize” under the guidelines of the Nobel Committee, does not mean petitioners can express their dissent to the Nobel honchos’ choice via a petition. Indeed, the action that a petition could instigate may come in other forms — like a mass movement, for example, that could put pressure on the Nobel committee’s inaction on the matter.

SHOCKING: Award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa is an INSULT to the Filipino people!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/shocking-award-of-the-nobel-peace-prize-to-maria-ressa-is-an-insult-to-the-filipino-people/,"News just broke that Rappler CEO Maria Ressa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is an astounding demonstration of the extent to which Ressa had managed to hoodwink an entire profession into lapping up her dishonest narrative of “attacks” on “press freedom” being supposedly perpetrated by the Philippine government. Al Jazeera reports that Ressa, along with Russian Dmitry Muratov “were given the prestigious award ‘for their courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia,’ Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said on Friday.”
One wonders if this Norwegian Nobel Committee actually did their homework. It seems all they did was consult members of a vast echo chamber that envelopes much of Western Big Corporate News Media. Indeed, if they had, in fact, used “journalists” as resources in their “research”, it all the more makes Ressa’s win quite suspect. Across a large swathe of this community seems to be a common denominator — eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. In their article “How One of America’s Premier Data Monarchs is Funding a Global Information War and Shaping the Media Landscape”, Alexander Rubinstein and Max Blumenthal write…
With offices in Washington, Silicon Valley, and six foreign countries, the Omidyar Network propagates the neoliberal ideology of its billionaire namesake through “impact investing” and a “property rights” initiative. Outside the U.S., the Omidyar Network funds an array of foreign media outlets, like Ukraine’s Hromadske and the Philippines-based Rappler, that have participated in pro-Western information warfare-style campaigns against rogue governments. In Zimbabwe, where the Omidyar Network supports a series of oppositional youth organizing initiatives through the Magambe Network, an Omidyar employee was arrested, accused of attempting to stir up a revolt through online organizing, and ultimately released (the incident is detailed later in this article). This February 12, Rappler editor-in-chief Maria Ressa was arrested as well, accused of “cyber-libel” by the Filipino government for a 2012 article. The Omidyar Network and the Omidyar-funded Committee to Protect Journalists have set up a $500,000 legal defense fund for Ressa.
Back in 2019, under intense grilling by Ezra Levant, “Rebel Commander” at The Rebel in a conference on “media freedom” hosted by Omidyar,  Ressa inadvertently admitted that she had received $4.5 million in funding from Omidyar.
Interestingly, Levant’s question was initially directed to Nishant Lalwani, Director of Investments of the Omidyar Group challenging the sense of his hosting such a conference when, Levant points out, “no one here is not on your payroll”.
Lalwani then categorically stated, “we gave some money to Rappler…” after which he was abruptly cut off by Ressa who then proceeded to hijack the rest of the response to Levant’s initial query.
Watch the video…
Indeed, Ressa behaved really badly there. She had been discussing an ongoing case she had with the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a public forum. To Ressa’s claim that she was “winning” this case, Levant pointed out that “Omidyar gave up his stock,” suggesting that Omidyar had, perhaps, recognised then the risk in his exposure to Rappler.
At some point, Ressa was forced to point out that the amount involved was “only” $4.5 million.
Only.
After a few more minutes of Ressa carrying on in her usual shrill manner, Levant finally reminded her that the question was not originally addressed to her — perhaps recognising the disproportionate defensiveness she had just exhibited.
Clearly Maria Ressa was being absolutely dishonest in her so-called “advocacy” to “protect” whatever “press freedom” was, she insists, “under threat” in the Philippines. The truth is, this was, even then, a time-wasting sorry excuse of an advocacy manufactured by a discredited thought leader to whitewash the utterly failed venture called Rappler.
Earlier that same year, no less than the Associated Press (AP) itself fell victim to Ressa’s lies. The AP had to delete a tweet it posted and implied that it was misled by statements provided by Ressa…
The AP deleted a Wednesday tweet on journalist Maria Ressa’s arrest. It incorrectly said she was arrested for criticizing Philippine President Duterte. Authorities said she was arrested over a libel complaint, but Ressa argues the government misapplied the law to target her.
This was a landmark retraction by a major news media organisation as many others continued to “report” misleading information about Ressa’s arrest on charges of libel.
Erstwhile respected “journalist” Christiane Amanpour, for example, seemingly stood by the very significantly slanted take on the matter that the AP now distances itself from…
You know a government is desperate when they arrest a journalist.
President Duterte: FREE @mariaressa NOW.
@UNESCO
@pressfreedom
#MariaRessa
#PressFreedom
Evidently, Amanpour needed to be reminded of the most relevant fact of this matter — that only a Philippine court can decide on that which she called for.
On reflection, it would have been a reasonable ask at the time that the rest of the global “journalism” community get a grip and step back from all the misleading emotionalism kicked up by Ressa in her desperation to sidestep the task she was being taken to back then. It could have been an opportune time for the community to revisit the core values of the journalism profession and understand the root cause of the crisis of relevance and credibility that the corporate news media industry suffers today.
Respected Filipino columnists were already on to Ressa even further back. In his January 2018 Inquirer column, Oscar Franklin Tan pointed out the dishonesty in the public statements Rappler had been publishing about her case after the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a shutter order to Rappler for violation of constitutional provisions banning foreign control of media businesses in the country. Notable among these was the idea that the SEC move was the start of some sort of “assault on press freedom” being mounted by the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. According to Tan, this was not consistent with the SEC position which was very clear on the specific items in regulation surrounding the issuance of the types of funding agreements in question. The SEC report pointed out that clauses that extend “veto rights” are provided in Rappler‘s agreement with its foreign funder Omidyar Network. These rights are not found in similar instruments issued by ABS-CBN and GMA to their respective investors.
Indeed, the SEC order did not, in any way, present a future threat to any other news media network. This was all about Rappler‘s violation of the Constitution. And the threat to “press freedom” was all in the minds of Ressa and her Rapplerettes.
If there had been any actual threat to “free speech”, it could be found in how Rappler went about reporting about its own predicament at the time. Rather than highlight the true facts surrounding its case which all pointed not just to Ressa’s negligence as CEO but to a seemingly deliberate effort mounted by her company to circumvent corporate regulation, Rappler‘s reporters put up mere strawmen.
Ressa and her henchwomen were actually the ones abusing their freedom by baldly misleading the public. Tan put it quite succinctly: “Free speech cannot justify Rappler’s misleading coverage of Rappler”. Ressa should heed the words of the venerable Oprah Winfrey: Time is up. So is the jig.
Rappler had, at many times since it sprung up seemingly out of nowhere in 2012, been all but exposed as a non-viable business venture and, worse, a channel out of which dishonest journalism is served to an unwitting Filipino public. Norway is a long way from the steaming Philippine political and business scene both culturally and geographically. If the trustees of the venerable Nobel Foundation value the brand equity of their hallowed “Peace Prize”, they should revisit their decision to award it to Maria Ressa. Do a bit of homework. Talk to real Filipinos. It really can’t be that hard.",Others
"Twitter shut down @realDonaldTrump, so it should also shut down the CPP-NPA’s @prwc_info account",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/twitter-shut-down-realdonaldtrump-so-it-should-also-shut-down-the-cpp-npas-prwc_info-accont/,"Only fair, right? The basis of Twitter recently shutting down the account of United States president Donald Trump is “due to the risk of further incitement of violence” that it presumably exposes the American public to.
Twitter references its policy on the nature of such behaviour and the actions it holds prerogative to take on users who violate it. On a blog posted specific to the action it took against the US president it reiterates, “we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.”
That same blog also cites Twitter’s Glorification of Violence policy…
We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”.
The policy stipulates that included as violations are tweets that glorify, praise, condone, or celebrate “attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent extremism policy)”.
As such, this draws attention to overdue consideration of the tweets being fielded by the Communist Party of the Philippines through its account @prwc_info where it glorifies the activities of its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Just one example of the impunity with which the CPP-NPA routinely glorifies its terrorist activities is in this recent tweet…
Indeed, a Stanford University report describes the history and capacity for deadly violence of the NPA and its combatants…
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
The same Stanford report describes current party-list group Bayan Muna as “a political party connected to the CPP and other groups in the Communist movement.” According to an ABS-CBN News report Bayan Muna is part of the Makaybayan bloc of left-leaning party-lists that include “Gabriela, Kabataan, Anakpawis, Migrante, and Alliance of Concerned Teachers.”
So did Twitter act fairly when it “permanently suspended” the account of the President of the United States? Perhaps yes, though I did elaborate on the implications of such an act when I posed the question earlier; Should Twitter and Facebook block Donald Trump? However, to be truly regarded as fair, Twitter should act fairly and consider all accounts that issue tweets that could be regarded as acts of inciting insurrection and glorifying violence.",Others
Today’s crooked Filipino “journalists” do a disservice to the Filipino public by delivering mediocre and DISHONEST work,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/todays-crooked-filipino-journalists-do-a-disservice-to-the-filipino-public-by-delivering-mediocre-and-dishonest-work/,"Everything seems to be going downhill with the younger generation. There only very few of the Old Guard left in Philippine journalism. The batch born in 1986 are the last trained by industry stalwarts such such as Max Soliven, Louie Beltran, Amang Bigornia, Pocholo Romualdez and the like. Other veterans are columnists. Unfortunately the New Guard who are on top now have grown more comfortable with the perks provided by their patrons, who aren’t necessarily the owners of the broadsheets they work for. The batches which came after cut their teeth as stringers with the wire services. More privileges there. Then there is the woke culture, which is pervasive among their lot. “Journalist-activists” they now describe themselves. Never mind if there is no objectivity in reporting when they bring their “activism” into their work. What is important to them is their so-called “moral obligation” to themselves.
It is ironic how they don’t see the hypocrisy in the way they write puff pieces for their patrons and in the lame commentary they let loose on their personal social media accounts where they call out the government. Leading the pack are the pseudo-nationalists of Rappler followed by what remains of ABS-CBN News. There are the others in the Manny Pangilinan (MVP) media empire, composed of The Star, Business World and the TV5 network. Reporters are following in the footsteps of their broadcast brethren. They package themselves as brands and groups. This is all in an effort to bargain collectively for those in need of their “services.”
It was ABS-CBN again that began this trend. It is also why we are now suffering from journalistic mediocrity. You have interns starting out at the bottom-rung of the career ladder writing leads for social media posts. The results are horrifying in terms of the errors they commit. From the very basic bad grammar to the extreme incoherence of one who reported actress Ara Mina “marrying Baguio City”. Back in the day, this would not happen. If it did, you can be sure that you’d be seeing your last day on the job soon. This is why the public has become weary of mainstream media outlets. In turn, this has fuelled the rise of the independents who dare to point out discrepancies and provide the public with fair and accurate reports.
Small wonder that the industry has all but lost the respect of the Filipino public. Filipino journalists have become information counterfeiters at worst, mindless “stenographers” at best as Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao points out in his piece today “Colonial mentality and stenographic journalism in PH media”…
“Stenographic journalism” is an old term in the industry when everyone knew what a stenographer was – somebody whose job is to record mindlessly what people say whether in a court or in an office. It is a job that requires mindlessness. If a stenographer stops to think about the meaning of words he hears, he is slowed down and even makes mistakes.
Stenographic journalism is when a media man merely reports what somebody says without mentioning other things that could even belie what that somebody said. We have examples right in this paper, made worse by the fact these reports were banner stories, i.e., considered the most important news for that day.
It is strangely ironic that in the age of easy access to information, disinformation is prevalent. Claims that press freedom is being curtailed in the country are lies. If this were true then why would these “journalists” still be able to practice with impunity? Another irony that escapes most is that, today, it is ordinary Filipinos being labelled as “trolls” and the administration being accused of funding “troll armies”. In reality, both sides are guilty of the practice. This is why you have Vice President Leni Robredo being the choice of Tweetizens as President. The rise of social media is both a boon and a bane. It gives those with noble intentions the platform to call out fake news and spinned stories but also gives rise to the unscrupulous who prey on the gullible with disinformation.
Watching an old clip of Louie Beltran’s interview with former Vice President Doy Laurel shows you the difference between real journalism and the faux variety which is the norm today. This is why Karen Davila is such a bad example. She, together with Arnold Clavio and Jiggy Manicad were the first batch of newbie reporters under Beltran when Brigada Siete aired. Apparently, Davila has been influenced more by famewhoring than the journalistic principles that Beltran was known for. The same is true with US media. The most blatant example is the whole Donald Trump versus Joe Biden campaign. Trump was under the journalistic microscope for his term. Biden isn’t subject to the same scrutiny. The same is true in the Philippine context. President Rodrigo Duterte has been vilified for the last five years by both local and foreign media. This is all because he has the temerity to call out the US for its policy toward its former colony.
You can expect the worst in the campaign for 2022. The truth is there are more mercenaries masquerading as journalists nowadays. The worst part is, most of them aren’t intellectuals like the Old Guard, who had principles. There was also mutual respect then between journalists and their politician-friends that is lost today in “journalists” who would rather moralize than do their jobs of informing their audience.",Others
Impeccably-timed Nobel “Peace Prize” award to Maria Ressa as Philippine national elections approach!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/impeccably-timed-nobel-peace-prize-award-to-maria-ressa-as-philippine-national-elections-approach/,"“The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Swedish industrialist, inventor, and armaments (military weapons and equipment) manufacturer Alfred Nobel, along with the prizes in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature. Due to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies.”
For what it’s worth, Maria Ressa winning the Nobel Peace Prize isn’t really that big a deal. The political nature of the prize itself is enough to dampen its credibility. Remember how the late former President Noynoy Aquino was supposedly in line for the prize when he was able to close the peace deal with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) only to be out of the running after the Mamasapano fiasco.
Several controversial awards through history had already been cast under scrutiny, most notably former US President Barack Obama’s when it was obvious that he had actually done nothing to advance the cause of world peace. The same is true with Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo received the prize in 2010. Liu also received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a think-tank that is identified with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
It isn’t fair also to categorize the Philippines under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte as “authoritarian”. The plain and simple truth is there is the tendency of Western think-tanks advocating liberal and neoliberal ideologies to conduct a coordinated disinformation campaign against regimes which they deem to be against their agenda. It is well-known that Rappler has received funding from the Omidyar Network. If objective reportage is really the goal, then why has not one media outfit in the Philippines done an in-depth investigative report as to how Rappler manages to continue operations without turning a profit since its founding in 2012? It has even been on a hiring binge adding staff and senior journalists such as Inday Espina Varona from ABS-CBN and John Nery from the Inquirer.
Rappler hasn’t given the public an objective view of the issues as it has now become an exclusive propaganda mouthpiece for the political Opposition. It has made a mockery of constitutional restrictions on media ownership and has crossed the line several times by making unsubstantiated claims against individuals it deems to be administration allies. As a “fact-checker”, Rappler conveniently keeps to its own version of the “facts”. There is no distinction at all between what is truly fact and what is propaganda in aid of the Opposition’s cause.
Maria Ressa and her local allies are ideological soulmates — leftist-liberal wokes who don’t tolerate differences in opinion, who resort to cancel culture, and look with disdain on those who don’t subscribe to their advocacies which only the educated elite identify with. The timing of the award is suspect as it is election season in the Philippines. This is meant to make Maria Ressa a symbol and a rallying point for the political Opposition in its time of dire need as Filipinos have shown they’re past the point where they would consider voting for the “icons” of “freedom and democracy” which the combined liberals and leftist-liberal-militants stand for. Nothing can change the fact though, that in the grand scheme of things, Maria Ressa is nothing but a pawn. She is just a piece on the geopolitical chessboard.",Others
Rappler republishes and amplifies malicious FAKE NEWS published by PhilSTAR,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/rappler-republishes-and-amplifies-malicious-fake-news-published-by-philstar/,"A “news story” authored by “reporter” Elijah Felice Rosales was put out by the Philippine Star yesterday on its front page practically screaming as “fact” that the Department of Finance hired a “fake Facebook account operator”. Then Rappler picked it up and amplified it on social media linking to its own version of said “news” in a piece written by “reporter” Gelo Gonzales titled “DOF hires Nic Gabunada, operator of fake network on Facebook – report”. Note the tail-end of the title “– report” used by Rappler. It is short for declaring that they are quoting a “report” in their own “report”. This is an example of dishonest journalism begetting dishonest journalism!
It isn’t normal practice among news outlets to pick up each other’s stories much more headline stories but, in this case, Rappler probably thought this was too good to pass up specially if they don’t have a reporter covering the Department of Finance (DOF) beat.
The contract awarded to Gabunada wasn’t anomalous. The DOF has a rigorous procurement policy which requires all bidders to register with the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGeps). It also makes sure that each bidder has their documentary requirements, specially with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), in order. This is true for both individuals and corporations. The only fact in the story was the page takedowns. Every social media operator knows that at that time, Facebook didn’t have a page transparency policy. One could be made an admin of a page without knowing it unlike now when a request is sent to the individual and the latter has the option of accepting or declining.
It is evident that Rappler‘s and the Philippine Star‘s purpose was to rile the public again about trolls. The reality is both sides of the political fence have trolls working for them. If you want to look at it from a broader perspective, the individuals who are politically active on social media are also trolls by definition. What sets apart trolls are those who are paid and unpaid.
It’s a fact that the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) under Martin Andanar has fallen short of its mandate. Five years into the administration, the state-owned communications machinery is nowhere near where he promised it would be close to, which is the BBC. The administration has had to contend with a well-organized black propaganda campaign here and abroad. This is not the first time the Star ran a malicious story. Previously, Prinz Magtulis’s story about anomalous China loans to the Philippines was rebutted by no less than DOF Secretary Carlos Dominguez in a letter to the editor. The Star took down the story because it wasn’t based on mere speculation and innuendo. Dominguez has taken pains in the transparency initiative of his department because it is the clearinghouse for revenues and expenditures and is at the forefront of the country’s economic strategy and policy.
It now appears that the basic tenets of journalism about facts and objectivity have been thrown out the window. Facebook is publicly-held company with an end-user agreement. In this particular instance, according to the Star and Rappler, Gabunada was tried and found guilty by a private entity and not a court of law. Given Facebook has billions of users worldwide, the basis for being dooms to be in violation of community standards is largely dependent on an AI algorithm that works off parameters defined by Facebook as well.
It has become common journalistic practice these days to spin news stories to fit a narrative being sold to the public. Lat week, Sen. Panfilo Lacson claimed an Undersecretary in one of the departments was forming a troll army against opposition candidates for 2022. Lacson didn’t offer any proof. Yesterday, it was Senator Tito Sotto’s turn. He made a public statement about Facebook shutting down troll accounts in the Philippines for the duration of the election cycle. Social media platforms have given individuals the opportunity to make their sentiments about issues known. Is it democratic to immediately label people who do so as trolls? The best example of inconsistency is Maria Ressa. Rappler started out in 2012 as a “social news network”. That was Ressa’s description of what was then a startup media channel. It had since gained popularity or notoriety, depending on which side you’re on, during the impeachment trial of the late former Chief Justice Renato Corona. The result was Ressa’s libel conviction from a case filed by Wilfredo Keng.
Ressa was very much an advocate of social media first before she turned around and described it as evil. It was also she who pioneered in fact-checking. This had other media outlets questioning who died and made her Queen of Philippine media? Rappler has now deteriorated to the level of a propaganda mouthpiece for the Opposition. The Star, for its part, is controlled by Manny Pangilinan, an oligarch who is not a fan of President Rodrigo Duterte given his woes with PLDT-Smart and Maynilad under his administration. If this is the new standard of journalism in the country, doesn’t the government have the option to get its message across to counter propaganda with facts?
Secretary Dominguez is caught between a rock and a hard place because when the President needs money, he turns to him. At the same time, it’s also his job to raise money either through tax collection or borrowings or both. Businessmen were wary of a Duterte Presidency because of his lack of knowledge about the economy. Duterte was humble enough to admit wala akong alam diyan. But he was also wise enough to give the economic portfolio to Secretary Dominguez.
It is no wonder then that media is not winning any public support because of their obvious bias against the administration. It has been over a year since the closure of ABS-CBN due to the expiration of its franchise and Congress voting not to grant it a new one but there has been no revolution and no suppression of the freedom of expression or press freedom for that matter. What does it say of Rappler when it is also the first to violate the tenets of journalism? Simply that Maria Ressa is a hypocritical hack who is being funded by vested interest groups here and abroad.",Others
"Go woke, go broke: ABS-CBN succumbs to cancel culture – breaks ties with CNTV",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/go-woke-go-broke-abs-cbn-succumbs-to-cancel-culture-breaks-ties-with-cntv/,"Amid “heavy” social media “backlash” mostly from Yellowtards (the bloc within the Philippine Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan), top Philippine media network ABS-CBN has reportedly “ended its partnership with Chinatown News TV (CNTV) and will no longer air the Mandarin-language newscast.” As expected, Yellowtard Netizens and “thought leaders” are now busy patting themselves on the back for showing Big Corporate Network who’s boss.
One wonders though if ABS-CBN is in good enough financial shape to go as “woke” as its chi chi audience would like it to go. It has lost a significant chunk of its ad revenue base when its franchise to broadcast expired and was not renewed by Congress last year and its shares are trading at less than half the value of what it averaged over 2019 and the first half of 2020. Its nearest competitor, GMA Network Inc seems to have benefited from ABS-CBN’s troubles reportedly enjoying a 79 percent profitability surge while ABS-CBN suffered a 65.5 percent drop in ad revenue in late 2020.
GMA acknowledged that it benefited from an increase in advertising sales after ABS-CBN’s free-to-air broadcasts were shut down last May 5.
“The closure of biggest rival, ABS-CBN, due to the expiration of their broadcast franchise last May 5 and the subsequent denial last July 10 by the House Committee on Legislative Franchises of ABS-CBN’s new application also contributed to the increase in sales due to the shift in some advertising placements,” GMA said.
Broadcasting Chinese-language content will likely have contributed a bit of a boost to its fortunes on account of the additional audience base Chinese News TV (CNTV) would have brought to ABS-CBN had the deal with CNTV owner Horizon of the Sun Communications, Incorporated pushed through. However, it seems that ABS-CBN executive management bow more to the shrill cancellations of its “woke” fans than the plight of its shareholders who watch helplessly as their investment in the network evaporates.
Particularly disturbing is how little foresight ABS-CBN executive management have so far exhibited. They seem to have not done their homework and taken into account the prevailing political tensions with China that Opposition partisans, “activists”, and “thought leaders” have been drumming up as part of their vilification campaign against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. One would have expected ABS-CBN management to consider that they had relied heavily on Opposition partisans rallying behind their efforts to lobby Congress into renewing their franchise last year. More notable is how quickly ABS-CBN had backpedalled after feeling the wrath of wokedom’s cancel culture.
As expected, the Yellowtards and communists are celebrating this as a triumph of “principle” over profit tipping an empty hat to ABS-CBN doing “the right thing”. Then again, “principles” aren’t a line item in ABS-CBN’s balance sheets and it is unlikely that its CEO Carlo Katigbak will be anywhere near assuring his bosses in the Board that the people they represent will be laughing all the way to the bank every month like they did in the good old days.",Others
Only stupid people watch Pinoy Big Brother,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/only-stupid-people-watch-pinoy-big-brother/,"It’s curious how, on one hand, the wokedom of ABS-CBN supporters and fandoms get all their panties twisted over toxicity and “gaslighting” and, on another, are all agush over the artificial goings-on in a reality TV show like Pinoy Big Brother.
PBB is cheap entertainment. It suckers young people who are starved for attention into acting like idiots in front of TV cameras to pique the voyeuristic impulses of the morons who tune in. There is no talent input into the show — only animals out for blood. It is the equivalent of a human sabong (cockfight). The human participants in this televised psychological bloodsport are primed for battle by their respective howling fans and placed in an environment conducive to eliciting the reptilian impulses that make for a good show.
PBB is also a cheap factory for lucrative Kapamilya celebrities. Counted amongst its products are famous personalities like Bianca Gonzalez and Kim Chiu. Both are indentured to ABS CBN to the tune of millions of pesos which means the corporation makes even more money off “talent” incubated in the PBB house. Despite the millions they are paid, these celebs seem to feel that they owe their whole being to the Corporation seeing how they used their personal brands (at great cost to their respective sanities) to campaign for the renewal of their employers’ franchise to broadcast.
The short of it is that while audiences get off on celebrity bad behaviour on PBB, the crooks at ABS-CBN laugh all the way to the bank. Indeed, the forced isolation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is perfect for crooked programming like PBB. The show alone is testament to the hypocrisy of “activists” who put ABS-CBN on a holy pedestal and sing praises about how this corporation aims to be “in the service of the Filipino people”. The truth is, whatever “public service” ABS-CBN pretends to deliver to Filipinos is funded by the dishonest cash generated by shows like PBB.
Evidently, the business of broadcasting trash like PBB is a brilliant business model. The show virtually sells itself. On social media, one or another “influencer” issue commentary on events going on in the PBB “household” to signal virtue. Footage of an incident involving participant Justin Dizon treating fellow “housemate” Jie-Ann Armero, badly, for example, went viral as an outrage fad on social media and generated a lot of idiotic chatter. Much of this chatter was marked by social media personalities expressing outrage over Dizon’s behaviour. Not surprisingly, Dizon had, as of this writing, been “evicted” from the household after being voted out in the digital polls that are part of the PBB operating rhythm. This would most likely fuel even more online chatter as the usual who’s-who of virtue-signalling “wokes” exchange digital high-fives over social media.
Recall the rhetorical question issued by the famous Jedi warrior Obi Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guinness): Who’s the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? Consider that much could be said about the crooked intent of reality TV shows like Pinoy Big Brother. Then consider how even more could be said of the idiots who watch it.",Others
How the comms team of President Noynoy Aquino used Facebook for its own DISHONEST propaganda,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/how-the-comms-team-of-president-noynoy-aquino-used-facebook-for-its-own-dishonest-propaganda/,"Nowadays, the Philippine Opposition led by the bloc within it rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan incessantly beat the drum about “pro-administration trolls” who are part of a government conspiracy to propagate “fake news” and, of course, “silence dissent”. The “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards would like Filipinos to believe that the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte hold a monopoly over this sort of thing. However, just a quick look to the not-so-distant past reveals a profoundly industrialised dishonesty the Yellowtards applied to state communications when they were in power.
In a 2011 Manila Standard piece, The impromptu war, the late Jojo Robles offers us a glimpse into then President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III’s Malacanang social media war room as it mounted a frantic but futile defense against a barrage of inquiries being fielded by administration critics over social media channels like Facebook and Twitter during the much-hyped appearance of President Aquino on the YouTube video series World View…
The top Internet propaganda strategist of Malacanang was in a foul-mouthed, hair-pulling rage. For an entire day last week, he and his army of paid Facebook page “administrators” and commenters were working as hard as they could, deleting critical posts and attempting to bury them under an avalanche of pro-government declarations and small talk.
And yet, for all their efforts, the critical questions and the occasional heckling would not be stopped. How was this possible, especially on this day, when the President was supposed to be answering sanitized questions softly thrown by a Google executive who had no idea at all of what was going on in the Philippines?
It is evident that silencing dissent was something the Yellowtards themselves were not above. In fact, as Robles shows, they clearly used state resources to do just that under the Aquino government. It gets worse, however. The story of dishonest media manipulation perpetrated by the Yellowtards goes even further back. This is the same mob of crooked people who allegedly hijacked the original Noynoy Aquino Facebook fan page (BSA3) set up by Califorinia-based Ben Totanes and Betty Abrantes in 2009.
Totanes and Abrantes set up the ill-fated Facebook “fan page” of President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, BSA3 at Facebook.com/Noynoy.Aquino to gather support to push for a rallying behind Noynoy’s candidacy shortly after the death of his mother former President Corazon Aquino in August 2009. They were then enlisted by Vicente Romano III head of Aquino’s New Media Bureau (and whose claim to fame also comes from being one of the pioneers of on-line petition campaigns in Philippine politics after mounting such an effort against then President Joseph Estrada in 2000) into the campaign.
After amassing more than 1.5 million fans by the time Noynoy was sworn in as President in June of 2010, Abrantes and Totanes found out the hard way what sorts of consequences dealing with crooks yield.
Reported GMA News TV…
[…] after the election, Romano allegedly recommended that the fan page be shut down. Instead, Totanes and Abrantes offered to turn over administration of the page to the then newly-formed Presidential Communications Group on the condition that comments critical of the administration would not be removed.
“Sinabi ko sa kanila na pwede pa rin nila gamitin ito, ngunit dapat pamalagiin itong ‘Feedback Forum’ ng sambayanang Pilipino, at huwag tatanggalin ang mga comments — ‘pro or anti’ ng mga tao,” he said.
(I told them that they can still use the fan page, as long as it’s maintained as a venue for feedback from the Filipino people. No comments must be removed, be they negative or positive.)
Coloma allegedly disagreed with Totanes’ conditions, and decided to set up a new official fan page, PresidentNoy at Facebook.com/PresidentNoy, in August this year.
And then…
On November 9, Totanes received an email directly from Facebook administrators saying that the BSA3 fan page “has been removed for violating (Facebook’s) Terms of Use.”
An official statement from Malacanang issued by then Presidential Communications Group head Sec. Herminio Coloma declined to comment on whether Malacanang had a hand in the sudden closure of the original BSA3 page. According to AllFacebook.com (functional at the time), the number of “likes” on the fan page of the new PresidentNoy Facebook page suddenly jumped in number from about 100,000 as of the 8th of November to almost 1.6 million as of the 11th of November of that year.
All the posturing of today’s Yellowtard-led Opposition only shows that it takes one to know one. They are the first to take great pains to manipulate social media messaging, use state resources to intervene in public discourse, and suppress dissenting points of view. More importantly, it reveals just how dishonest they are, even to their own supporters. The Yellowtards are hypocrites, plain and simple. Filipinos should be extra vigilant and acquire the habit of lending a critical eye to anything they say. They should educate themselves with facts, both historical and present to equip them to make informed decisions on things of national consequence.",Others
On lone dependence on memes as protest tools,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/on-lone-dependence-on-memes-as-protest-tools/,"There was a time when protests were done knowing well enough that such actions could cost your life or a stint in prison. Whether it was on the streets, or publishing or airing subversive materials, people were prepared for any possibility of harm that may come their way for pushing whatever vision or reforms they advocated.
They also wrote and articulated their visions for society. Lengthy treatises, essays, and journals presented a precise picture of what these people wanted to accomplish and most, if not all of the time, pushed for inclusiveness and the deliberate stance of convincing people to join their cause and subsequently increase their numbers and influence.
In 2020, there’s a pronounced difference in the way clashing ideas are presented to the world. Thanks in no small part to the democratization of access to information and technology. Suddenly the tools available to only a small fraction of people before—a platform with an audience, publishing capability, video production—are now in the hands of the average person. And this presented a tricky scenario as far as exchanges of ideas between opposing camps are concerned.
These days, anyone with a mobile device and access to an internet connection can contribute to discussions about everything. Of course, as far as discussions go, politics and social issues are perpetually on top of the preferred topics. And this is the digital era where information is presented in a myriad of different platforms, and near-infinite sources of said messages.
While the advent of social media was hailed as a great equalizer in terms of wresting the controls from the kind of narrative traditional media wanted to impose, its downside was in sifting through tons of noise, shady, and downright malicious and false information. With the latter being exploited to the hilt by traditional media as sources of “fake news”.
And since digital content is so easy to generate and share across numerous avenues, people became lazy in producing original materials and have been dependent on just sharing other people’s outputs and ideas to express themselves. Aside from opinion pieces and blogs/vlogs—still the best methods in articulating one’s thoughts—the most popular mode of expression these days are through memes. The latest incarnation of protest through humor against a perceived enemy. Simple, straightforward, and easily recognizable.
Nothing wrong with sharing memes, because they serve a function as outlets to humor and witty discussions. But solely depending on these things as the only ways to present your stand on any divisive issue is, while valid, ultimately counterproductive and a dead-end when it comes to your desired outcome.
Like effigies and parodies, memes are direct and uncompromising in their attack. And like the other tools that preceded it, should be treated as a supplementary aid rather than a primary mode of expression. The total dependence to it presents a one dimensional portrait of the sharer, which is simply opposing for opposing’s sake, or the opposite. No other insight or rational explanation behind it, just a constant attack. No answer as to why the person thinks that way about something . And there’s no chance (no matter how small) to entice someone with an opposing view to take a step back and ponder on the valid points of the opposite spectrum. As mentioned before, it’s a dead end.
Well and good if your only goal is to irritate and provoke your Facebook and Twitter contacts on the opposite side of the fence until you get muted or blocked. Mission accomplished in that aspect. But as far as opening a discussion to present a stand in a sober and coherent light, it leaves a lot to be desired. Which is a pity, because people tend to learn more on ideas in direct opposition to theirs than from someone with the same opinion.

Should Twitter and Facebook block Donald Trump?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/should-twitter-and-facebook-block-donald-trump/,"That question needs to be answered within the context of whether or not people who continue to listen to outgoing United States president Donald Trump and even heed his public calls actually have a collective grievance that needs to be responded to. As it stands, it is likely that blocking Trump would be the equivalent of putting a lid on a cauldron that is boiling over. What is more important to consider is what to do about the fire underneath that cauldron.
Is Trump the fire that brought many Americans to a boiling point today? Or was that fire burning long before Trump even considered the American presidency back in the lead up to the 2016 presidential elections? This is the real question Americans need to answer.
Like it or not, social media was the new battlefield for competing ideas. It was a place where the best communicators and most wily influencers win. Like it or not, it was also a place where the human condition was being put to the test — specifically the test of whether our individual cognitive faculties were up to the task of evaluating these competing ideas in a Darwinian landscape far purer than the old order of news cycles and bureaucratic “editorial oversight” that the Internet had made utterly obsolete.
That our intellect was seen to have failed on the earlier — the social media landscape — is now largely a given. However what is not highlighted as much is the fact that our intellects hadn’t seen any proud moments over media landscapes that preceded social media either. Think traditional print media and radio broadcast media, the earlier with its multi-thousand year history and the latter with its just over a hundred year history. These were landscapes where ideas ascended to dominance on the back of interests that controlled the technologies of the time — printing presses and radio transmitters — and the organisations that cleverly employed these technologies — publishing houses, organised religion, advertising and marketing agencies and broadcast networks.
Imagine then, the book burnings instigated by one organised religion or the other over centuries, or the race to monopolise the airwaves perpetrated by media barons in the last 100 years in various countries. An outrage by today’s standards, right? So how then is Twitter and Facebook, now acting as both owners of information dissemination technology and infrastructure and authorities on what information or ideas should be allowed to propagate over these assets any different from, say, the Inquisition, or, in latter times, the BBC in the United Kingdom, Pravda in the former Soviet Union?
It seems the real issue here is whether those parties who seek to sustain a prescribed type of thinking over what had become the Establishment media landscape (today’s Big Tech social media platforms) had done a good job of making their ideas competitive over the free market of ideas. If their ideas failed to compete in that free market, is tilting the market to the disadvantage of the competition the right way to go? Americans, of all people, would not take kindly to such a prospect.
In any case, social media is just a class of applications that is running on the Internet. This is an important point to make. Social media “platforms” such as Twitter and Facebook are not the Internet. That’s not to say these and their peers have not been trying to be the Internet. That’s not different from the Inquisition trying to be the standard of human thinking or Pravda employing state resources to enforce its being the only source of news in the now-defunct Soviet Union.
If people lose confidence in the notion that Twitter and Facebook are level playing fields for competing ideas to be exchanged, they will go elsewhere just as people who realised that churches and mosques were not really places where different points of view could be discussed safely voted with their feet. It may take time, but it will happen. In an age where change moves a lot faster and companies rise and fall within just a year or two, perhaps sooner rather than later. Other applications and “platforms” will be built on the Internet where the competition will continue. Maybe a new Internet altogether will be built as was the premise of the hit HBO series Silicon Valley.
So should outgoing President Donald Trump be banned on Twitter and Facebook? The answer to that question depends on what Americans really want to achieve. Is it to “fix” the inconvenience of a certain “undesirable” demographic or ethnic group being able to express their “politically-incorrect” points of view? Or is it because of a genuine aspiration to make the world a safer place for diverse ideas and points of view to be exchanged? Here’s another more acute one to consider:

The demise of ABS-CBN will herald a mass media renaissance in the Philippines!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/the-demise-of-abs-cbn-will-herald-a-mass-media-renaissance-in-the-philippines/,"If the community of content producers, artists, and creative types would care to pause a bit and step out of the herd mentality that is the lunacy of their “solidarity” with embattled ABS-CBN, they will see the vast opportunities that await their craft with the demise of the Philippines’ biggest mass media empire. For so long, ABS-CBN has loomed over the Philippines’ entertainment industry as an enormous reservoir of degenerate content that all but drowned out small independent producers that would have invigorated and substantially enriched Philippine entertainment had they been given access to a level playing field.
It is baffling the way the artists’ community are rallying behind ABS-CBN. For decades, ABS-CBN served as a major roadblock to injections of fresh blood into mass media entertainment. It had made use of uncompetitive practices to prop up its bankable but utterly mediocre talent and used its connections with an entrenched political-industrial complex to maintain its monopolistic hold. By flooding the market with a steady supply of cheap entertainment products, ABS-CBN kept downstream media distributors and theatre chains fat and complacent and unwilling to give space to smaller independent artists and producers.
If anything, freelance and independent artists and performers should be celebrating the disappearance of a major hurdle to the Philippines’ long overdue creative renaissance. Without the market flooded with the slapstick humour of Vice Ganda, the brain-dead bleached girlshows of Kim Chiu and Coco Martin, and the template plots of the McMovies churned out by Star Cinema, Philippine mass entertainment stands a chance of developing into the smarter, edgier, and more sophisticated scene of the sort that could compete with the international-grade products of Korea and China.
The Philippines’ creative scene is literally having the life of it sucked out by big corporate media outfits like ABS-CBN. For the likes of ABS-CBN, entertainment is manufactured rather than created. It regards sees art a business rather than a craft and aims to make the most money from the lowest common denominator. If there is one thing that is holding back the Philippines from taking its place amongst the world’s great outlets for talent in the performing arts, ABS-CBN would be it.
Rather than be all crybaby about the demise of an agent of creative degeneracy, independent Filipino artists and producers should be stepping up and gearing up to compete and fill the void left behind by the Kapamilya mob. It’s time Filipino artists compete on the international scene rather than compete with an unbeatable monopoly that is kept profitable using dishonest business practices that had long been eradicated from the entertainment industries of the worlds greatest entertainment capitals.
The Philippines’ mass entertainment and broadcast industry is facing the dawn of a new era as the sun sets — no, crashes down — on ABS-CBN. This new era should be embraced and not feared. To fear it only means that ABS-CBN continues to win in the effort tilt the market and ensure itself continued access to the cornered market it grew fat on over the last several decades.",Others
Life goes on and GETS BETTER without #ABSCBN news and entertainment,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/life-goes-on-and-gets-better-without-abscbn-news-and-entertainment/,"Filipinos should get a grip. It is actually possible to live without ABS-CBN. It’s been proven. Many chi chi Ateneans and other private school kids who form part of ABS-CBN executive management very likely lead entire lives not watching a single one of the “entertainment” products their own company subjects Filipinos to. Indeed, an interesting question one could ask ABS-CBN president Carlo Katigbak who is a graduate of chi chi Xavier School and the Ateneo de Manila University is whether he subjects his own kids to the trashy programmes ABS-CBN airs.
All this makes interesting the notion that ABS-CBN is as essential to Filipino lives as rice. Could it be that ABS-CBN programming is the pagpag of the media industry in this regard?
Perhaps so. Business taipans who themselves don’t eat the food their businesses serve to their customers are in a class of their own. Much like the way that other Yellowtard business Ligo Sardines sells canned fish to poor Filipinos, ABS-CBN sells canned laughter and drama to the same market. The difference between the two is that while most people can tell that a slab of grilled salmon tastes way better than the oily muck that slips out of a can of Ligo, what makes Parasite way better than one of those Angelica Panganiban movies very likely flies above the average Filipino film buff’s head. In that sense, ABS-CBN is worse than Ligo Sardines. Poverty and substandard education ensures Filipinos cannot tell just how bad ABS-CBN products are. The company rakes in enormous profits off that dishonest trade on the back of mass ignorance.
That’s not to say, of course, that depriving Filipinos of Pinoy Big Brother will turn them into big fans of the Discovery Channel anytime soon. There’s a bigger shift in culture and thinking that goes into changing that and, beyond ABS-CBN, there are other possibly even more powerful agents of intellectual degeneration that remain deeply-entrenched in Philippine society. There’s the GMA Network and its Eat Bulaga fandom and, yes, the Roman Catholic Church and its Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) Gestapo among others. Those two big agents of kaboboan are not about to be wiped off the face of the planet anytime soon so, back to the matter of ABS-CBN blinking out, there still is room for important perspective.
No less than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates himself attests to the massive productivity and self-improvement boost abstaining from watching TV delivers…
I stopped listening to music and watching TV in my 20s. It sounds extreme, but I did it because I thought they would just distract me from thinking about software.
That’s just TV in general. Imagine then if people are cut off from trashy TV. This is the gift that the ABS-CBN shutdown will keep giving Filipinos henceforth. Filipinos are not going to turn into software innovators overnight but the removal of a media organisation that shovels crap into everyone’s living rooms and devices and earns buckets of money off that dishonest business is, indeed, a development they should welcome with a lot of fanfare.
The fact is, there is an elite minority of Filipinos who lead entire lives not consuming a single ABS-CBN product. These are people who, more often than not, lead richer more productive lives and are likely to breed offspring who carry on their productivity and wealth. There is certainly nothing wrong with that and there’s everything right about the demise of ABS-CBN.",Others
Rule of Law prevails over politics as ABS-CBN goes off air,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/rule-of-law-prevails-over-politics-as-abs-cbn-goes-off-air/,"It’s almost unreal. According to a breaking Manila Bulletin report, ABS-CBN has signed off and has gone off air in compliance to a cease and desist order from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) after the network’s license to broadcast expired yesterday. It was lights out following its final TV Patrol broadcast.
Opposition groups were, as expected, quick to denounce this development as (what else?) an “attack on press freedom”. “Social news network” Rappler issued its usual slanted reporting on the subject suggesting that ABS-CBN was essential to the dissemination of important information related to the raging COVID-19 pandemic…
Media organizations also questioned the “untimely” decision and urged the government to keep ABS-CBN open, as Filipinos need updates about the coronavirus pandemic.
…perhaps selectively forgetting that there are many other media organisations and “thought leaders”, not to mention the state broadcasting agency itself, already providing ample reliable information on the subject. Is ABS-CBN News “reporting” really that special as to be regarded as a big fat pillar of the country’s information infrastructure as Rappler “reporter” Ralf Rivas makes it out to be? Many Filipinos would beg to differ.
One would be hard-pressed to put up a eulogy to ABS-CBN painting it as a paragon of virtue. It makes most of its money off low quality unoriginal entertainment programs that have long known to contribute to the intellectual bankruptcy of Philippine society. The late Supreme Court Justice Isagani Cruz referred to the entertainment industry within which ABS-CBN skimmed off the lion’s share of profit as a “wasteland” in an Inquirer editorial dated the 16th June 2006…
The Philippine entertainment industry is not only a vast wasteland, as television has been described in America, but a vicious instrument for the abatement of the nation’s intelligence. The shows it offers for the supposed recreation of the people are generally vulgar and smutty, usually with some little moral lesson inserted to make them look respectable, but offensive nonetheless. On the whole, they are obnoxious and unwholesome and deserve to be trashed.
Indeed, the industry deserves to be trashed. The shuttering of ABS-CBN in a sense fulfills a long overdue need for a hard reckoning. Philippine media would have been in an excellent and unique position of power to influence Filipino thinking by uplifting it to a level befitting that of a true 21st Century society. One would expect the exceptional power wielded by an enormous corporation like ABS-CBN to be used to strengthen independent thought and eradicate the comfy poverty of originality so deeply-burnt into the fibres that weave the very fabric of Philippine society.
Suffice to say, ABS CBN did not step up to that role it had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fill.
To be fair, like any other for-profit private enterprise, the management of ABS-CBN owes its loyalty wholly to its shareholders. This was made clearly evident in the lengths its management took to circumvent the law, even going as far as engaging the “services” of the Philippine Senate itself tapping the influence of one of its shareholders there, Senator Grace Poe, to lead a dishonest “senate inquiry” into the matter of its fate. This despite the obvious conflicts of interest considering that a web of family ties and relationships past and present form a matrix of interconnection between Poe and the embattled media conglomerate. Indeed, ABS-CBN is not just a broadcast and media network, it is a political network in and of itself.
Taking all these facts about ABS-CBN into consideration, any suggestion that the corporation is some sort of Messiah figure to the Filipino people and, as such, a “victim” of some imagined government crucifixion comes from the hopelessly addled minds of so-called “thought leaders” whose thinking hadn’t evolved much since the 1980s.
What is it exactly that Filipinos are losing if ABS-CBN goes dark forever? People should think about the answer to this question using clear heads not bent to the perverse narrative of partisans who remain rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards). What Filipinos are actually gaining from the closure of ABS-CBN is an opportunity to quit mediocre and unoriginal entertainment products cold turkey. More importantly, they will see a newly-leveled playing field in the important practice of broadcast news.
The future looks bright and Filipinos should embrace this change and the chance to build new and better things now that ABS-CBN no longer stands in the way of innovation in Philippine mass media",Others
Pinky Webb was forcing Malacanang spox Harry Roque to answer Danny Arao’s “challenge”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/pinky-webb-was-forcing-malacanang-spox-harry-roque-to-answer-danny-araos-challenge/,"The latest flypaper “issue” currently keeping Yellowtards’ mouths flapping is a video featuring a spat between CNN tele-“journalist” Pinky Webb and Malacanang spokesman Harry Roque who she was interviewing. Webb was eliciting a reaction from Roque to a tweet fielded by University of the Philippines (UP) “journalism” professor Danilo Arao where he issues a challenge to all “top-level officials” of the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to “denounce” the junking by the Department of National Defense (DND) of a 1989 “accord” with the UP banning the Philippine military from its campuses.
Evidently, Arao’s challenge is a cleverly-worded coercion that really does not merit a serious response to begin with as it already carries with it an inherent presumption that anyone responding to it with a refusal to “denounce” the DND would lack “honor and excellence”. But that is exactly what Webb was demanding that Roque do.
At 10:22 of the above video, Webb, after reading Arao’s tweet out loud, asks Roque, “Let me ask you, sir, are you denouncing this letter by [DND] Secretary [Delfin] Lorenzana as a [former] UP student and as a former UP professor? Are you denouncing it?”. Roque responded saying “I am asking the DND secretary and the president of  UP to sit down and I’ve offered my good offices to facilitate this meeting…”.
Roque, evidently did not answer Webb’s question. But then who is Arao anyway that would compel the presidential spokesman to answer what is clearly a dishonest question — one that Webb personally asked Roque herself? Recall that Webb started her question with “Let me ask you sir” (emphasis of the word “me” is mine). After a commercial break, Roque proceeded to assert that he was under no obligation to make a personal statement — much more a “denunciation” — under pressure from anyone, not from Webb and certainly not from Arao.
Webb clarified saying that “it was a tweet that I read and I asked for your reaction if you would denounce it”. Clearly Pinky Webb lies here. She earlier personally asked Roque the same question Arao asked. She did not request Roque’s reaction to Arao’s tweet. She personally relayed Arao’s dishonest question to the presidential spokesman. Roque rightly calls out Webb, “you wanted me to answer Danny Arao,” and he asks her “Why should I?”
Webb was clearly caught lying to Harry Roque, spokesman of the Philippine President, on national television. She took editorial liberties by going beyond quoting the tweet of some two-bit “journalism” professor and owned the question she asked Roque but later, when taken to task for running with what was clearly a dishonest question, lied in saying that she merely sought to request Roque’s reaction to said tweet.
Dishonest journalism.
Next time we wonder why Big Corporate Media had lost all credibility and are no longer seen to be bastions of truth and fairness, right here is a brilliant case in point. We have Pinky Webb and her dishonesty to thank for this excellent insight into the depths to which broadcast news have sunk.",Others
Facebook news outage won’t affect people looking for REAL info,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/facebook-news-outage-wont-affect-people-looking-for-real-info/,"By now, most would be aware of the storm kicked up by Facebook’s botched attempt to face off with the Australian Government. As Google began efforts to find middle ground in light of Australia following through on legislation that will require social media platforms to pay for exhibiting news content on its users’ feeds, Facebook jumped the gun and switched off access to a large swathe of content that could be viewed and shared on its platform. While the intent was to continue playing chicken with the Aussies’ news media payment legislation, Facebook inadvertently roped in non-news content — including vital government public service sites — to its blackout zones.
Ironic that the term “news feed” was most — if not originally — associated with Facebook which pioneered the concept back in the early- to mid-2000s. Now it’s taken out the “news” from its feed and many other governments are now watching with interest what happens next. It does not help too that Facebook arch-rival Twitter got itself into a pickle after banning then-sitting US President Donald Trump from its site recently triggering alarm in many European countries where legislation curbing the increasingly disturbing power of Big Corporate Social Media is gaining traction.
But do people still use Facebook to keep track of the latest content coming from mainstream news media? The trouble with Facebook’s feed is that content does not come out as they are published. What is served to our eyeballs is the outcome of “curation” done by its now-infamous algorithm that decides on the basis of what content will most likely keep us scrolling for more.
As Facebook progressively automated more and more of its prioritisation regime, users became less and less conscious of how they were influencing this algorithm, and Facebook, became more and more presumptuous about what its users “wanted” to see. The algorithm relied less on users consciously telling it what to post more or less of and, instead, inferred these wishes from less conscious and less deliberate behaviour. We now call this unconscious behaviour “user engagement”. The methods and tools used for inferring user preferences and predicting user behaviour based on “user engagement” data is a lucrative endeavour in the field now known as “analytics”. From there, the rest is history.
Most users of Twitter will have likely seen a similar algorithm that tailors how content appears based on what it “learns” about our preferences implemented on that platform as well. Fortunately, Twitter allows its users to revert to the original feed that displays tweets in chronological order as they are posted by users we follow. This is likely why Twitter had come to be preferred over Facebook by users who are serious followers of mainstream news.
Between Google and Facebook, a block on news sites implemented by the earlier would have been more disastrous to Aussies. Google, after all, is unmatched in its ability to serve relevant content to its users and most researchers rely on Google to find information from reliable resources. Facebook, on the other hand, is a “fun” site and consumption of its content is done far more passively than, say, on Google whose users actively search. And, perhaps, compounded by its opaque algorithm which makes what comes out on its feeds unpredictable, most Facebook users likely take what content they get out of it with a grain of salt.
Indeed, Facebook needs to tread carefully too when it comes to its Philippine operations. Its platform is given considerable preference by carriers such as Philippine telco giant Globe Telecoms (which is partially owned by giant Singaporean telco SingTel). Most Filipinos spend almost all of their Internet activities within the Facebook platform thanks to Filipino carriers such as Globe excluding much of the data accessed by Filipino users that originates from Facebook from data charges. Because Facebook data is free, most Filipinos’ online activities tend to be disproportionately confined to Facebook. Facebook is effectively The Internet for most Filipinos.
That essentially makes Facebook an entity of particular interest to Philippine regulators as well. It exerts disturbingly disproportionate control over Filipino citizens’ Internet activities and, even more importantly, their access to it. Its arrangement with carriers can even be regarded as collusive in nature. Carriers are a public utility and should be transmitting data and content without prejudice towards any one or other content producer or digital service. This arrangement with Facebook runs counter to such principles. This is another aspect of its operations in the Philippines that should be raising regulators’ eyebrows.
Coming back to its tiff with the Aussie Government, it is really Facebook that is the subject of this interesting experiment and people are watching what its users do next. Is it really that important a platform to news media and other publishers of serious content? If the answer to that is a “no”, then there is cause for other governments to start to consider taking bolder steps to cut the social media behemoth down to size.",Others
Opposition to campaign on a Revenge Platform for the 2022 elections following ABS-CBN shutdown,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/opposition-to-campaign-on-a-revenge-platform-for-the-2022-elections-following-abs-cbn-shutdown/,"Not to be outdone following the denied renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise to broadcast on Friday, the Opposition have now set their sights on the 2022 national elections for their “revenge”. Indeed, top Opposition “thought leaders” are now gearing up for the “fight” and crafting a Revenge Platform for that purpose as prominent “activist” Gang Badoy seems to be suggesting in this tweet…
Exciting times indeed. That the Opposition plans to run on a showbiz platform and one fueled by a woke bloodlust to “avenge” ABS-CBN will make for a colourful and lucrative campaign extravaganza in the lead up to 2022. Unfortunately, the now-darkened Yellowtard network will no longer be able to reap the billions of pesos in ad revenue that will be generated by such a circus.
Then again, it is likely that most ordinary Filipinos will have moved on from or even forgotten ABS-CBN by then. Indeed, after a frenzy of “trending” hashtags in the midst of the ABS-CBN brouhaha just yesterday, a quick look at trending topics on Twitter the day after shows how quickly Filipinos turn their attention to other things more relevant to their day-to-day lives after the curtain goes down on such shows.
More importantly, the fact that the Opposition would actually espouse such an intellectually-bankrupt campaign platform as the Revenge Platform upon which former ABS-CBN starlets would run, as Badoy suggests, proves just how singularly-focused the Yellowtards are at seizing power at all costs. They would go as far as encouraging Filipino voters to vote like starstruck ignoramuses just to further their dishonest power-hungry agenda.
Dishonesty heaped upon dishonesty is how the Yellowtard-led Opposition operates. It further highlights how sharp a tool ABS-CBN was in a decades-long effort to keep Filipinos too dazzled by artistas and OA songs and dances to choose wisely come election day. Fortunately the demise of ABS-CBN now presents an opportunity for the national discourse to dial back and rebuild a truly intelligent national debate on a level playing field — without the shadow ABS-CBN had long cast upon the sort of modern conversation that would have normally befit the mature democracy that the Philippines could have been over the last several decades.",Others

A video posted an Instagram shows such people making noise (banging on some sort of metal surface) and lighting candles in what looks like some sort of vigil in front of the network’s head office building.
On Twitter, a who’s-who of celebrities and public personalities wax sentiment over the “demise” of their “beloved” network. Glenda Gloria, “co-founder and managing editor” of “social news” site Rappler issues some words on Twitter despite claiming that there are none such that could be uttered…
The big mystery here is around what exactly these “activists” hope to achieve. Actor and TV host Kim Atienza, for example, can only encourage people on Twitter to make a little noise and pray as ABS-CBN starts to lay off employees.
ABS-CBN News “journalist” Mike Navallo, for his part, seems to suggest in a tweet that vengeance will be forthcoming sometime in the future but stops short of any sort of useful specifics.
Neither Atienza nor Navallo actually offer anything useful to the legions of wailing ABS-CBN fantards.
There really is only one pathway to fixing ABS-CBN’s problems. The biggest clue here is around who or what is in a position to determine whether or not it gets a new franchise to broadcast — none other than Congress. And how do the “right” people get membership in that powerful club? Why, none other way but by winning an election. The solution is therefore quite obvious. The Yellowtards need to win big in the next national elections in 2022. Only then will their “beloved” ABS-CBN get a shot at a new lease on the airwaves.
The Opposition need to re-learn an important democratic skill — winning elections. They won’t acquire that skill by sitting around banging a steel pan, lighting candles on a sidewalk, or praying.",Others
Maria Ressa is indeed a fraud,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/maria-ressa-is-indeed-a-fraud/,"No less than Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly said it. “Ressa is a fraud. Believe me,” Duterte said in a speech last Wednesday. Duterte evidently echoes growing public sentiment over (or, more likely, apathy toward) Rappler CEO Maria Ressa’s incessant positioning of her person and that of her media organisation as hapless “victims” of an imagined government “assault on press freedom”. Indeed, many observers have, on their own, come to the conclusion that this is all just a pile of lies Ressa and her cohorts are heaping before a clueless foreign press that uncritically lap it all up and leave the Philippines copping an unfair bathing in bad light on the world stage.
What does Ressa have to say for herself in response to the Philippines’ enormously popular chief executive? Not much other than deliver even more of the all-too-familiar drivel on Twitter lifted from her worn-out victimhood playbook…
4 years: spewing hate on social media, manipulating Filipinos, weaponizing the law. We call a spade a spade. Was he referring to me? Maybe the President is just seeing too much fraud from where he sits. 🙂   #CourageON #DefendPressFreedom #HoldTheLine
Evidently Ressa hadn’t taken much on board in the way of learnings following a hard-talking she copped from veteran journalist Stephen Sackur on his BBC talk show. “If you are talking about manipulated public opinion,” Sackur asks, then she is, he continues, “de-legitimising” the people’s right to choose their government; that if, as she asserts, their opinions are “fake”, then democracy does not work. Ressa evidently believes that Philippine democracy is broken confirming on record that “democracy is dead” — a claim that is flat out inconsistent with the clear-as-day reality of the Philippines that surrounds her.
Ressa is, indeed, a fraud. This is not just Duterte talking as even his own critics attest to the dishonest nature of Rappler’s brand of crooked journalism as “concerned citizen” Andrew Fornier writes…
I have little patience for the kind of journalism she has represented, in which the reporter is a celebrity of greater importance than the stories she has to tell. There’s a constant undercurrent of arrogance that oozes from the paragraphs of Rappler, particularly from its opinion pieces, which seems content to berate the common citizen for their “ignorance” and proclaim, in all self-righteousness, that there is only one way to look at the news.
Clearly not a fan of the Duterte administration, Fornier bristles over the “boneheaded stupidity of whoever masterminded this farce of a trial” that resulted in the conviction of Ressa for offenses against libel law. Nonetheless, whatever motivated Wilfredo Keng to slap charges against Ressa and her hapless patsy Reynaldo Santos Jr is beside the point as former Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban points out. The law is the law, and it is being dispensed by a functioning judiciary which Ressa sought to and continues to seek to belittle. Indeed, such was the arrogance of Ressa that she refused to dignify the courts with a sensible defense! Panganiban laments, “Ressa and Santos should have testified to defend themselves and to widen the crack in the prosecution’s armor…” Panganiban continues referring to Ressa’s ill-fated legal strategy…
As I have always said, judges decide cases only from the evidence vetted in court, not from street parliaments and media utterances. It is unfair to accuse the judiciary of bias, incompetence, subservience, or corruption for ignoring out-of-court tirades.
Looking back to all that, it seems Duterte was actually being kind when he called Ressa a fraud. Ressa is actually a moron. She was made moronic by her own arrogance.

Umangal ang isang Facebook page sa di magandang paglalarawan sa pamumuno ng naturang bayan ng Rizal, na isa sa pinakamataas ang population density sa bansa:
napakalaki ng impluwensya ng media noong dalawang (2) beses n dumalaw si Maki Pulido, reporter ng GMA 7 sa Montalban at di nya na-imterview si MAYOR TOM HERNANDEZ.
Ang larawang iniwan nya s mga manonood ng 24 Oras ay tila laging wala ang aming mayor.
At hindi po yon totoo kasa-kasama namin si Mayor Tom sa mga pamamahagi ng food assistance sa lahat ng brgy.
Iba talaga ang layunin ng iba sa mga nag-komento sa pangyayaring ito ang makapanakit lang sa taong kanilang gustong siraan.
Sa report ni Maki Pulido sa 24Oras  di malaman kung sinadyang itinuon lang ang halos kabuuan ng report sa galit at hinagpis ng mga mamamayang nakapila para sa ayuda.
Sa maikling bahagi sa dulo ng naturang report lamang kinabit ang paliwanag na sa 97,000 na households na dapat mabigyan ng ayuda, para sa 38,000 na households lamang ang na-release ng National Government.
At dahil nga hindi sinadya ni Pulido ang Mayor ng Rodriguez na si Tom Hernandez upang ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa kanyang bayan, napagmistulang walang ginagawa ang walang ginagawa ang naturang opisyal.
Taliwas ito sa katotohanan kung susuriin ang Facebook page ni Mayor Hernandez kung saan makikita ang halos araw-araw na pagkilos nito upang mahatiran ng ayuda ang mga mamamayan ng Rodriguez.
Hindi ito madaling gawin para sa isang bayan na Rizal kinilalang most densely populated at mayroong 2,439 residents per square kilometer. Bukod diyan, ang bayan na ito ang tumanggap ng halos lahat ng mga informal settlers na ni-resettle mula sa Quezon City sa loob ng mahigit isang dekada.
Kaya hindi malayong nasa Rodriguez din ang isa sa pinakamataas na bilang ng mga households na nangangailangan ng ayuda.
Ang mas delikado pa dito, malamang makalikha ito ng oportunidad upang makapaghikayat ng gulo ang ilang militanteng grupo dahil sa masamang imaheng nilikha ng di-balansadong report ng 24Oras.
Makikita nang tinatadtad na sa Facebook ng sari-saring mura at pang-aalipusta ang Mayor ng Rodriguez, kung saan yung iba dito’y banggit ang masamang pagsasalarawan na katulad ng nasa report ng 24Oras.
Kung makalikha ng gulo ang palyadong pagre-report ng 24Oras, sasagutin ba ng GMA7 ang gastos para sa maaaring masaktan o mamatay?
Maalala natin na sa isang journalist din ng GMA7 na si Arnold Clavio nagmula ang report tungkol sa tambak tambak na patay diumano sa East Avenue Medical Center. Nabato si Clavio ng husto ng kutya mula sa mga netizens kaya napilitang tanggalin ang post niya sa Instagram na nagsilbing mitsa ng galit ng mga taong nagsabing nag-FAKE NEWS si Clavio.
Kung paulit-ulit naman gagawin ni Pulido ang paglimot sa rule of fairness and balance in reporting, baka matulad siya kay Clavio sa mga darating na araw.",Others
Filipinos have so far proven that they do not need ABS-CBN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/filipinos-have-so-far-proven-that-they-do-not-need-abs-cbn/,"It’s been a month since Big Corporate Media network ABS-CBN went off air and life goes on for most Filipinos. For that matter, life goes on under the “new normal” which, as it turns out, is a “normal” that does not include ABS-CBN. Whatever “service” ABS-CBN had supposedly been delivering to Filipinos under the guise of their being “in the service” of said people (their mission statement) turns out to be not essential to life after all. So much for its starlets’ social media tantrums. All that circus really achieved was to further highlight how much ABS-CBN content subtracts from the national intellect with every second that it is allowed to be broadcast by its dishonest producers.
Imagine the damage to the Filipino psyche that could have been avoided had ABS-CBN been kept under the close watch of people whose job it is to nourish the minds of future generations of Filipinos. Instead, an entire Lost Generation lived on a diet of Wowowee, It’s Showtime, and Pinoy Big Brother to grow up to be the celebrity-worshipping hero-addicted hollowheads that went on to dominate an entire national narrative.
Fortunately, Filipinos find themselves at a crossroads. The “plight” of ABS-CBN, specifically the desperation its management exhibited in a scramble to save their corporate hide, had thrown under a harsh light the vacuous — even poisonous — nature of what they had been “serving” the Filipino public all along. A flurry of showbiz appeals to emotion led by their top starlets all but fizzled out after a brief bright blaze. All that is really left is a CEO who, after playing all his flaccid emotional blackmail aces, is now left to face the music of his and his executive team’s failure to mitigate, when they had the opportunity to do so, a risk that had materialised to the colossal corporate crisis we see today.
The only people who are actually reeling from the shutting out of ABS-CBN from broadcasting via public frequencies is its CEO Carlo Katigbak and the shareholders he is directly accountable to. And the Filipino masses who supposedly “needed” ABS-CBN? Perhaps they flinched a bit after being deprived of their daily dose of Kapamilya rubbish. Unfortunately, they have bigger problems to contend with nowadays. The only difference is they will have to face those life challenges without the opiate of escapism that Kim Chiu or Coco Martin shoves down their throats.
Philippine Media — like the Government — cannot be reformed. Why? Simple: the Media industry is made up primarily of privately-owned or publicly-held business enterprises that compete for public attention (just like the Government is made up of politicians competing for essentially the same asset). Yet therein in that last statement lies the solution. For it is in the nature of the public attention that Media giants — and our politicians — compete for that determines the content that they produce. Indeed, Filipinos have it in themselves to bring Philippine Media down to its knees. In this instance, they only need ignore the sad flailings of a once-formidable agent of mass stupidification.
Why cry over ABS-CBN then when it now collapses under the weight of the banality of its own habitual dishonesty? There are more important things to worry about; a “new normal” that is waiting to be embraced and a lot of valuable lessons that one has no choice but to learn coming out of an unprecedented crisis. Sadly, ABS-CBN with all its power and wealth in its heyday did nothing to to equip Filipinos to do any of that.",Others
ABS-CBN inciting “people power” mass protests putting THOUSANDS at risk!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-inciting-people-power-mass-protests-putting-thousands-at-risk/,"What are supporters and former employees of ABS-CBN thinking inciting mass protests over their execs’ failure to secure a franchise renewal? What do they hope to achieve? “People power” rallies are so 1980s. More recent ones failed to move people, what more one that is focused more on the plight of a media network and not much on an issue of national consequence that is relevant to the broader public?
More importantly, all these rallies and noise barrages being organised do nothing but snarl traffic in an already gridlocked metropolis and put hundreds of thousands of people at risk by further fuelling the spread of the COVID-19 virus on account of their gathering in large numbers. This is all thanks to a stubborn habit an Opposition led by rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) continues to apply to its “cause”.
Even more disturbing is how they are emotionally-blackmailing contracted performers of ABS-CBN into joining these protests. Kapamilya starlet Angel Locsin, speaking before a crowd gathered in front of the corporate head office in Quezon City called out what she regards as apathetic colleagues, denouncing how they’d rather glam themselves on Instagram  rather than join their mass action.
On cue, Netizens had started judging celebrities such as Sarah Geronimo just because they are moving on and focusing on making a living in a post-ABS-CBN world.
And to what end?
What next after this circus?
Even now, the Opposition offer no pathway forward within the legal framework to further their dishonest “cause”. They are likely hoping to incite unrest and, very likely, are aiming to topple the Philippine government illegally. After all, the rejection of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal was done observing all legal processes all within the remit of Congressional authority over this matter.
This just means that the next opportunity for ABS-CBN to make its case under a more “favourable” political environment can come only after a victory of the Opposition in the coming 2022 national elections. To achieve that, they will need to win that election, which means mounting a successful campaign on a platform that resonates with the broader Philippine public. Needless to say, they will also need a leader at least as charismatic as current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who remains overwhelmingly popular.
Unfortunately for the Opposition, they tick none of the above boxes, which is probably why they are betting their houses on these quaint ocho-ocho rallies. If they can’t come up with a plan for themselves, what more for an entire nation? At least Sarah Geronimo looks like she has a plan for a life outside of ABS-CBN. It’s time Filipinos see that as their inspiration to move on as well and focus on what is important and not on just another beaten relic of a misguided accidental “revolution”.",Others
"“Free Speech. Yes. Falsehood, No.” – press statement of Wilfredo Keng on Maria Ressa’s conviction",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/free-speech-yes-falsehood-no-press-statement-of-wilfredo-keng-on-maria-ressas-conviction/,"(Official Statement of Mr. Wilfredo D. Keng on the final outcome of the Cybercrime of Libel criminal case filed against Reynaldo Santos, Jr., and Maria Angelita Ressa, of Rappler, Inc.)
When I filed this private complaint more than three years ago, I knew that this was going to be a long and painful process for me and my family. Still, I vowed to see this case to the very end. This is my bid to protect my name, and my sacrifice for my children and our future generations, who deserve nothing less than freedom in the form of absolute truth.
Today, with the judgment of conviction against Ressa and Santos promulgated by the Hon. Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa, I have been vindicated, at least, to the extent possible considering that the damage had already been done. Even today, when the truth should have set me free, Rappler’s lies still resound after the bang of the gavel has faded away.
I have been a private, hardworking businessman for 37 years now. I started out in the humblest of beginnings, a young man selling my wares on a few feet of space in the banketas of Manila. Alam ko ang pakiramdam ng walang ni isang yaman kundi ang magandang pangalan, kaya pinagsikapan kong panatilihin itong malinis sa loob ng halos apat na dekada. It is the same name I have handed down to much children, ang aking pinakamahalagang pamana sa kanila. It is also the very same name which Ressa, with one click of a button, attempted to destroy.
Not today, Ressa.
Motivated by the sheer conviction that I have done nothing to deserve the false accusations against me, I decided to go on my quest for justice even if it meant going up against Rappler, a powerful and well-funded media entity with a global reach, headed by one of Time Magazine’s “Top 100 Most Influential Women in the World” – Maria Ressa herself.
Ressa portrays herself as an alleged defender of press freedom and as a purported target of the Philippine Government, but this in no way exempts her from respecting and following Philippine laws. If anything, being a public figure, mas malaki ang kaniyang responsibilidad na magsabi ng totoo at sumunod sa batas.
As I have proven in the course of the trial, I have never been investigated or summoned for, much less charged with or convicted of, any wrongdoing or illegal act by any law enforcement agency whether here or abroad. Ressa has never disputed this, but has simply attempted to hide behind a technical plea: na sa kabila ng kanilang kasinungalingan, hindi na ako maaring magreklamo dahil lumipas na ang panahon kung kailan ko dapat isampa ito. Justly, this attempt has failed.
Ressa then dares to publicly connect my private suit to an alleged governmental attack on the Philippine Free Press.
This case is NOT a case of the government. I am a private citizen and this is a private suit. I filed my complaint prior to and independently of any case the Philippine Government may have filed against Ressa. Unlike Ressa, who attended hearings but who refused to take the witness stand, I testified in open court because I believe that I am telling the truth. I went through all stages of the legal process with no shortcuts or exemptions. To repeat, it has been more than 3 years. Had the government been, as Ressa falsely claims, connected with my private suit, maaring matagal nang natapos ang kaso na ito
This is NOT a fight against the Press Freedom, an institution I deeply respect and uphold. For years, I have personally suffered from Rappler’s false accusations against me, which false accusations have no place in a responsible and free press. Indeed, it is an accepted legal principle that libel is not protected speech. My filing AND winning this case assures Filipinos that published falsehoods will not remain unchallenged and unchecked in this jurisdiction but will instead be dealt with by law, strengthening the people’s respect for the Philippine Media in the years to come.
Bukod sa pagkaso laban sa mga kasinungalingan at libel ni Ressa noong 2012 at noong 2014, I have filed another complaint against Ressa for yet another libelous act before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati, which I hope to likewise see to its lawful and just fruition.
It is of public record: My counsel had pleaded and begged with Rappler to correct their false public accusations that I am a criminal, or at the very least, to publish my side.
They refused.
They have denied me my right to clear my name. Where else can I go to seek justice and protection but our courts?
And so I did.",Others
Maria Ressa’s apologists continue to emotionally blackmail Filipinos into hating the system that convicted her,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/maria-ressas-apologists-continue-to-emotionally-blackmail-filipinos-into-hating-the-system-that-convicted-her/,"Here is why Rappler CEO Maria Ressa lost her case against Wilfredo Keng who, several years ago, filed a case of cyber libel against her and “reporter” Rey Santos Jr. She failed to make a strong case in her defense. Evidently, no lessons were learned. We can see this in a statement issued by the Communications and Political Science departments of chi chi Ateneo dr Manila University following a court ruling that finds Ressa guilty as charged.
The statement encapsulates everything that was wrong about Ressa’s appeal to popular sentiment. She had played pathetically overused cards — (1) the false notion that this was a crackdown on dissent perpetrated by the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, (2) the Woman Card evident in a claim that this government harbours “an aversion to women who have shown the courage to defend our democratic institutions”, and (3) the Tyranny angle where, supposedly, the government “is most animated and proactive when looking for ways to intimidate and silence critics”.
Ho hum…
Here is the whole “statement” issued in a tweet fielded by the Ateneo Communications Department…
Note that not one of the legal arguments pertinent to the case and to Ressa’s conviction were addressed. The statement was no more than a sad appeal to emotion and a lame attempt at emotional blackmail using tired old rhetoric that had gone way past their use-by dates. These sad arguments (if you can even call them that) had lost potency simply because they are all not true.
Blame, perhaps, the old 1980s-vintage thinking that suggests that “popular will” not necessarily channeled through established democratic institutions and processes can simply trump that which is effected via due process. In the addled minds of Filipino wokedom, simply gathering on a Manila street in big enough numbers making shrill emotional chants and speeches will effect political change (or, at least, appease their quaint tantrums). That may have been true some years ago when street mobs succeeded at shouting down two sitting presidents, the late Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2001. Unfortunately for these snowflakes, the Philippines is now a mature democracy with a working criminal justice system and a Congress of duly-elected representatives of the electorate.
Finally, the case, ultimately, was initiated by a private citizen who demonstrated that the system could actually work in favour of the underdog — an individual going up against a powerful and well-connected media corporation. Democracy is definitely alive in the Philippines and Filipinos are, quite evidently, a free people — all contrary to what Maria Ressa and her gaggle of apologists screech to the high heavens.
Maria Ressa’s apologists need to find better copywriters for their PR paraphernalia. Better yet, they should get people who have sharp enough minds to engage in logical and intelligent debate.",Others
#ABSCBN products are mental health HAZARDS designed to elicit Filipinos’ TINGALA Reflex,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abscbn-products-are-mental-health-hazards-designed-to-elicit-filipinos-tingala-reflex/,"It took many years for Big Tobacco to be called out as an immoral industry — one that for years legally sold addictive poison to consumers who did not know better. In that context, perhaps this the time to really examine what media conglomerate ABS-CBN are really doing to Philippine society.
ABS-CBN products are, at best, like cigarettes and, at worst, as lethal as illegal drugs. Their products give a temporary addictive high to people who consume them, contribute nothing to mental well-being, and, instead, leave a permanent sense of crushing personal inadequacy in the average Filipino. The role models ABS-CBN “entertainment” put up are far beyond the reach of ordinary Filipinos. They are tall, fair-skinned, and exploit that debilitating social cancer that is Filipinos’ persistent colonial mentality.
ABS-CBN artistas are engineered to project a commanding presence that elicit Filipinos’ ingrained tingala reflex while, at the same time, disarming them with their pedestrian palengke-speak. They are products of marketing genius that reach out from our devices with those twin emotional hooks. The very nature of ABS-CBN’s business model — one that extracts most of its revenue from advertising — assures one that its products , at their core, aim to induce irrational consumerism.
ABS-CBN is, of course, a player in the free market. The cornerstone of this free market is the assumption that consumers are free to make “rational” purchasing decisions. In a way, its character and that of its products mirror the character of the market within which it plays. In reality this market is nothing like the “rational” one that “economists” lead us to believe is in place. The market — specially the Filipino market — is really an emotionally-driven one and ABS-CBN is a razor-sharp knife that easily cuts through meat fattened and made tender by the emotionalism it so expertly serves.
Like users of social media, ABS-CBN’s audience are not their customers and, more important to note, they are not the people they claim to be “in the service of”. Rather ABS-CBN’s audience are the meat product (fattened by OFW remittances and hooked in by their artistas) that they serve to their sponsors and advertisers on a buffet table to be feasted upon. Just business. Nothing personal. The point here is that the Opposition narrative that portrays ABS-CBN and its artistas as “victims” in this circus is a flat out lie.
The truth is, there are lots of people, businesses, and communities out there that could quickly fill the void that ABS-CBN would leave if it were to vanish off the face of the Earth tomorrow. If ABS-CBN were to disappear as such, the Philippines’ arts scene would be vastly invigorated. Gone will be the Goliath in the industry that crushes all the little Davids that dare go up against it with their independent productions and imagination-rich original ideas. Indeed, it is interesting to observe that the biggest defenders and apologists of ABS-CBN are the very people who lament the artistic bankruptcy of Philippine mass media. Then again that’s no surprise given the track record of today’s Opposition — specifically partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan — in being selective in their chosen advocacies on the basis of whether or not these fit their preferred political narrative.
The time is ripe for ABS-CBN to be called out for what it really is — a big bad corporation that profits massively off the ignorance of the Filipino masses. It’s high time something is done about it. Shutting ABS-CBN down is, in fact, the least of Filipinos’ challenges. The bigger challenge is in undoing the vast and profound cultural damage ABS-CBN has wreaked across Philippine society.",Others
Maria Ressa’s criminal conviction is a victory for the Filipino people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/maria-ressas-criminal-conviction-is-a-victory-for-then-filipino-people/,"They said the whole world was watching. If that was the case, then the whole world knows Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and her former writer Reynaldo Santos Jr are now convicted criminals. This was after a Manila court judge found both of them guilty of violating the cyber libel law. The question is, are members of the international community going to respect the decision of a local court or are they going to look down on this decision because they assume everything that happens in a Third World country like the Philippines is a “travesty”?
Indeed, as soon as the decision was handed down, foreign journalists and high-profile individuals like former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their outrage on social networking site Twitter. There was enough support for Ressa to convince us that she would have been more successful as a lobbyist than a journalist. She certainly had a lot of foreigners fooled — foreigners who already had preconceived notions about the Philippines being a “rogue state”, no thanks to Ressa herself who has been telling everyone who cares to listen that “it’s worse than a war zone”. They all think “democracy is dead” and that “press freedom” is being undermined by the current government. They all blame President Rodgrigo Duterte and accuse him of “weaponizing” the law.
As expected, Ressa and supporters both local and abroad were all “shocked” by the verdict. They thought her PR blitz around the world would be enough to acquit her of the libel case filed by Wilfredo Keng – a private individual who was wronged when a 2012 Rappler article written by Santos published damning claims that Keng lent his sports utility vehicle to then Chief Justice Renato Corona. This was during Corona’s impeachment trial and Rappler played a big role in demonising the former magistrate. A series of articles painting Corona under a negative light were published during the trial including that particular one claiming Keng was involved in human and drug trafficking. They were trying to convince the public that Corona was hanging out with the “wrong” crowd.
I guess you could say the ghost of Corona is still haunting the people who wronged him. He died a broken man shortly after being removed from his post in the Supreme Court. Ressa and her Rappler team played a role in his removal by engaging in character assassination. Those who support Ressa, especially those who did not follow Corona’s trial almost a decade ago, have no idea what they are talking about. Rappler published libelous content against a private individual just to help convict a former Chief Justice. Ressa deserves what she got for supporting former President Benigno Simeon Aquino’s crusade against an innocent man he considers his enemy. Keng is not Ressa’s only victim, but Keng brought justice not just to himself but also to Corona and the public who saw the injustice Ressa was committing then.
Expressions of support for Ressa would have you believe that the judge who presided over the case is corrupt and only bowed to Duterte’s wishes. They are disrespecting the rule of law by saying this. It is quite baffling considering Ressa still needs the court for her appeal. A smart person would want the judges to be on her side. That’s not going to happen if she keeps saying they are in cahoots with Duterte. It would be stupid of her and her supporters to malign members of the judiciary and paint them as Duterte’s lap dogs. The judiciary is an independent branch of government. Duterte cannot dictate his wishes on the judges. To say Ressa’s conviction is because of Duterte is tantamount to saying the court judges are corrupt. Whoever is saying that should be prosecuted.
Ressa and her supporters do not feel sorry for Keng. Rappler damaged his reputation but they still do not want to accept that the article they published broke the cyber libel law. She is not remorseful and doesn’t seem to have any plans of apologising. She keeps insisting that she is entitled to “press freedom”.
The concept behind press freedom is having the right to print or publicise factual information that is vital to the interests or safety of the public. It is not about the right to malign others without suffering the consequences. As a matter of fact, Ressa abused her power as a so-called journalist. She violated other people’s right to due process. She condemned people like Corona and Keng by publishing unverified and false information about them.
Ressa also continues to condemn Duterte before the international community by insisting he stifles dissent and is killing democracy. But Ressa and the rest of the Opposition have been saying that since Day One of Duterte’s Presidency. They contradict themselves everytime they say that. They have been enjoying their freedom to complain under Duterte for years. Proof of this is the fact that Ressa’s jet-setting lifestyle was not affected despite her incessant accusations against Duterte. She can go in and out of the Philippines without any hassle.
The members of the press will be fine as long as they don’t publish libelous content. I really hope other members of the media will learn from this. The conviction of former Rappler staff Santos Jr together with Ressa for violating the cyber libel law should serve as a warning to other Rappler staff. Ressa got Santos in trouble because she is a bad editor and her other cases still pending could prove she is a bad CEO. That could spell the end for Rappler. If I were them, I would look for another job now and not wait for the company to fold.
It’s getting tiring to read articles painting Ressa as a victim. She is not. She has a powerful tool — a media company that can and did ruin people’s reputations. She is just hiding behind the “press freedom” mantra. That freedom doesn’t include maligning others she doesn’t agree with.
I hate to rain on everyone’s parade, but it remains to be seen if Ressa will meet her cell mates any time soon. She is out on bail and will appeal before the highest court in the land. She is already using her conviction to advance her agenda to have Duterte removed by an international syndicate. We will see if her American citizenship will get her US support. But that can only mean the Philippine government can charge her with treason. I don’t think that is bailable.",Others
Carlo Katigbak should resign as President and CEO of ABS-CBN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/carlo-katigbak-should-resign-as-president-and-ceo-of-abs-cbn/,"Carlo Katigbak had one job as chief executive of embattled media conglomerate ABS-CBN. He was paid the big bucks not only to secure the investment of the company’s shareholders but to ensure an acceptable return on their investment is squeezed out of the enterprise every year. But under Katigbak’s watch, ABS-CBN share prices had gone down more than 15 percent over the last 12 months and are down more than five percent year to date at the close of Friday trading. That’s not that big a disaster considering the network’s disastrous year having fought and lost a battle to have its franchise to broadcast renewed. With that bomb going off, a huge chunk of the company’s annual revenue stream dried up. Katigbak failed to defuse that bomb while he could.
If I were a shareholder of ABS-CBN, I’d be hopping mad and calling for Katigbak’s head. Most of the chatter on social media painting ABS-CBN as a victim are not hard-nosed investors. They blame everything and everyone for the demise of the Philippines’ biggest media network — everyone, that is, except its CEO Carlo Katigbak. Indeed, so full are they of the Kool Aid poured down their throats by the hotshot mega-paid PR and brand managers of ABS-CBN that they forget that it is the job of any executive management team of any business to ensure this sort of disaster does not happen and its shareholders are kept laughing all the way to the bank year in and year out.
Katigbak’s job was to do what it takes to ensure ABS-CBN kept enriching its shareholders. Everything short of doing just that are mere excuses. Failing to do that means failure as a CEO. It’s really that simple. A CEO’s job is that simple. You fuck up, your head rolls.
How did Katigbak fuck up? He did not do what it took to keep the company he was singularly accountable for afloat in the political storm. See, when you are responsible for the wealth of your shareholders and the livelihoods of your employees, you kiss the asses of everyone who has the power to shut your business down. ABS-CBN fantards insist that history will judge those congressmen who voted to not renew the network’s broadcast franchise. I don’t think so. When all the chi chi idealism over “principles and integrity” dissipates and all everyone has left are a bunch of unemployed former ABS-CBN employees losing their homes and making a beeline for the GMA Network’s Department for Hiring and Firing, a child-like voice will pipe up from the woodwork and regard the naked emperor: Carlo Katigbak should have just kissed Duterte’s ass.
Will Katigbak’s head roll? If it does not, if the members of the ABS-CBN Board are too inbred to do their job, Katigbak should do the right thing — the honourable thing.",Others
#ABSCBN is wasting its time and its brand relying on “people power” and celebrity “fandom”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abscbn-is-wasting-its-time-and-its-brand-relying-on-people-power-and-celebrity-fandom/,"The clock is ticking for ABS-CBN. With every day that the gigantic corporation bets its fate on the “support” of the Opposition, particularly its most rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) and the shrill “fandom” of its congress of talentless starlets, its once-ascendant brand equity is diminished several notches.
For one thing, the Yellowtards are a vastly-reduced political force. In the last three years they had lost two important elections. In 2016 their fall from grace over 30 years of dishonest domination of Philippine politics culminated and set the stage for the ascent to power of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. The last one in 2019 — one that was crucial for much-needed Yellowtard control of Congress — was a complete catastrophe that saw the total evisceration at the polls of an eight-strong Yellowtard coalition. It is therefore astounding that ABS-CBN now rely on the same lot of failed “activists” and “thought leaders” to save their hide.
Most baffling is the way they now deploy their top “talent” to the frontlines to marshal their respective “fandoms” to do their crooked PR work. The biggest casualties of this failed campaign were the crown jewels of the Kapamilya “talent” pool — reality TV product Kim Chiu, manufactured face Coco Martin, and the test tube “love team” pair of Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla (a.k.a. the monumental national cringe known as “KathNiel”). Chiu ended up apologising for her awkward incoherence, Martin had his lavish and decadent lifestyle laid bare to critical scrutiny, and Bernardo was reduced to inviting people to “kiss [her] f*cking legs”.
All the while one wonders what tangible actions the chi chi Atenistas and other Catholic private school “istas” that inhabit the executive suites of Big Corporate ABS-CBN are actually doing. One would think the ABS-CBN Board will by now have grown impatient with the astounding incompetence of the executive team they had entrusted their fortunes to. Then again, there is such a tiny number of such chi chi private schools and exclusive residential enclaves that the inbred nature Metro Manila’s corporate high society makes such taking to task in the Philippines’ corporate world virtually impossible.
All that taken together, it seems we are witnessing a slow corporate collapse the likes of which mirror the 30-year-long running aground of the Yellowtard narrative that once dominated Filipino headspace. ABS-CBN got to where it is today through dishonest, barely-legal means propped up by a dishonest, barely-coherent political narrative. Fitting that they would rest their entire strategy on a failed partisan force and a brain-dead celebrity clique.
One would say a corporation with the sorts of brains ABS-CBN had at the helm would have long perished in the Darwinian landscape of a true and competitive free market. This, however, is the Philippines where propping up lameness and wrong thinking is big business. ABS-CBN is big business operating on that premise and perhaps its day of reckoning has arrived.

"ABS-CBN demise: It’s the SYSTEM, Students!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-demise-its-the-system-students/,"The recent junking of the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN is a welcome breath of fresh air. As I’ve wrote on my previous article, I really, truly couldn’t care less if ABS-CBN goes off the air. My sentiment is still the same. ABS-CBN has played political kingmakers for decades, dumbed down its audiences with its roster of inane and intellectually insulting shows, and has had a history of slanted and biased reporting.The Filipinos can do without it, and in fact, can do better.I applaud the incumbent for his supposed “dismantling” of the oligarchs, but it is now time to listen to the people who are directly affected by this dismantle: the workforce.While the guilt-tripping used by the pro-ABS-CBN crowd is easily dismissible as a simple appeal to emotions, I reluctantly admit that they have a point.Hear me out.By “dismantling” an oligarchic regime, Rodrigo Duterte won a small victory for the Filipino masses. Emphasis on small. By “dismantling” one of the bastions of the Lopez Empire, Duterte curtailed an abusive ruling clan at the expense of the alleged 11,000 or (as Maria Ressa would erroneously claim) 11 million employees—whatever.But this is not, by any means through his administration’s fault. It’s just how the Constitution is. Much as how the Constitution was “weaponized” (or whatever the moronic term is) to dethrone the Lopezes, it is also the Constitution that is the root cause of why we look upon oligarchs for much of the bulk of job generation in the country and why we simply cannot escape the grasp of the oligarchs.The 60-40 rule imposed by the Filipino First Policy in the 1987 Constitution may have had the grandiose intentions of “providing jobs for Filipinos by Filipinos,” but as history would be the judge, that good intention paved the way for our own highway to hell.Not only did the 60-40 rule ensure that only Filipinos can own major businesses in the country, but it also cemented and established the pole position Filipino oligarchs enjoy today.As a result, they become virtually uncontested in their respective fields of industry, making businesses effectively one form or another of monopolies, or duopolies: business schemes characteristic of a working—but ultimately dysfunctional—oligopoly.And as with any market that has no healthy competition, prices are bound to get high while quality of services and goods provided are left almost solely at the mercy of the providers.This is why we get crappy shows such as “Ang Probinsyano” and crappy entertainers such as Vice Ganda. Similarly, this is also why we get crappy customer service on any utility or service that is owned by an oligarch. This is not because they cannot provide better quality of services or goods but mainly because with the existing system, we are simply forced to put up with how they run things. We are, effectively, hostages.We can’t simply switch to another better service provider as there is none. It’s either this crappy corporation or that crappy corporation. Same, same, but different, but still same. Crappy.Ergo, I humbly suggest that if we will not change the Constitution soon, then we should at least remove the Filipino First Policy through a revision.“bUt RoNn, fIliPiNoS wIlL bEcOmE sLaVeS iN tHeIr OwN cOuNtRy…”Shut up and read on.Filipinos, culturally speaking, have an employee mindset. Much unlike our Chinese and half-Chinese brothers and sisters, we did not inherit their savvy for business and entrepreneurship. We don’t aspire to build big businesses, we aspire to be employees. Go ahead, ask a graduating college student on what they want to do after school, and rarely will you find someone who will immediately answer that they want to start a business.No, most of us are employees through and through. This is further evidenced by the fact that our largest exports are not products but warm bodies. OFW-ism is merely a spawn of our culture of employee mindset and the gaping hole on our job generating capabilities. The oligarchs—admittedly the major job generators in the country—can only do so much.Our ever-ballooning population combined with the number of major business players in the country (i.e. the oligarchs, again) being countable with one’s fingers make for an equation of a simply unsustainable discrepancy between job hunters and jobs with actual competitive salary.However, open the economy to Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) by removing the 60-40 rule and a healthy competition can be foreseen to follow suit. With the entry of foreign competitors, local players will be forced to shape up and actually provide better services lest they risk losing their customers to other service providers.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, job seekers will then enjoy more diverse opportunities as there are now more players in the field. In the similar vein, consumers will no longer be held hostage by mediocre services and skyrocketing prices.This is by no means a magic bullet solution, though. Government agencies will still be required to shape up. Just because a healthy competition is established, it does not mean that abuses will no longer be committed. But I digress.Going back to ABS-CBN and the “plight” of mass media, I would defer to the wisdom of the framers of the 1987 Constitution. The Constitution provided that only Filipinos can own mass media outfits as the Fourth Estate, in all its powers, can be used by a foreign country as an invasive propaganda machine. Here, I will be taking a shot at and making an example of Rappler—a supposed “mass media entity” that was found to have been stained with foreign ownership by the Omidyar Network, and is currently embattled with not only tax evasion charges but also libel cases due to its penchant for slanted reporting.But perhaps we can at least provide some form of laxity in the definition of “mass media” and instead limit ownership of news outlets and all other informational media to Filipinos and the government; and allow ownership of strictly entertainment media to both Filipinos and foreigners.It’s just a suggestion; feel free to take it with a grain of salt.Ultimately, the only way I can see for change to truly come is not to simply change the people who are currently in power but to overhaul the system itself. Let’s not go for band-aid solutions presented by promises of politicians during elections but instead think of the long-term. Change has come under the Duterte administration. The question is: How long will it last?",Others
“Influencers” should lead the way in educating voters and not contribute to making them dumber,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/influencers-should-lead-the-way-in-educating-voters-and-not-contribute-to-making-them-dumber/,"Elections are just around the corner again and it will be interesting to see whether the campaigns that will be in full swing soon will be any different to the ones we beheld in previous elections. Will these campaigns appeal to intelligence? Or will, as tradition holds, these appeal to base emotions and shallow showbiz tastes?
To be fair, the goal in an election campaign — specially in the Philippines where the popular vote directly determines who gets to be head of government — is popularity and, therefore, what appeals to mass Filipino tastes wins. As such, it is likely that we will be seeing a lot of the same ocho-ocho politics and “activism” we’ve seen before — singing, dancing, “endorsements” from celebrities, and the candidates themselves engaged in all sorts of TikTok-styled stunts and buffoonery just to achieve the virality and clout that today’s social media politics demand.
Might I suggest, in the face of this stark reality of Philippine politics, that real influencers who seek to genuinely influence the Filipino vote in the right way step back from this tradition of idiocy and serve as examples for all the rest? Perhaps leave the emo and showbiz tactics to the traditional “activists” and politicians and to long-discredited “political bloggers” and be the beacon of critical thinking over this campaign period? That’s not too much to ask. There are a lot of serious issues to be highlighted and debated, bad behaviour in our politicians that demand intelligent scrutiny, and lots of traditional cultural dysfunction in our politics to be rooted out that we are better off focusing on.
Dancing and acting like divas on videos posted on Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok will not improve the Filipino voter’s ability to dissect these issues and engage in productive conversation to come up with solutions and ways forward. Traditional campaigns, idiotic influencing on social media, and dishonest persuasion methods will simply yield the same dysfunctional social and political outcomes. Suffice to say, people who genuinely want to see real social and economic progress in Philippine society exist in all partisan camps. Unfortunately they are out-gunned by a parasitical clique of Netizens who are only out for fame and digital clout and will not think twice about muddying the debate just to direct attention to their antics. These parasites will turn serious issues and topics of national consequence into circuses just for the clicks, retweets, likes, and shares. Meanwhile, Filipinos simply get dumber as they gleefully consume these digital opiates.
Influencers who have big followings should encourage their audience to think and not just to watch. This is what it really means to engage one’s community. Engaging means inviting one’s followers to conversation and is not just about putting up a showbiz performance that reduces them to mobs of fantards who passively consume instead of actively and intelligently participate.
As the old cliché goes, with great power comes great responsibility. What are you going to do with the great power that comes with your big audience? Make people smarter, make the issues clearer, and induce innovative thinking? Or turn them into fawning morons, starstruck beyond all recognition? We can choose to be real instruments of change and yet many choose to be mere entertainers who pretend to take important positions on important matters. It’s high time we choose what is right.",Others
"@StephenSackur HardTalks Maria Ressa, tells her to GET REAL!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/stephensackur-hardtalks-maria-ressa-tells-her-to-get-real/,"Rappler CEO Maria Ressa may have suckered an entire Western news media industry into spreading her lies, but not Stephen Sackur, renowned hard-hitting investigative journalist and host of the BBC’s show Hard Talk. Cornering Ressa for such a talk, Sackur asks all the hard questions of Ressa; how, despite all her claims that a climate of “fear” blankets Philippine society and that dissenting voices such as hers (of course) are being threatened, Duterte continues to command public approval most world leaders could dream of.
This leads Sackur to ask pointedly…
Do Filipinos really care about Maria Ressa or Rappler?
Listen to Maria Ressa stammer out a lame and, quite frankly, bullshit response to Sackur’s hard questions here or watch her here…
Evidently not convinced, Sackur suggests that Ressa really needs to get real. She lives in a secure gated residential enclave that leaves her lots of latitude and headspace to worry about imagined — clearly self-serving — issues that, in actual fact, are far from the pressing more “street level” concerns of ordinary Filipinos.
Drawing from Ressa’s assertions that Filipinos, specifically “journalists” are living in dangerous times, Sackur asks if she fears for the safety of her staff at Rappler. Ressa starts off answering in a roundabout way with her favourite analogy of a “Damocles sword” hanging over people’s heads (she uses this at least three or four times over the course of the interview). Nonetheless, she simply fails to answer the question flat out. Indeed, she fails to answer that and most of Sackur’s hard questions for that matter. Listen carefully to Ressa’s waffling answers and, clearly, they are all non-answers.
As for the “international support” Ressa likes to brag about, Sackur points out that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte enjoys the “friendship” of US President Donald Trump, has developed close relations with China, and has all but “neutralised” the influence of the International Criminal Court on the Philippines’ domestic affairs. Sackur then asks Ressa: Has the international community let you down?
Sackur’s question was about international support for her. Unfortunately, Ressa again went off-topic and rambled on about how Duterte did this and did that. By then, Ressa was clearly running out of steam to power her bullshit machine. She was increasingly becoming incoherent and halting in her manner responding to the question.
Luckily Sackur brings her back to the point he was making; that notwithstanding whatever Ressa says, both Trump and Duterte had been exceedingly successful sidelining the media and using social media to influence public sentiment to their political ends. As expected, Ressa launches into that other favourite spiel of hers — that technology is to blame for all that. She singles out Facebook, just short of citing how it was “weaponized” against people like her. Fortunately, just before she got to that, Sackur begged to interrupt and pointed out that Ressa was essentially saying that democracy does not work. “If you are talking about manipulated public opinion,” Sackur asks, then she is, he continues, “de-legitimising” the people’s right to choose their government; that if, as she asserts, their opinions are “fake”, then democracy does not work.
Ressa agreed and confirmed that she is, indeed, asserting that “democracy is dead” in the Philippines. What “killed it” she insists are social media platforms that have become “behavioural modification systems”. Sackur interrupts again. “This is dangerous territory,” he points out. Ressa, Sackur observed, is suggesting Duterte does not have a mandate. But the fact is, Sackur stresses “this man [Duterte] has an extraordinary mandate”. Ressa stands her ground and claims that this mandate is being propped up by “lies lies lies” spread on social media. Evidently, Sackur wasn’t convinced. Maria Ressa simply missed just about every single one of the points in his questions.
Sackur moves on and raises the reality that Duterte rose to power on the back of a mass disillusionment over the failed promises of the “people power” narrative and the “human rights” rhetoric that underlies it. He points out that the political landscape that arose following the 1986 “people power” revolution was and continues to be virtually identical to that surrounding the “regime” it supposedly toppled. Amazingly, Ressa agreed and, in a pained manner, had to agree that the “revolution” was “a failure”. Unfortunately Ressa then reverts back to blaming social media for enabling, supposedly, a reversion back to “fascism” as the “failure of liberal democracy” became evident (she claims).
Sackur ends the show shortly after all that. Probably just as well considering Ressa was, quite simply, becoming just a waste of his time and that of his listeners.",Others
3 reasons why the communists and Yellowtards are to blame for everything going wrong in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/3-reasons-why-the-communists-and-yellowtards-are-to-blame-for-everything-going-wrong-in-the-philippines/,"No one will argue against the fact that the Philippines is in crisis today. But what is unnecessarily debatable is how the government should be responding to it. With a pandemic ravaging the Philippines, there are three things that are essential for a national government to be on top of: a strong military, a capability to track the movements of its citizens, and precise authoritative communications.
By their very nature, the Opposition — led by two ideologically-dishonest blocs — are undermining all these essential government measures. These two blocs, the Yellowtards (whose members are rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists, are ideologically inclined towards seizing power illegally by creating an environment of confusion and distrust — fertile ground for their so-called “people power” and “workers'” revolutions respectively. Because they operate these “revolutionary” networks, it is in their interests to see an incapable Philippine military, a weak state surveillance apparatus, and a confusing information dissemination landscape prevail.
Thus as follows are the true cornerstones of the Opposition agenda.
* * *
(1) Demonise the Philippine military and police establishments.
The Yellowtards and communists are ideologically-conditioned to demonise the Philippines’ state forces by painting them as the all-around bad guys in their “fight” for the Philippines’ “oppressed” people. For them the police and army are instruments of “fascism” and “state terror” and are not to be trusted. As such, the Yellowtards and communists, as a bloc, will oppose any investment in uplifting the capability of these services. The result of their relentless campaign against the military and police is the decades of neglect evident today.
(2) Create a general fear of government national identity management and surveillance measures.
The Yellowtards and communists will always see surveillance — even in the interests of the greater public and national security — as a threat to their networks of agents engaged in initiatives meant to destabilise and even terrorise Filipinos. As such, they strongly opposed the implementation of a national identification system and will continue to undermine its implementation. They will also mount fear mongering campaigns against any sort of technological solution to support contact tracing measures to collect data essential to manage the raging COVID-19 pandemic. For example, back in mid 2020, Opposition “social news network” Rappler bannered the sensational headline “borderline spyware” to describe the StaySafe app endorsed by the Philippines’ National Security Adviser Hermongenes Esperon Jr. The article used as reference “expert advise” from sources that were evidently cherry-picked to make statements that fit the preferred narrative of “reporter” Pia Ranada who wrote;
Despite StaySafe’s official designation, some members of the IT community and even a former ICT government official, worry about its data privacy measures. They also worry about how data gathered by the platform will be used by government – particularly the security agencies that have taken an interest in the app.
Fueling these concerns is the passage by Congress of the anti-terror bill, which law experts say, gives security officials dangerous powers, including prolonged and broadened surveillance.
All this takes place under the shadow of a deadly pandemic which United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said has given countries like the Philippines an excuse to crack down on legitimate dissent.
Note, specially, how Ranada uses as reference the words of a foreign “expert” on the Philippines’ internal affairs — as if it is only such Western insight into the goings-on within her country that enjoy enough gravitas to lend legitimacy to her “report”.
(3) Foment distrust of information outside of media channels the Opposition control.
Much of the shrillness surrounding fad notions of “disinformation” and “fake news” originate from the Yellowtards and communists — the earlier with their “fake news” fear mongering and the latter with their “red tagging” outrage fad. It is also quite convenient that the entire traditional mainstream media industry is reeling from the impact that mass access to social media has had on their big corporate bottom lines. As such, the Yellowtards and communists have found allies in the taipans that control the handful of enormous media conglomerates that, between themselves, virtually monopolise the Philippines’ mass information dissemination infrastructure. It is evident this monopoly is fast being eroded by alternative channels and they are fighting tooth and nail to protect their businesses.
* * *
In short, the Opposition offer nothing positive or forward looking and are campaigning on the back of a dishonest negative narrative — nothing more but to demonise, create fear, and embed distrust in Philippine society. That’s not a very constructive agenda and seeks to achieve the opposite, which is to destroy.
More importantly, these three focus areas are the building blocks of their crooked “activist” agendas. Firstly, the Opposition sustain a shrill awareness campaign of the Duterte administration’s “failure” to contain the external threat posed by China on the Philippines’ offshore interests in the South China Sea. Yet they would oppose any significant investment in the country’s military capabilities insisting, using their traditional “helping the poor” trope, to suggest where those funds could be “better spent”. Second, they harp about how the government fails to implement basic measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic like contact tracing yet would balk at any initiative that they could construe to be “state surveillance” in nature. Third, they would dismiss information disseminated outside of channels controlled by their cronies in Big Corporate Media as “fake news” but would carry on amongst themselves in their little chi chi echo chambers exchanging unsubstantiated factoids that they deem conveniently supportive of their preferred narratives. There are many other examples of the dishonest narratives the Yellowtards and communists craft using other permutations and combinations of these three key ingredients.
This is why the Opposition will fail to seize power legally in the coming years as long as they are  “led” by the Yellowtards and the communists. Their entire campaign platform is built on just three discredited pillars maintained by these two partisan blocs — demonise the military and police, monger fear over normal “state surveillance” most governments sustain in other countries, and call on people to distrust information channels outside of their circle of media cronies. The time has come to see through the false veneer of “decency” and “righteousness” these group use to mask their crooked ways. It’s time Filipinos put their foot down and put a stop to Yellowtard and communist criminal hypocrisy.",Others
ABS-CBN execs nowhere to be seen in pro-ABSCBN protest rallies!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-execs-nowhere-to-be-seen-in-pro-abscbn-protest-rallies/,"ABS-CBN starlet Angel Locsin is currently being put up as a goddess of ABS-CBN fandom. Such is this reverence for the celebrity that even the foremost “thought leaders” of Yellowtardom (the community of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) now even see Locsin as a possible presidential bet presumably for the coming 2022 presidential elections.
This is all because of her now-viral denunciation of her fellow showbiz celebrities who refuse to take part in these protest rallies. Lashing out at them yesterday in a speech before a crowd gathered in front of the ABS-CBN head office in Quezon City, Locsin issues the challenge, “Ano magpapa-cute na lang kayo sa Instagram?” (“Are you all just content glamming yourselves on Instagram?”).
What is interesting is how selective all this is, all true to form with the selective “activism” the Yellowtards are renowned for. It seems Locsin and her cheerleaders conveniently neglect the fact that none of the chi chi execs of their beloved network are coming out to demonstrate their “solidarity” with their hapless former employees. Beyond making their token appearances waving at the crowds from their air-conditioned SUVs, there seems to be hardly any evidence that the business leaders have any actual skin in the Yellowtards’ game.
For his part, all Ernie Lopez, CEO of ABS-CBN Publishing Inc, could contribute to the “cause” was to wave the trademark Yellowtard “L” hand gesture at protestors as he whizzed by in his chauffeur-driven car.
Network CEO Carlo Katigbak “was there” but couldn’t be bothered to get off his expensive SUV to mingle with the crowd.
The elephant in the room here is that it is the Lopezes and the ABS-CBN executive team headed by Katigbak who had actually failed the starlets and employees of ABS-CBN. CEOs are paid the big bucks because the buck stops with them — specifically with the CEO, in fact. Posturing as the “victim” all the more highlights this failure.
This is the reason such selectiveness is on exhibit in the dishonest “activism” of these sheep-like supporters of the once mighty Kapamilya network. There are no friends in business, only financial interests. Truly cluey celebs like Sarah Geronimo, who Locsin was evidently referring to in her “pa-cute” tirade, are right to move on. There is nothing left in ABS-CBN that is in their interests to stick their necks out for. Time to move on, coz life’s too short. Showbiz rewards the young and beautiful and both those things are assets too precious to waste on a relic of the 1980s like ABS-CBN.",Others
Dishonestly claiming its business was about “serving Filipinos” is #ABSCBN’s biggest crime,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/dishonestly-claiming-its-business-was-about-serving-filipinos-is-abscbns-biggest-crime/,"It couldn’t have been better timing. With ABS-CBN blinking out from the airwaves and Filipinos on COVID-19 lockdown, a new and very promising normal for Filipinos is on hand. Cooped up within their homes, Filipinos will soon learn how to entertain themselves without the perverted “entertainment” shoved down their throats supposedly “in the service of the Filipino” by this big BAD media conglomerate.
Without the Kapamilya Network’s brain candy and the isolation that could only build character in people who learn to suck it up and deal with it — specifically learn to read, be self-sufficient and not be dependent on externalities (such us idiotic TV programming) for their well-being, and work on self-improvement — Filipinos might actually emerge from this crisis a stronger people.
ABS-CBN execs and their employees may also perhaps acquire an important virtue — humility. For three decades and a half, they have been led to believe that they are God’s Gift to the Filipino people even as they pretended to live by their dishonest mission statement “In the service of the Filipino”. Unlike former Senator Ninoy Aquino Jr who died (“martyred”, we are told) and then had an airport named after him, one cannot draw parallels to Ninoy from what happened to ABS-CBN. The narrative fashioned about it by Yellowtardom perhaps succeeded in turning ABS-CBN into a living hero. Now that it is dead, the Yellowtards (partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) will work hard to turn it into a legend — perhaps even name an airport after it.
The fact is, rather than serve Filipinos, ABS-CBN turned them into opiate addicts. After all, teleseryes, noontime variety shows, underage “love teams”, talentless celebrities, screeching transvestites, and, yes, tabloid news “reporting” are the opiates of the Filipino masses. To the argument that ABS-CBN provided “essential public service” through its broadcast news, one first needs to question whether the sort of broadcast “news” ABS-CBN served up to Filipinos is actually such. In truth, news and journalism under the watch of ABS-CBN was, itself, turned into low-brow entertainment and is now a pale shadow of the sober practice that it used to be when stalwarts like Tina Monzon Palma, Harry Gasser, and, perhaps later, Jessica Soho did the industry justice. Today, a typical ABS-CBN “news and public affairs” program looks more like a pinball machine and nothing like the dignified forum for delivering information it is supposed to be.
Indeed, the report “Whatever Happened to the News?” published on the Center For Media Literacy describes almost to a tee the path to degeneracy ABS-CBN took the once-noble profession down…
In the early 1960s the networks, hugely profitable but worried about their images and about regulatory pressures, expanded their news operations and largely freed them from the pressures of commercial television. The “church” of news was to be separated from the “state” of entertainment.
In the 1970s and ’80s, however, the barrier between news and entertainment has been increasingly eroded. Not all the changes of these years have been for the worse. But taken together, they raise serious questions about the future of journalism in an entertainment-dominated medium. A recent edition of the news tabloid A Current Affair, for example, ended with the tease “Coming up – sex, murder and videotape, that’s next!” It may be that this is indeed the future of television news.
It was the local stations that first discovered, late in the 1960s, that news could make money– lots of money. By the end of the ’70s, news was frequently producing 60 percent of a station’s profits. With numbers like that, news was much “too important” to leave to journalists, and a heavily entertainment-oriented form of programming began to evolve. Often it was contrasted directly with the network news. ‘Feel like you’re getting a bad deal from poker-faced TV news reporters?” asked San Francisco’s KGO in one ad, “Then let the Channel 7 Gang deal you in. They’re not afraid to be friendly.”
ABS-CBN made an obscene amount of money. It earned all of it from entertaining Filipinos, not from “serving” them. Filipinos should wisen up and stop believing the lies the Yellowtards tell them about ABS-CBN.
There is nothing wrong with making an honest buck from entertainment. But dishonestly claiming its business was about “serving Filipinos” is ABS-CBN’s biggest crime to its audience. Perhaps ABS-CBN will one day be back on air. Very likely it will be broadcasting the same rubbbish that keeps its shareholders laughing all the way to the bank. Hopefully what does change is its mission statement. It should ditch its dishonest claim that it operates “in the service of the Filipino”, and stop insulting the intelligence of its viewers.",Others
ABS-CBN shutdown will strengthen Philippine institutions and compel Filipinos to follow the law,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abs-cbn-shutdown-will-strengthen-philippine-institutions-and-compel-filipinos-to-follow-the-law/,"The shutdown of media giant ABS-CBN should not have come as a surprise but, to many of the broadcast network’s employees and supporters, it was shocking and outrageous. They are acting like they didn’t know the network’s franchise to broadcast using public radio frequency was about to expire. Even the company’s executives themselves seemed baffled after they were compelled to sign off for the last time on the 5th of May 2020. This can only mean they were all in denial up to the very end. They were in denial that the current government would oblige them to follow the law. It’s something a very powerful and influential company is not used to, apparently.
CEO Carlo Katigbak appealed to the public and asked for help to express their objection to the cease-and-desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) on the operation of the television and radio of the media network. He was basically appealing to emotion, which is kind of pathetic for an executive. It shows that he wasn’t savvy enough to keep the company operating and is resorting to trickery to get his way. It’s not going to work the second time considering the same tactic – tricking Congress the first time into approving a dodgy renewal application fell through.
Contrary to what most people supportive of the company are saying, ABS-CBN’s troubles did not start when President Rodrigo Duterte came to power. While Duterte is vocal about his beef with the owners of the network, their legal problems started way back in 2014 during former President Benigno Simeon Aquino III’s term. ABS-CBN’s application for franchise renewal then was stalled because, according to Estrellita Juliano-Tamano, president of the Federation of International Cable TV and Telecommunications Association of the Philippines (FICTAP), a direct competitor of ABS-CBN’s “black box” satellite operation, “ABS-CBN’s franchise application in 2014 was allegedly no longer faithful to the original franchise agreement”.
The FICTAP had opposed the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise in 2014 as it was allegedly no longer faithful to the original franchise agreement, with six more channels added to the permit. These, Tamano said, should have operated under different franchises.
She also accused ABS-CBN of charging P2,500 pay-per-view for the Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather fight on 2 May 2015 in alleged violation of an NTC cease and desist order.
It also charged P30 for Kapamilya Box Office (KBO) programs when Tamano said the franchise is supposed to operate “free to air.”
Whether what she is saying is valid or not doesn’t really matter for now. ABS-CBN executives and supporters can tell everybody they are all false allegations but their sentiments can be dismissed as biased and, more importantly, only the court can decide what is true or not. Evidently, Congress did not tackle the renewal again after 2014. That’s an issue a lot of people cannot understand so they simply blame Duterte for the shutdown.
What is false is the claim by ABS-CBN executives and supporters that the cease-and-desist order “violates the right of the public to information and is a curtailment of the freedom speech and of the press.” The fact that they can still hold press conferences, express their views and operate other media platforms they own such as their digital streaming channels contradicts their claim. Besides, ABS-CBN is not the only source of news and information. There are dozens of media outlets out there still operating that the public can rely on to deliver much needed information.
What is true is that the ABS-CBN shutdown has a lot to do with the company’s greed. They wanted everything in one application.
The timing of ABS-CBN’s shutdown could not be helped. The government, even while the country is in the middle of a crisis due to the COVID19 pandemic, cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that a company doesn’t have a license to operate. Even former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio said that the NTC cannot issue a provisional authority to operate because there is no basis when there is no franchise.
This is actually fair for all the little people and small companies that have lost their livelihoods or those that have had to close their businesses because they didn’t have the right permit to operate. This proves that even big companies have to follow the rules. This is a win for everybody. It will set a precedent for everyone to comply with the law.
The only people now who still have a problem with following the law are the members of the Opposition. They refuse to understand the real reason why ABS-CBN was shut down. Their minds can only grasp one single theory – that it is Duterte’s fault. No wonder they keep failing their advocacy. Even some lawyers who are expected to understand law are trying to justify giving ABS-CBN a pass just because they are allied with the Opposition.
For a country with so many lawyers, it is quite ironic that some Filipinos, particularly lawmakers, still find it hard to follow the law. It seems a lot of lawyers are the ones arguing among themselves over how to interpret the law. This is not a good sign. It means they just want to work around the law or even defy it.
Celebrities under ABS-CBN’s payroll insist that the network’s operation is vital to the well-being of the people. It’s quite the opposite. The media giant has been playing kingmaker for decades and has lulled people into believing Cory, Ninoy, and Noynoy Aquino are heroes. The people were entranced and thought they were in good hands. ABS-CBN also produce a lot of garbage shows that set the country backward.  They set Filipinos to an “entertained” mode when what the people really need was a wakeup call. The Philippines cannot progress when the majority are always preoccupied with lame TV shows. It can only be good that ABS-CBN can no longer mislead the public with their biased news and dishonest reporting. They can no longer air the “life and times” of their favourite candidates before elections.
The timing of ABS-CBN shutdown is perfect because its employees and supporters cannot go out and protest. If they do, they risk arrest for violating the quarantine or getting infected with the coronavirus. The odds are all against them. Hopefully, by the time the quarantine is lifted, the public will have forgotten about them and moved on. Their celebrity supporters should accept the fact that Duterte is more popular than they are.",Others
Tina Panganiban-Perez was right to ask if #CommunityPantry organiser Ana Patricia Non had links to communist groups,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/tina-panganiban-perez-was-right-to-ask-if-communitypantry-organiser-ana-patricia-non-had-links-to-communist-groups/,"You either are or aren’t a communist. How difficult is it to answer a “yes” or “no” when asked, Are you a communist? Evidently, very difficult. This fact about the Philippines’ political and cultural minefield was brought to the fore when, in a recent press conference given by Ana Patricia Non, founder of the Maginhawa Community Pantry, GMA News reporter Tina Panganiban-Perez asked “Meron ka nga bang link sa communist groups?” (“Could you confirm if you actually do have links with communist groups?”). As a result of this simple question, Panganiban-Perez became the latest whipping girl of members of the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists who had taken to social media to whip up an  outrage fad around this.
The context behind this latest outrage fad is in reports that Non had shut down her community pantry initiative due to what she described as incidents of “red tagging” coming out against her. One would think then that if her reasons were such, then the natural question would then be whether said “red-tagging” actually does have bases. This is likely to be the motivation behind Panganiban-Perez’s line of question. In short, Panganiban-Perez was only doing her job laying the factual groundwork for the report she will presumably have filed following this conference.
Indeed, there are other bases as well to justify why such questions need to be asked of Non. As of this writing, what seems to be Non’s Facebook profile, “AP Non”, is publicly-accessible and, as such, fair game for reference. Noteworthy features of this profile include a background image of a protest rally where a banner screaming “PAG HINDI UMALSA ANG MASA, WALANG TINAPAY SA MESA” (“If the masses do not revolt, there will be no bread on the table”). The slogan is attributed to communist front and “women’s issues” group (so they claim) GABRIELA. The profile image used is a black background upon which the words “WE CRIED A RIVER NOW WE FIGHT BACK #OustDuterteNow” is written.
It is on this profile that Non seemingly announced her decision to shut down her community pantry in a post dated yesterday, the 21st April. Among other events documented on her timeline is her participation in the “Grand Mananita” rally held in the Diliman Campus of the University of the Philippines (UP) in June last year.
It is evident then if these are indeed content she had published herself on Facebook that Non is a supporter of initiatives that (1) aim to unseat the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte outside of established institutional processes and (2) incite the masses to revolt as a means to put “bread on the table”. It is reasonable then to expect a journalist worth her salt to use these observations collectively as context for the hard questions that certain members of the “activist” communities Non consorts with find uncomfortable. It is quite ironic that these very “activists” who habitually assert the entitlement of journalists to ask such hard questions are the very same ones now trying to muzzle Tina Panganiban-Perez.
In his Manila Times column “A crisis in truth seeking”, Professor Antonio Contreras writes…
I am in deep awe at investigative reporters who are able to pore over documents, some of which are even classified and secret, and interview well-placed sources, some of whom are even working for their own governments who, protected by the assurance of secrecy as a confidential source, would provide vital and credible information about the inner workings behind every government decision, or scandal.
Here, Contreras refers to those traditional bogeymen — states and governments — as roadblocks to “truth seeking”. Funny enough in this recent instance, on the question of whether or not Non is a communist, it seems it is the so-called “activists” and “thought leaders” of the Opposition who have taken the role of the personas traditionally associated with efforts to thwart said “truth seeking”. Here, again, we see the hypocritical selective nature of Yellowtard and communist “activism” on exhibit. Indeed, it is easy to see now what sorts of regimes these people would put in effect in the event they succeed at seizing power.",Others
A @nytimes “report” on the ABS-CBN shutdown written by Jason Gutierrez is full of LIES,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/a-nytimes-report-on-the-abs-cbn-shutdown-written-by-jason-gutierrez-is-full-of-lies/,"Somebody needs to “fact check” the report published by the New York Times claiming that “Duterte’s Shutdown of TV Network Leaves Void Amid Coronavirus Crisis”. Its author, Jason Gutierrez, would like his readers to believe that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is behind the shutdown and that said “shutdown” aims to silence “dissent” and echoes the claim of the broader Philippine Opposition that this is all part of a conspiracy to mount an “assault on press freedom”.
The “report”, however, starts off with a flatout lie. Gutierrez writes, “the newscasters and reporters of the TV Patrol news program had been silenced”. That’s a lie. TV Patrol is now being streamed over the Internet and, as such, remains accessible to the public.
Kapamilya, tutok na sa @TVPatrol!

Gutierrez then goes on to feature a specific on-the-ground story that is evidently cherry-picked to fit his preferred narrative.
“Now, we don’t know what’s happening,” [“slum dweller” Fe Repalde] said, as a gaggle of ducks deposited droppings on the floor of her dilapidated shack, which she shares with her husband and four children.
“We can’t turn to TV news to tell us what to do,” she added.
Not true. The fact is, ABS-CBN operates but one of several television networks that broadcast free-to-air “news” over public frequencies. Ms Repalde is at full liberty to tune in to any of these alternatives at any time. Furthermore, it is global best practice to keep conventional transistor radios ready and on hand as part of standard preparations for natural calamities. These are very affordable devices that most Filipinos already own.
For that matter, whatever else Gutierrez writes in this dishonest New York Times “report” is invalidated wholesale by the overall lie that blankets it, to begin with. This overarching lie is encapsulated in this snippet…
ABS-CBN is the first television network to be silenced by Mr. Duterte…
Not true. ABS-CBN was not “silenced” by anyone. Gutierrez is a liar. The New York Times devalues its brand everytime it gives a platform to dishonest Filipino “journalists” like Jason Gutierrez who contribute to the crisis of credibility his profession now suffers worldwide.",Others
"With exactly 12 months to go before the 2022 Philippine Election, the Opposition is in disarray",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/with-exactly-12-months-to-go-before-the-2022-philippine-election-the-opposition-is-in-disarray/,"Today’s Working Day One of the 12-month homestretch to the 2022 national elections. As much as the COVID-19 pandemic rages, the Philippine Opposition sputters. They still lack a vision to pitch the Filipino voter and a credible leader to deliver that pitch. Much of the previous year was invested by the Opposition propping up presumptive “vice president” Leni Robredo as the leader of all Philippine Opposition parties. Unfortunately that was time and bandwidth gone down the drain. Robredo remains a mere footnote in popularity surveys and, though a prolific sound bytes issuer and one backed by the Philippines’ top media channels, has so far (1) not imparted to her flock any semblance of a coherent election winning strategy, (2) shown no skill nor clout at building political coalitions, and (3) comes across as a social-climbing tita who spends her day on “issues” that have no relevance to ordinary Filipinos.
Recent days have revealed that the latter is, indeed, Robredo’s comfort zone seeing how she now spends some of her vice presidential time in the company of said titas.
Thanks to significant collateral sunk into the Robredo brand and that persistent yellow shade that the Opposition have, try as they might, been scrubbing off their personas, gaining campaign momentum has proven challenging. Meanwhile, other camps are gearing up. One is the fledgling 1Sambayan coalition led by retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio who, after an unimpressive launch of his mob in March this year, scored a media circus win with the brouhaha over a debate with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Perhaps due to his chi chi Atenista upbringing, his corporate background, and his stint in the “above politics” ivory tower that is the SC, Carpio still struggles with the notion of engaging at a level in the discourse where it counts.
One thing going for Carpio is that he has the vote of esteemed national artist F. Sionil Jose who announced today that “if former Justice Antonio Carpio will run, I’ll campaign for him.” Sionil also goes as far as endorsing Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro, former presidential candidate and Defense Secretary to former president Gloria Arroyo. “Whatever office he elects to run for, I’ll also campaign for Gilbert Teodoro,” Jose writes. If this is indication of some promise in Carpio and his bid, it would do him well to seize every opportunity to gain media mileage including stepping up to the challenge of debating whoever Duterte throws at him on the issue of the loss of Scarborough Shoal to China in 2012.
And then there are the sure things of the moment, former senator and vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos who I wrote about earlier in “The time has come for Filipinos to consider a Bongbong Marcos presidency!” and Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte, who consistently tops recent popularity and approval surveys. Unlike Carpio and Teodoro, both are seasoned politicians who have demonstrated remarkable consistency, mettle, and tenacity in their jobs and on the campaign trails. Both also have top-notch PR and messaging apparatus that had clearly given the best communications and PR minds of the Opposition literal runs for their money.
The mass media propaganda machine of the Opposition is also in disarray. One-time jewel in the blogging crown of the Opposition, Jover Laurio, has dropped the ball with her PinoyAkoBlog.com having gone offline (the URL now just redirects to its Facebook page). This is not before she tainted the personal brands of just about every guest who attended her notably under-reported wedding of the year in 2019.
So-called “social news network” Rappler consistently comes up as one of the Philippines’ least-trusted media channels. Not having learnt a thing from that stinging lesson, Rappler aspires to be the go-to information source for anything to do with the 2022 elections. In their pompous manifesto “#WeDecide: What you can do to take the Philippines back in 2022”, Rappler proclaims “Atin ang Pilipinas” (“the Philippines is ours”) and asserts “We have lost so much in the years Rodrigo Duterte is president.” So much for being the impartial reporter of the 2022 elections, right? One can’t help but wonder when mulling over what they say here…
More than demonstrating our resilience, which abusive officials have exploited when they couldn’t or wouldn’t serve our interests, we will aim to exercise our collective power to pull this nation back up.
Is Rappler a news organisation? Or is it an activist organisation? The mystery persists…
The demise of ABS-CBN was, of course, the biggest news of 2019 — “biggest” according to ABS-CBN “journalists”, that is. We are told it was “forced off the air” by the Philippine government. However, the fact is that its license had expired and was not renewed by Congress. The blame for this fiasco falls squarely on the shoulders of its chief executive, Carlo Katigbak who, quite simply, did not kiss Duterte’s ass enough as any CEO worth his or her salt would a sitting president. That’s why they’re paid the big bucks, right?
So far, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards and the strangely-silent (for this week) communist bloc within it are not living up to Filipinos’ expectations of an Opposition they deserve. What Filipinos get today is one that insults their intelligence rather than stimulates it. A democracy can only thrive with a modern and intelligent opposition party or community holding it up as one of its key pillars. Sadly, with just 12 months to go, no such Opposition is in sight. The clock is ticking. Tick tock tick tock…",Others
Cory Aquino and the dumbing down of Philippine Media the root cause of decline in quality of Filipino legislators,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/cory-aquino-and-the-dumbing-down-of-philippine-media-the-root-cause-of-decline-in-quality-of-filipino-legislators/,"Harry Roque’s law partner Joel Ruiz Butuyan complains about the quality of Senators but doesn’t put the finer on who should be blamed. Butuyan writes in his Inquirer column “Comparing past and present senators” today of “the faces of senators of the past renowned for their brilliance, juxtaposed with pictures of senators of the present who are regularly ridiculed.”
But, see, that’s actually on the leaders who tolerated the culture of mediocrity. Prior to the 1986 “revolution” that toppled the government of President Ferdinand Marcos, how many actors won elective office? Only one if my memory serves me right, Joseph Estrada. Rogelio De La Rosa ran but withdrew from the race. Actors confined themselves to local government unit (LGU) races for Councilor.
It was the Cory Aquino administration which opened the floodgates to actors switching over to politics. This was made possible by the TV networks which switched over to totally gross programming standards. Pilipino became the norm. The nightly newscast and FM radio stations weren’t spared. Even the anchors themselves became celebrities in their own right which saw the election of Noli De Castro to the Senate and Ted Failon to Congress.
Butuyan writes…
According to people’s reminiscences of politics before the Marcos dictatorship began in 1972, politicians of those years captivated the masses with their eloquent speeches, and crowds trooped to election rallies to be enthralled by the oratorical brilliance of their leaders. Our parents and grandparents chose their leaders based on superior intelligence, sterling track record, impressive academic credentials, and unblemished reputation.
What Butuyan will not admit is standards were lowered post-Marcos. The bastardization of institutions went into high-gear. Post-graduate degrees were for sale. This is why government bureaucracy is in a sorry state as well. Appointees and career officials may meet the qualifying standards but don’t have either or both the competence and the experience. Sadly even the better educated on paper are also lackluster. Just look at Drilon and De Lima. The Vice-President takes the cake. She doesn’t articulate like a lawyer. You can’t make much out of her statements because they’re basically word salads in a mix of English and Pilipino.
The main culprit is the freewheeling liberal-leftist democracy we have. There is no emphasis on discipline and high standards for government service. Government has actually become the dumping ground of the mediocre. Contrast this with Singapore where potential leaders are subject to rigorous training in terms of educational background and experience. The Senators of today hire intelligent staff members to do their thinking and write speeches for them. Diligence is also sorely lacking. In place of this is complete staff work but this is dependent on the quality of the staff they hire. Good talent is also a rarity these days. What makes it worst is hiring is also not based on qualifications but connections and loyalty to the principal.
This is why we have barely competent elected and appointed officials occupying government posts. If we want the country to become respected then we should put in the hard work of reforms in the socio-political and economic aspects of society. Otherwise we will continue our descent into becoming a nation of morons.",Others
News of a meeting between Inday Sara Duterte and Bongbong Marcos has chilling effect on Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/news-of-a-meeting-between-inday-sara-duterte-and-bongbong-marcos-has-chilling-effect-on-opposition/,"Talk of a “meeting” between Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte and former Senator and 2016 vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is raging across social media. This follows a tweet issued by a media organisation known as SMNI News Channel.
According to SMNI News as indicated in the above tweet, the meeting occurred Sunday, the 30th May. The “news” it seems is based on just the photo attached to the tweet and not much else and, according to that same tweet, this news was “confirmed” by a “source” of SMNI News.
As of this writing, no other media outlet offers any information or reports corroborating any of this. However, “national political operator” Franco Cruz Mabanta, in a tweet issued shortly after, offered a “small correction” to the SMNI “report” claiming that the meeting between Duterte and Marcos “didn’t happen” on that date. Mabanta has so far not provided any further information on the matter. It so happens too that the 30th May is Ms Duterte’s birthday.
Supporters of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte regard the supposed meeting as a strong indication that Ms Duterte and Marcos will run as a tandem in the 2022 national elections and, in doing so, supposedly doom any Opposition bid for the highest and second highest offices of the Philippine Government. The apparent basis for this prognosis are Ms Duterte and Marcos topping a survey conducted by respected polling firm Pulse Asia, the results of which were issued January this year.
The Pulse Asia survey results showed top Opposition bet and current “vice president” Leni Robredo placing a dismal sixth behind Senator Grace Poe, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, and boxing-champ-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao. Former Senator Antonio Trillanes who, some weeks ago, launched a coup against Robredo for the role of leader of top Opposition coalition 1Sambayan was not among the top “presidentiables” yielded by the survey or may not have been a choice offered to survey respondents at the time.
1Sambayan had this week set a deadline for itself committing to June 12 as the date for the release of its list of candidates for the coming elections. Following that, Robredo asserted in an interview with “journalist” Barnaby Lo on Viewpoint that she, or “someone else” should be the single Opposition presidential candidate as long as only one person runs. This, Robredo said in the the interview, is critical to ensure that the next six years after 2022 will “not be the same”. Robredo is clearly hinting that if the Opposition do not unite and ends up fielding multiple candidates, it will all but assure victory for the camp of President Duterte in 2022.
As of this writing, the Opposition has been seemingly generally quiet on any matter to do with the 2022 elections and the 1Sambayan Twitter account has not posted any new tweets in the last three days.
For now, given the sketchy information surrounding this matter, one can only turn to the timeless advise of Filipinos’ self-styled media “servant”, ABS-CBN: Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Others
#ABSCBN is TOAST after losing in Congress and losing in court!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abscbn-is-toast-after-losing-in-congress-and-losing-in-court/,"It didn’t help that the Philippines’ erstwhile top mass media corporation initially attempted to frame its legal troubles in a dishonest way and, worse, tried to pervert the honour of no less than the Philippine Senate to its corporate ends. Even in the early days, it was like a cornered animal biting at everything around it that moves after it was ordered to desist from broadcasting over public radio frequencies after its franchise to do so expired.
First, ABS-CBN execs made the fatal mistake of playing what should have been its final ace — its top Senate asset, Grace Poe — early in the game. It played Poe too early and too conspicuously when she stepped up to presumptuously chair an entire Senate “probe” into the plight of the media behemoth — an enterprise she and her family had a sizeable financial exposure to.
Next, ABS-CBN tried to make Filipinos believe it was the “victim” of an imagined government “assault on press freedom”. Unfortunately it exposed this as a lie as well by demonstrating that it remains perfectly free to stream its content over the Net. After all, the architect of that dishonest playbook is none other than “social news network” Rappler, itself a digital-only media organisation that asserts its entitlement to deliver content to a mass audience over the Net (no issue on the part of Rappler not having a franchise to broadcast over public radio frequencies, right?).
More outrageous is the way a bevy of dishonest “journalists” are publishing misleading information based on these twisted ideas using their connections in foreign media. One such “journalist” is Jason Gutierrez whose “report” on the issue published on the New York Times on how  “Duterte’s Shutdown of TV Network Leaves Void Amid Coronavirus Crisis” is filled with nothing but false information that directly echoes ABS-CBN’s asserted position.
Not surprisingly, a plea lodged by ABS-CBN before the Philippine Supreme Court that the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) shutdown order “caused ‘grave injustice and irreparable injury’ not only to the network but also to the viewing public” was thrown out in favour of opportunity granted to the NTC and both chambers of Congress to comment on the matter.
Congress, for its part, de-prioritised the ABS-CBN “issue” after House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano announced a House decision to suspend any further work on granting a provisional 5-month broadcast franchise to the network in favour of work on a more “comprehensive” 25-year franchise.
Cayetano said the decision came after lawmakers expressed varying views on the matter and in consultation with House members, political parties and groups. He said that the issue needed to be tackled more comprehensively, which was not possible with other priorities such as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.
“The House leadership have decided to forgo with the provisional franchise but we will immediately proceed with the hearings for the 25 year franchise,” Cayetano said in a speech delivered before the plenary on Tuesday.
Majority Leader Martin Romualdez said the plenary would now refocus on pending measures in response to the pandemic while the ABS-CBN franchise would be heard at the committee level.
Time and money is running out for ABS-CBN. Its brand equity is being eroded as it deploys its top “talent” to the job of doing its dirty PR work and directs them to rally their respective “fandom” to the corporate cause. Worse, in doing so, this very same “talent” are revealing themselves to be the dull witless hollow-heads everyone suspected they were as they aired their incoherent opinion and quaint temper tantrums on the issue over social media. More importantly, with every week that passes, Filipinos get used to not seeing ABS-CBN’s trashy content polluting their airwaves and wean themselves off the deadly media opiate they are being fed by the Kapamilya network.",Others
Who killed ABS-CBN? Its “news” team did!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/who-killed-abs-cbn-its-news-team-did/,"It is too bad that employees of embattled media network ABS-CBN are paying for the sins of the “journalists” of the network’s “Current Affairs” Department. After all, the primary reason ABS-CBN rubbed the powers-that-be the wrong way is because of the slanted, sloppy, mediocre “reporting” it passed off to hapless Filipino viewers as “journalism”.
It is interesting, however, to see how the media giant is now calling on its showbiz “talent” and the throngs in their respective “fandoms” to come to its rescue. Fronting the current entertainment (what they call “activism” nowadays) is newly-crowned “hero” of the Kapamilya mob Angel Locsin who now leads a campaign to emotionally blackmail her colleagues into joining the “fight” (this fight being some sort of nebulous effort to magically renew ABS-CBN’s franchise to broadcast very likely outside of due process).
It is too bad Locsin cannot simply scream “Darna” and fly off with fist thrust forward to vanquish her “enemy” (however way she and her fans define it). In Locsin, Kapamilya fans very likely continue to see the same fictional comic book hero they grew up with and, perhaps, ogled in lockstep watching Locsin in the lead role of Darna on TV in 2005. Guess who was laughing all the way to the bank following the success of that franchise? Why, no less than the shareholders of ABS-CBN!
To be fair, the only hope of ABS-CBN winning the quaint PR “war” they are waging today lies in starlets such as Angel Locsin. This is because their top-gun telejournalist celebs — the likes of Karen Davila and Korina Sanchez, to name a couple — have become liabilities to such a dishonest campaign. Indeed, it is quite telling that the network would now rather have an old Darna actress speak for their cause rather than these “current affairs” stalwarts who one would have thought would be in better positions to speak to the core issues of this matter.
Goes to show ABS-CBN have neither legal nor political leg to stand on. They are mobilising popularity to address what is essentially a foregone administrative matter their execs, led by that other accidental “hero” Carlo Katigbak, failed to manage competently.",Others
ABS-CBN was a failed experiment in trusting the private sector to shape national culture,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-was-a-failed-experiment-in-trusting-the-private-sector-to-shape-national-culture/,"Looking back at how ABS-CBN had influenced Philippine society, one can argue that the whole franchise was a failure. Supporters of the failed network hinge the whole rationale of its existence on “media freedom”. But, while there is clear merit in media freedom, this freedom does not seem to have been applied wisely in the Philippines. While that freedom, in principle, will have ideally encouraged diversity in culture, thinking, and production, media production in the Philippines has, instead, gravitated into today’s dominant monoculture of shallow cinema, trashy television, unoriginal music, and offensive Web content. Suffice to say, unleashing “media freedom” in the Philippines was the equivalent of granting a seven-year-old child unlimited access to the Internet.
Indeed, the entire business model of ABS-CBN can be said to have exploited Filipinos’ freedom to be stupid. The logic of ABS-CBN shareholders, its executive management team, and its fandom-turned-“activists” is almost criminal. If Filipinos are willing to pay good money for crap, that’s just the free market in all its wondrous wisdom at work, is the thinking they apply to running their business. ABS-CBN get their million-peso blockbuster hit and Filipinos get their Pinoy Big Brother fix. Everybody’s happy. The results can be seen today. Even the arguments that are applied to defend its lost “cause” are stupid.
Think of what it would be like if such as a dishonest business as ABS-CBN continue to be allowed to pollute the country’s airwaves and cinemas. Filipinos will keep forking out hard-earned cash to see increasingly mediocre products which big media conglomerates will happily churn out in mind-numbingly vast quantities at enormous profit. Bad content, sustaining bad taste which, in turn fuels more demand for bad content. It would be a doomed society.
Now that ABS-CBN is toast, the opportunities to fill the void it leaves are endless. This is a chance to start from scratch and build a media company that truly serves the Filipino people. For that, we can turn to the experience of the United Kingdom for some inspiration.
Consider the original public service charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The BBC was created by Royal Charter as the state broadcasting monopoly in 1927 under the direction of the 12 members of the BBC Trust. These members are each appointed by the British monarch and while they enjoy complete independence in the running of the BBC, its primary purpose, summarised by John Reith, its first Managing Director, is to “educate, inform, entertain”, a key part of its mission statement to this day.
The BBC remained a television broadcasting monopoly in the United Kingdom from 1927 to 1954 and its monopoly on radio was broken up only as recently as 1972. But even after broadcasting in the UK was opened to competition, the BBC remains the dominant media organisation there and its values have remained largely consistent to its original charter. Public service remains its primary function and today is governed along the lines of the following set of principles:
– Sustaining citizenship and civil society;
– Promoting education and learning;
– Stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;
– Representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities; and,
– Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK.
Furthermore, its current version of the charter demands that the BBC “must display at least one of the following characteristics in all content: high quality, originality, innovation, to be challenging and to be engaging” and that it must “demonstrate that it provides public value in all of its major activities.”
In considering the BBC experience, perhaps there is value in reconsidering the approach to mass communication in the Philippines given the clearly evident immaturity of its society and the formidable challenges the country faces in uplifiting the intellectual faculties of its people.
Broadcast media and cinema continue to be key channels into the minds of Filipinos and a major shaper of culture. To delegate this entire space to the private sector — particularly big corporations driven primarily by profit and by the dishonest agendas of their top shareholders’ golf buddies and former schoolmates is practically criminal. Now that ABS-CBN’s formidable footprint is out of the picture and the landscape ripe for the farming of more intelligent and original work, the Philippines’ prospects of progressing into a truly modern and smarter society look promising.",Others
How celebrity culture in Philippine “journalism” DAMAGED Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/how-celebrity-culture-in-philippine-journalism-damaged-filipinos/,"Take stock of the landscape of “thought leaders” in Philippine society and a large proportion of these would consist of so-called “journalists”. To be fair, this is a profession of people who are in their element writing stuff. But by no means are “good writers” connected with big media brands entitled to monopolise an important space where essential information to support continuous improvement in society is disseminated and exchanged. The trouble is, the media industry are dishonestly leading people to believe that only their community are qualified to compete in that space.
In the last several years since social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have started eating into the mass media market that Big Corporate Media have once monopolised, members of the “journalism” industry have been fighting a desperate battle to save their collective hides. Their livelihoods and social status are now under threat as they find themselves competing for an audience with a multitude of alternatives — people, communities, and businesses who have applied lots of savvy exploiting the now-democratised mass-media space. As such, they had gone as far as campaigning to discredit these alternatives as “fake news” and to extol the virtues of the “journalism” profession and industry that subjects its practitioners to “editorial oversight”.
One particularly dishonest approach the mainstream had taken was to fashion their lot into celebrities. “If a journalist says so, then it must be right.” More disturbing: “If a famous journalist says so, it is gospel.” That is what the industry is trying to drum into people’s heads in the hope of marginalising or even discrediting the community of communicators that are giving the journalism establishment a run for their money. This is the mainstream media applying Brand Management 101 to promoting its products — basically telling people to defer to branding and not to their own better judgments to critically evaluate what these “journalists” are telling them.
Most distubring of all is how Big Corporate Media have made themselves the news. The entire landscape of chatter surrounding “fake news” is itself hinged on the obsolete idea that mainstream media is de facto the “news”. “Fake news” is being framed as the villain and mainstream traditional news channels as the protagonists in a so-called “war versus disinformation”. This “war” is a convenient vehicle for what is effectively a PR campaign to shore up a dying industry.
The question people need to ask of traditional media is a simple one:
Is it still your mission to inform the people?
Clearly, traditional media businesses and practitioners are overdue for some deep introspection. Peter Vanderwicken who was a journalist at Time, Fortune, and the Wall Street Journal in his article “Why the News Is Not the Truth” published on the Harvard Business Review in 1995 wrote…
One consequence of the prevalence of propaganda in the press is that the public’s confidence in all institutions gradually erodes. As people begin to realize that they are being misled, manipulated, and lied to, they resent it. From 1973 to 1993, only Congress fell further in public esteem than the press, according to surveys of public confidence by the University of Michigan. The decline in confidence reflects a widening feeling that the news media are contentious, unfair, inaccurate, and under the thumb of powerful institutions, a 1989 survey by Gallup for the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press concluded.
Vanderbilt also cites fellow journalist Paul H. Weaver’s central thesis in his analysis News and the Culture of Lying: How Journalism Really Works which asserts…
Journalists need crises to dramatize news, and government officials need to appear to be responding to crises. Too often, the crises are not really crises but joint fabrications. The two institutions have become so ensnared in a symbiotic web of lies that the news media are unable to tell the public what is true and the government is unable to govern effectively.
Quite prescient considering these were all written in 1995 — when blogging was in its infancy and long before the advent of social media and the opening of mass communication to anyone with access to the Internet. Back then some scholars were already seeing the beginnings of the news media industry’s crisis of credibility — a crisis that would explode over the first two decades of the 21st Century and see their members flailing for survival. Unfortunately, rather than turn outward and embrace change, Big Corporate Media have turned inward, foolishly dismissed the competition (going as far as painting them as incompetent villains), turned their industry into a circus show, and got even cosier with politicians and traditional “activists”. Indeed, the latter two were their biggest undoing as these two — politicians and “activists” — increasingly became the objects of public cynicism.
Evidently, traditional media had already gone into a fatal downward spiral way before “fake news” was engineered by their industry powers-that-be into the outrage fad that it is today. The result of their desperate gasps for air as they sink into irrelevance is a sad further graying of the line between “news” and entertainment. Scrounging for molehills to make mountains of has only made the business of news “reporting” more akin to an entertainment venture and moves it further away from being the sincere informer of people (or “truth teller”) its captains would like to be perceived as. Most susceptible to the cancer that “journalism” had become are Filipinos who, like their American counterparts, are easily starstruck by celebrity. Business Sense 101 therefore dictates that to capture this market even the “news” needs to be cast with branded stars. This is the state of “journalism” in the Philippines today. That’s Entertainment. It’s a dangerous poison unleashed in a country that scores the lowest in global reading comprehension faculties and one where, in a time of pandemic, staying abreast with the right information is a matter of life-and-death.",Others
Satire piece on Opposition senatoriables for 2022 enrage Frank Baraan and Kakie Pangilinan,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/satire-piece-on-opposition-senatoriables-for-2022-enrage-frank-baraan-and-kakie-pangilinan/,"It was supposed to be just a satirical post — popular blog Adobo Chronicles being, after all, a satire channel. In its piece “Siete palabras: LIBERAL PARTY ANNOUNCES 2022 SENATORIAL LINE-UP” published Saturday, the Chronicles “announced” a “Magic Seven” slate consisting of top Opposition social media “thought leaders”…
The magic seven are ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin, VP daughter Aika Robredo, convict and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa, actress Vilma Santos, blogger Francis Baraan IV, blogger Jover Laurio and Sharon Cuneta’s daughter Kakie Pangilinan.
The Adobo Chronicles prides itself in being “your best source of up-to-date unbelievable news” — a claim that is displayed at its site masthead. Just the same, the fact of it being a satire site still managed to escape the faculties of a number of the illustrious folk of the “Magic Seven”. One of them was the chi chi Frank Baraan, son of notorious former Justice Undersecretary Francis Baraan III, who was quick off the mark to issue his reaction.
In a subsequent tweet, Baraan wonders out loud; “I don’t know how this rumor started, or if this was meant to be sarcastic or funny. But the way the article was written, obviously, the writer is DDS & wants to paint LP candidates as losers,” evidently still none the wise about the satirical nature of the article.
Just as quick to fire off the hip is Her Royal Showbiz Highness Kakie Pangilinan, daughter of Senator and Mrs. Cuneta who, in a tweet, sought to make a clarification known to the madla…
Certainly not much of the sort of sugar and spice and everything nice that one would expect of a nineteen year old scion of Pinoy showbiz and Yellowtard royalty, right?
On a more serious note, one then wonders. The 2022 national elections are just around the corner, which means 2021 will be a campaign year. This episode highlights a grim reality for the Philippine Opposition — the fact that they still have no idea as to what their campaign platform will be and who their presidential and senatorial bets will be. They are up against a popular incumbent and with just months coming into a crucial campaign year, the nearest semblance of a senatorial slate is an Adobo Chronicles satire piece.
The Opposition would be doing itself big favours getting their shit together this early. Current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a very popular political opponent and will likely bring this popularity to bear anointing his chosen successor. With its cornerstone partisan brands — the Yellowtard flag of the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan and the hammer and sickle of the Communist Party of the Philippines — in tatters, the Opposition are hard-pressed to come up with a new narrative that could resonate with Filipinos strongly enough to pose a challenge to the administration camp. So far, it still remains to be seen if its “leaders”, if any, are up to the job at hand.",Others
Racist Yellowtards flipping over Mandarin-language Chinese News TV (CNTV) airing on ABS-CBN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/racist-yellowtards-flipping-over-mandarin-language-chinese-news-tv-cntv-airing-on-abs-cbn/,"Today’s Yellowtard outrage fad surrounds an agreement between the ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) and the firm Horizon of the Sun Communications, Incorporated which produces the iconic lifestyle show Chinatown TV to broadcast Chinese News TV (CNTV). CNTV has been airing nightly with news content delivered in Mandarin since 2017 and its audience traditionally consists of the local Filipino-Chinese community. The deal with ANC is expected to expand CNTV’s reach and expand its audience base.
As expected, members of the Opposition who’ve made anti-Chinese sentiment a cornerstone of their campaign against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (who is cozy with China) are up in arms. Fresh in their small minds is a previous outrage fad following a provocative stunt pulled by “reporter” Chiara Zambrano in the South China Sea in aid of scoop “journalism”. Zambrano seemingly succeeded in baiting a Chinese missile ship to “give chase” to her news crew and provide fodder for a good story. It was successful in the sense of further fuelling anti-Chinese sentiment amongst the Yellowtards (the bloc within the Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan), the ironically-Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines, and their circle of “thought leaders” and “activists”. The shrill anti-China rhetoric of the Yellowtards and how this now extends to the ANC-CNTV project is encapsulated in this tweet issued by Yellowtard Chief Economist JC Punongbayan…
It seems ABS-CBN have become victims of the conflicted ideology of the very woke Yellowtard community who, just a blink ago, rabidly rallied to their ultimately futile “cause” to have their broadcast license renewed. Unfortunately for the broader Opposition, this new outrage fad is likely to alienate influential Filipino-Chinese both within the Yellowtard and communist cliques as well as the swing vote within the broader partisan landscape — not a good prospect considering the unity the Opposition desperately need in the coming 2022 elections to pose a credible challenge to the enormous popularity of the incumbent Duterte camp. ABS-CBN News chief Ging Reyes has since come up with a statement presumably hoping to diffuse this shrill “debate” within the ranks in a tweet thread she issued last night.
I understand the concerns on Chinese incursions in the West Ph sea & many other issues related to the country’s relations with China.  ABS-CBN News has vigorously covered these issues, in our pursuit of truth and public enlightenment. But we resist discrimination against any race or ethnicity.
The airing on ANC of Chinatown News should not be equated with the intrusions in the West Ph Sea. Chinatown News is produced by fellow Filipinos who belong to the Filipino-Chinese community. They are part of Philippine society.  Rather than belittle their attempt to provide a service to their local community, it’s time we considered embracing the diversity of this land we all call home.  We have editorial control over their content, provide national news stories & ensure accuracy of the translation from Mandarin to English subtitles.
Indeed, the whole trouble with the Yellowtards is the retarded emotionalism that they apply to their political rhetoric and obsolete “activism”. Racism is an emotional response to perceived threats that are likely ill-understood. Emotional Yellowtards are evidently unable to distinguish the Filipino-Chinese community from Chinese nationals and even Chinese nationals from their communist government. They latch on to the lazy approach which is to lump “Chinese people” together into a notion that fits their dishonest narrative. That’s pretty much Racism 101 and the Yellowtards are caught red-handed (pardon the pun) guilty of it in this instance. This disturbing character of the Yellowtard-led Opposition likely emanates from their presumptive “leader”, current “vice president” Leni Robredo who, herself, has contributed to anti-Chinese sentiment in the Philippines.
From a business standpoint, it does make sense for a profit-oriented media company like ABS-CBN to cater to the affluent Filipino-Chinese community and the fast-growing base of ethnic Chinese consumers. Ad-slot-for-ad-slot, an affluent audience, after all, attracts better ad revenue. The fact is, the Filipino-Chinese community and the growing community of expat ethnic Chinese and Chinese nationals making a home in the Philippines is a market that ABS-CBN cannot afford to ignore. ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak is under pressure to make up for his botched handling of the political circus that resulted in his company’s loss of its broadcast license and very likely made his shareholders hopping mad. A strong ethnic Chinese audience pound-for-pound delivers more to the bottom line than the impoverished audience that laps up Vice Ganda and It’s Showtime content and Katigbak has probably come around and embraced that fact.
As for the Yellowtards, it is best that ABS-CBN and the Chinese community dismiss these crybabies as an irrelevant political force. Their brand has become a reverse-Midas-Touch to politicians hoping to win in 2022 and distancing themselves from this bloc, its Sino-phobic leader “vice president” Leni Robredo, and the dysfunctional Liberal and Communist Parties that prop up its overused narrative makes perfect strategic sense. The aim is to move forward, embrace change, and welcome diversity and not be held back by one’s childhood fears and the old bogeymen that populate the old-wive’s tales the Yellowtards and commies stubbornly subscribe to.",Others
New Year’s resolution for Yellowtards and Reds: Stop HATING Duterte supporters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/new-years-resolution-for-yellowtards-and-reds-stop-hating-duterte-supporters/,"The year 2021 is an important year. This is because the campaign for the 2022 national elections will transpire over the greater part of this year. As such, an important resolution needs to be made by the Philippine Opposition if they truly aspire to legally seize power in 2022. They must stop hating their enemies and start understanding how they think.
The biggest challenge of the broader Philippine Opposition lies in the character of their “leaders”. The Yellowtards (the leading opposition bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists (the terrorist bloc within it gunning for violent ouster of any Philippine government) dominate the discourse of the Opposition. As a result, the collective discourse most associated with the Opposition has come to be characterised by hate, prejudice, and fundamentalism.
It is hateful because the only thing that “unifies” the Opposition at the moment is an irrational contempt for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his supporters. Unfortunately for the Opposition, it is this very hate that is clouding the judgement of their foremost “thought leaders” and blinding them to any opportunity to anticipate the movements of the forces they seek to defeat. Indeed, there is much to learn from intelligence gathered from behind enemy lines than from any of the shrill powow “rallies” populated by like-minded inbred amigas. However much of the Opposition “leadership” recoil from rather than apply healthy curiousity to their regard for the forces they need to beat. That’s a recipe for failure in any “fight” they see themselves engaging in.
The Opposition rhetoric is also prejudiced against people who think differently. This is ironic because liberals are supposedly advocates of inclusiveness, openness, and diversity. The Yellowtards and communists are anything but. Former president Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III, for example, King of the Yellowtards, rather than stand by the national colours, wore the yellow ribbon throughout his term. The communists, for their part, flew the Hammer and Sickle and bathed their ideological brand in bright red to set their crooked “revolutionary” lot apart from all the rest. In this behaviour, it becomes evident that their intent is to exclude rather than include.
One wonders then what it is exactly that the Yellowtards and communists share in the way of agendas. That makes the overall “leadership” of the Opposition they presume to take jointly suspect. Neither one of these two blocs are known to have ever been inclined to share the spoils of their respective “revolutions”. They’d just as soon slit one another’s throats the minute their shared enemy disappears from the scene.
And then there is the abject fundamentalism in the disturbing Yellowtard and communist character of the Philippine Opposition. The Opposition have a virtual Thought Police force on patrol day in and day out launching one Outrage Fad or another against anyone or anything seen to be heretical to their sacred “liberal” dogmas. They had all but conscripted much of Big Corporate Media to this cancel culture and enjoy the vast resources of this dishonest alliance to mount campaigns to marginalise any challenge to their prescribed schools of thought.
What the Yellowtards and communists seem unable to grasp, however, is how incoherent their axis is and how obsolete their infrastructure of deception had become. Firstly, Yellow and Red, mixed together, form the colour orange which is an apt colour that suits them the most where they are best situated. Yellowtards insist they are “pro democracy” while communists are violently opposed to it. Both worship throwback Cold War ideologies that are no longer relevant in an age where the ability to synthesise diverse thought is so technologically-enabled and effectively democratised that traditional monopolists of information — mainstream corporate media — now find themselves in an acute crisis of relevance. Therein that latter reality is evident the abject obsolescence of the Yellowtards’ infrastructure of disinformation. While the Yellowtards control Big Corporate Media and the communists control traditional university campus “journalism”, the reality of the rapid decline in their influence in the face of competition in the free market of ideas is inescapable.
Thus if the Opposition are really serious about winning back Filipinos, they need to reinvent themselves and ditch the baggage of Yellowtardism and communism that weigh them down. The most viable Opposition leader that needs to emerge in 2021 is one who is not stained by yellow or red and one who comes across as original and authentic. Both these virtues cannot be ascribed to the Yellowtards nor the communists as both are sad and smelly regurgitations of what have now been revealed to be dishonest and nonsensical narratives.
The Opposition in the crucial year that is 2021 need to resolve to get real. Filipinos deserve a real Opposition that can exhibit intelligent leadership. It is high time that the insult to their intelligence that is the Yellowtard- and communist-led one they merely put up with today is junked.",Others
Stories about poverty don’t make lucrative “journalism”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/stories-about-poverty-dont-make-lucrative-journalism/,"One thing today’s Philippine Opposition need to seriously consider is that a cabal of woke “journalists” are among their top “thought leaders” and agents of public relations. This is a problematic situation for parties that aspire to seize power legally in 2022 because these parasitical members of their “cause” are not delivering results where they matter. They are focusing on all the wrong things. Well, actually they are focusing primarily on one thing: poverty. I mean, who wants to read about poverty, right? Such a boring topic. It just doesn’t sell papers and pull in eyeballs. If Opposition politicians really want the sorts of messaging on which they can piggyback their fat asses on, they should consider the work of real investigative journalists — the ones that don’t get invited to chit chat with journalism “professors” in chi chi campus forums at those Katipunan universities.
It’s really not rocket science. All one needs to do is pick up a copy of Abante Tonite, for example. Check out the banner stories on its front cover. Do you see anything there about the “plight” of the “poor”? Think about that and consider what market this product serves. There’s your answer right there. The poor don’t really care about poverty.
What the poor do care about is how to escape poverty. Whining about their “plight” as many woke journalists do does not contribute to that escapism. It only reminds the poor how desperate their situation is. Big help that is, right? The stories represented in that Abante cover by no means offer solutions to poverty. That’s not a problem to poor Filipinos. In fact, they actually pay to read these “unhelpful” stories which says a lot more about Abante‘s value proposition to its audience than, say, Rappler and Bulatlat whose respective editors spend their days begging for suckers to fork out money in exchange for “premium” content or to “support” the cause of chi chi woke “journalism”.
The thing wokedom don’t understand is that the subsets of poor people that can be helped are the ones consisting of folk who, individually, are working on solutions to their personal financial challenges. These don’t care about the “pity” woke “journalists” presume to solicit on their behalf. They’re too busy solving their own personal poverty cases. Of course, not all efforts are successful and a great number of these hard-working poor will remain poor despite their efforts. But, see, ultimately successful or not, the hard working poor regard feeling sorry for themselves as a luxury they can ill-afford to indulge.
And then there are those poor people that just can’t be helped. They are the ones who will continue their habit of entering into commitments they are inherently-incapable of honouring. There’s quite a number of them but their style of palamunin thinking does not represent the attitudes of all poor people. The trouble with woke journalists is that they would like the “more fortunate” to regard the poor as charity cases who can only hope to continue living if the world magically turns into a nice and peachy sharing-and-caring one. In essence, they assume all poor people are of the palamunin sort who’s only aspiration in life is the next ayuda handout. The world, quite simply, does not work like that.
The fact is, woke “journalists” insult the poor with their patronising stories. They thrive on the “retweets” and “likes” from their amigas in the echo chambers they inhabit and use these as medals to hang on their breast pockets to signal their “compassion” for the poor. If anyone hadn’t noticed yet, that’s been the modus operandi of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries. Yet, despite the Catholic clergy one-upping woke journalists’ virtue signalling with their infamous “vow of poverty”, centuries of compassion-for-the-poor branding got the Church jack. Indeed, the two-decade decline of Big Corporate Journalism today practically mirrors the centuries-in-the-making decline of the Roman Catholic Church. That’s a lesson the “journalism” industry need to take to heart.
More importantly, the Philippine Opposition need to recognise the cancer growing in their midst. Like how the small band of really cluey personalities within the Philippine Opposition have recognised that the Church and Yellowtardism are liabilities in their campaign strategies that they need to ditch, it is high time that they cast a similar critical eye on the woke “journalism” infestation their “cause” suffers. Sooner than later, in fact. The 2022 elections are just around the corner. Old habits need to die now na. The clock is ticking.",Others
VERA Files dishonestly blocked a #GetRealPhilippines article about Senator Franklin Drilon on Facebook!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/vera-files-dishonestly-blocked-a-getrealphilippines-article-about-senator-franklin-drilon-on-facebook/,"It’s come to my attention that one of our blog posts on our short-article site Get Real Pundit, “Senator Franklin Drilon momentarily asleep during CNN interview with Pinky Webb” was flagged as “false information” by the Facebook “fact check” Taliban.
As shown in the above screenshot, the article was “checked by independent fact-checkers”, in this case fact-check “partner” VERA Files. The question is, is VERA Files really an independent fact-checker in this instance? We will note that its president, Ellen Tordesillas, is a known rabid supporter of the Philippines’ Liberal Party which Senator Franklin Drilon, the subject of the “offending” article, is a top officer of. In that sense, it can be argued that the claim to being an “independent fact-checker” is questionable at best, and very likely false at worst.
Indeed, VERA Files has long been linked with a media alliance behind a concerted vilification campaign against the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. As such, any position Tordesillas takes on political matters tends to be suspect. For example, back in April 2019, Tordesillas was quick to get behind a series of videos being shared all over social media at the time where a certain “Bikoy” who claimed to be “a former member of a drug syndicate operating in Southern Luzon and Visayas region” presented “evidence” that linked members of Duterte’s family to a “P6 billion” shabu smuggling operation. Tordesilla’s basis for believing the videos? She “observed” that the videos “look professionally done. So is the annotation.”
“Bikoy” turned out to be Peter Joemel Advincula who, according to an ABS-CBN News report is in the list of Naga City’s Most Wanted in 2012 for theft cases in Sorsogon and “is also facing charges of illegal recruitment and large scale estafa in Naga City and Albay”. Advincula was later investigated after he had been outed as the character behind “Bikoy”. In June, 2019, the Inquirer reported that Advincula admitted in an affidavit submitted to the police “after returning to the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group on May 27 for protective custody” to being part of a broader conspiracy mounted by key members of the Opposition to undermine the Philippine government. The affidavit documents Advincula’s claims he met with a number of members of the Roman Catholic clergy as well as former Education Secretary Armin Luistro and that these meetings “centered on how to publicize a story that the President’s allies and family were linked to illegal drugs, to unseat Duterte, and to ensure the defeat of administration-backed senatorial candidates in the recently concluded elections.”
Dubbed, “Project Sodoma,” the supposed conspiracy to undermine and unseat Duterte may have possibly been sanctioned by administrators of the Ateneo de Manila University and could involve the highest officials of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In his 27th May affidavit, Advincula reportedly “claimed that [Archbishop Socrates Villegas of Lingayen-Dagupan and former head of the CBCP] was present at a meeting on Dec. 12 at the Jesuit Residence at Ateneo de Manila University.”
So far, neither Tordesillas nor VERA Files have published any further reports on “Bikoy”.
More importantly, the idea of a discredited “fact-checker” like VERA Files presuming to determine unilaterally what is “false” or not is questionable considering that Tordesillas herself is unable to articulate her own working definition of what “fake news” really is. Back as 2018, shocking revelations of Tordesillas’s dishonesty came to light during a televised discussion about the “partnering” of social media giant Facebook with Rappler and VERA Files. Invited to discuss this “partnership” in the show was Tordesillas and De La Salle University (DLSU) Political Science Professor Antonio Contreras.
Asked by ANC Early Edition host Ian Esguerra what working definition of the term “fake news” will be applied in the “fact checking” work they will be doing for Facebook, Tordesillas stammered out an incoherent thought stream in response. An annotated excerpt of the discussion can be found here. It was quite evident that Tordesillas had no working definition of “fake news” to work with and was merely bluffing her way (unsuccessfully) through Esguerra’s line of questioning.
More disturbing is the idea that one single authority (or an “accredited” cabal of them) can summarily cancel content on Facebook with neither channel to challenge these cancellations nor room for the community of content publishers to police themselves. Indeed, comment facilities are available for all GRP content and readers are encouraged to challenge every assertion we make. In contrast, the clique of “fact-checkers” that VERA Files is part of is an inbred group within which mere beliefs are propagated and amplified and challenges to these summarily dismissed or ignored. I highlighted the bald dishonesty inherent to these cliques and the flawed logic such echo chambers produce in my article “Let us all please FACT CHECK the VERA Files ‘fact check’ on Drilon’s dozing off incident on TV!” where I point out just how crooked VERA Files‘ approach to “fact checking” really is using the Drilon dozing off incident…
It is interesting to note that VERA Files used sources from only one side of the story — that of CNN Philippines and its contracted talent Pinky Webb. It did not even manage to secure a full unedited version of the footage and used a mere “screen grab” to “prove” that Drilon was, over the course of the brief footage, reading off documents on his desk. VERA Files had no third party to corroborate the “evidence” it presents — only itself and CNN Philippines and certain parties under its payroll. It seems VERA Files could not even be bothered to take a statement from Senator Drilon himself.
Furthermore, the footage used in this “fact check” was taken directly from the published and edited version of the interview.
This leads us to wonder how many more articles and how much more information that reveals similar disturbing facts are being suppressed by “fact-checkers” like Tordesillas and her VERA Files organisation. It is indeed ironic that Tordesillas and her ilk including “activists” and “thought leaders” of today’s Philippine Opposition repeatedly remind people to be vigilant and routinely apply critical minds to the information they find on the Net. As it turns out, Tordesillas and her amigas are the biggest offenders. It’s time Filipinos think twice about the trust they put in people like her and the camps she is allied with who claim to be the “decent” mob.",Others
Make no mistake. “Pinoy Weekly” is a COMMUNIST publication!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/make-no-mistake-pinoy-weekly-is-a-communist-publication/,"The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) calls it an “alternative media magazine”. Pinoy Weekly is supposedly a “legitimate news organisation” the NUJP insists in a subsequent tweet. Why then would it be a subject of interest for the Philippine Police who, presumably, are looking out for the safety and security of the Filipino public, they ask.
Interestingly, this “legitimate” news organisation seems to have ready access to the Communist Party of the Philippines’ (CPP) terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.
Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya.
Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows.
Pinoy Weekly is cited as a “member of the Altermidya” in a tweet fielded recently by the official Twitter account of the group as part of a thread that denounces a recent police operation that raided the Bulacan office of squatter advocacy group KADAMAY in Pandi where copies of the publication were seized and a “local urban poor leader” arrested for having these in her possession.
Not surprisingly, a who’s who of top honchos of known communist front groups such as Raoul Manuel, President of the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), have come to the defense of Pinoy Weekly.
Indeed, the police are actually right when they cite being “anti-government” as a chargeable offense. Communists are anti any government other than the “dictatorship of the proletariat” they aspire to install following that violent “people’s revolution” they continuously conspire to incite. They don’t seek a change of leadership within any legal frame and certainly not one framed by the current 1987 Constitution. They seek nothing short of the complete destruction of the Philippine government in its current form. That is the singular mission of the communists. Make no mistake.
Is Pinoy Weekly part of this terrorist network? We’ll leave it up to intelligent Filipinos to connect the dots.",Others
Use of face shields in the Philippines is an OA overreaction,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/use-of-face-shields-in-the-philippines-is-an-oa-overreaction/,"Is it just me, or does anyone else think that the excessive use and prescription of face shields in the Philippines is just another one of those shrill overreactions propagated on the back of the speculation coming from the lockdown-idled minds of millennial “influencers”?
COVID-19 is unprecedented in its place in human history as a dreaded attack disease — or so we were all made to believe. Albeit an actual virus in the conventional sense, COVID-19 seemingly owes its virulence more to the Internet and, more disturbingly, a small clique of shrill voices within it whose uninformed titas exchange the equivalent of modern old wives’ tales about it. But more circumspect notions about it are just quick Google searches away.
According to a report issued by the United States Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the truly fearsome diseases of yore “tend to have high attack rates because they can quickly reach and infect many people in a short period of time”. To put this in perspective, the report asserts, “were SARS-CoV-2 spread primarily through airborne transmission like measles, experts would expect to have observed considerably more rapid global spread of infection in early 2020 and higher percentages of prior infection measured by serosurveys.”
Consider then…
Available data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has spread more like most other common respiratory viruses, primarily through respiratory droplet transmission within a short range (e.g., less than six feet). There is no evidence of efficient spread (i.e., routine, rapid spread) to people far away or who enter a space hours after an infectious person was there.
One wonders then whether the risk of wearing a mask and face shield outdoors, specially when cycling or even just walking on Manila’s chaotic streets, is worth the dubious safety it supposedly provides against spreading or contracting COVID-19.
Specially in the Philippines’ notoriously oppressive humid climate, face shields pose serious safety hazards when one considers how they tend to fog up from the wearer’s own breath and how quickly these accumulate dust and grime from exposure to Manila’s infamous corrosive atmosphere.
Indeed, speculation is rife that someone is profiting massively from the manufacture and supply of these quaint trinkets. This could go towards explaining the bizarre way even showbiz personalities make use of face shields in popular TV programming in the Philippines. One wouldn’t likely be surprised if a massively-funded campaign to glamourise the use of face shields and make them “trendy” in the eyes of the ignoramus fandom of ABS-CBN “talent” Vice Ganda and his ilk is one day uncovered.
For now, it seems Filipinos are happy to be emotionally-blackmailed by their “thought leaders” into wearing these curious costume accessories. It really just takes a mediocre or dishonest product, the audacity to market it, and a million or so suckers willing to pay good money for it to make a fortune in a society of people too lazy to think for themselves.",Others
"Rather than report the news, Rappler makes ITSELF the news",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/rather-than-report-the-news-rappler-makes-itself-the-news/,"Rappler “journalist” Nick Villavecer’s “report” where he sings praises to his own CEO Maria Ressa — a shareholder of his employer — is dishonest journalism because it is a blatant conflict of interest.
In his piece “Attacks and harassment: Women journalists in the Philippines on the cost of truth-telling”, Villavecer cites a number of women “journalists” as paragons of journalistic virtue. That’s not bad by itself except that counted among his list of modern-day Joans of Arc are his colleague Rappler “reporter” Pia Ranada and his boss Rappler CEO Maria Ressa.
But of course, right? Two of the six “women journalists” are Rapplerettes with Ressa listed last but, surely, not the least in Villavecer’s eyes, presumably. Villavecer’s “journalism” is wrong on so many levels. For one thing he is a “journalist” presuming to be an authority on who among his colleagues in the profession are the best of them. One would think that the opinion of a disinterested third party would be a more credible judge. And then forget for a minute that he crowns his peer Ranada as one of the industry illustrados and puts up his own boss in that hall of fame of his own creation. In other more normal circles Villavecer would be called a number of things. Ass-kisser would probably be one that could be used in polite company.
Finally, there’s this whole idea that “journalists” possess the credibility to actually determine who is or who isn’t a “truth-teller”. If there is one crime against decency that Villavecer commits, it is that one. Think about it for a minute — a “reporter” declaring his own media employer a certified “truth-teller”. I don’t think any auditor worth her salt would be amused.
Nonetheless, one of Villavecer’s “women journalists”, the eminent Karen Davila is absolutely chuffed, gushing on Twitter how Villavecer delivers a “beautifully written” piece that she feels “honoured” to be part of.
If I were Davila, I’d think twice about being associated with these crooks at Rappler, much more allowing them to strut around her industry pinning “Truth Teller” medals on who they happen to fancy at the moment.
It seems Maria Ressa and her henchwomen haven’t learned any of the big lessons surrounding the irreversible slide to irrelevance that Big Corporate Media are suffering today.

Opposition “thought leaders” LIE to Filipinos whenever they insist that all trolls are pro-Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/opposition-thought-leaders-lie-to-filipinos-whenever-they-insist-that-all-trolls-are-pro-duterte/,"It’s easy to say that we’re influenced by trolls without understanding basic human psychology and sociology. These sciences focuses on human behavior and its patterns. There are a lot of factors that determine human behavior. But the irony is, now that we have more access to information, the less reliable these are. Disinformation has been in existence since the first newspaper was published. As technology developed, so did disinformation which is basically propaganda. Think Germany in the time of Adolf Hitler. It was easy for Hitler to sell the Germans on Nazism because of the Treaty of Versailles’s onerous terms on war reparations. Before that, there was a the Spanish-American War which had William Randolph Hearst being quoted “you furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war.”
The opposition has painted the administration as the progenitor of fake news. But what of the slew of articles praising PNoy which flooded social media platforms since last week when he died? That’s also propaganda by definition. What of the millennials who don’t bother to read history when it’s at their fingertips? Shouldn’t they be held responsible for the consequence of not doing so? In our time, you either bought what you read or absent the money to do so, you went to the library to read for free.
Inquirer columnist Hyacinth Tagupa in her snootily-titled piece “Guarding our vote from trolls” recommends haughtily, “Don’t feed the trolls.”
As the 2022 elections draw near, these keyboard armies are expected to launch another blitz, if they haven’t already. Sen. Panfilo Lacson recently warned that troll farms are being organized in provinces using taxpayers’ money, in preparation for the upcoming presidential polls.
It’s the height of naiveté to think that only the administration deploys trolls. The Opposition has their own set of the same. Just look at Twitter accounts with a few followers but get thousands of retweets. Chat bots are software-programmed to deliver automated responses. Bots are cheaper than trolls in terms of making a post go viral. It’s automated so the investment is in the development of the bot. But ask a question not programmed into its architecture and that’s the end of the bot. Rather than whine about them, people just need to take a bit more personal responsibility for their regard for the information they consume off social media.
The supreme being gave us the ability to make choices and to be discerning about the choices we make. No bot or troll is in control of our thinking or mindset. It’s all about our discernment. This is why there is the ideological, political and social divides which exist. Then there are those who basically don’t give shit for squat about anything and everything. You don’t get to play in a sandbox with your own rules. It’s up to you to adapt to the environment you find yourself in. It’s easy to whine about trolls but whining will not get you anywhere. In the marketplace of ideas, it’s all about the substance of your thoughts and opinions which matter. Not the trolls or the chat bots.",Others
The KADAMAY mentality of ABS-CBN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/the-kadamay-mentality-of-abs-cbn/,"Despite many Filipinos including former contracted talent moving on with their lives, ABS-CBN continue a melodramatic emotional blackmail campaign to remind the public how “dependent” they are on the network “family” which they market as the brand Kapamilya. Instead of recognising that survival and prosperity as a private enterprise is something one’s management and shareholders are personally accountable for, what their “supporters” are doing is externalising the reasons for their “beloved” corporation’s failure to secure a renewal of their franchise to broadcast. Worse, they are now on a demonisation campaign against former employees and contracted starlets who refuse to join their “cause”.
Former ABS-CBN talent Aljur Abrenica, one of the stars who had already moved on and focused on the future of his career, put it quite well…
“How I see this scenario is the opportunity talaga to cleanse, and the opportunity to get better as a network…”
Patuloy niya, “Every case naman na ganito, may opportunity to make everything better. Yun na lang ang tinitingnan ko.
What ABS-CBN and its supporters are doing, in essence, is no different to how a jilted lover would attempt to split the conjugal network of friends she once shared with her partner into camps. In Tagalog, it is a case of naghahanap ng kadamay. It is good that there are personalities like Abrenica who have a good head on their shoulders and are able to see right through this dishonest game ABS-CBN wants them to play.
Indeed, ABS-CBN insults the talent of these performers by suggesting that they owe their success to the network and not to their inherent abilities as artists and to the work ethic they applied to bulding their careers. Those who have moved on are very likely those who are confident enough in these abilities to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Those who continue to rabidly owe loyalty to the ABS-CBN “family” are as insecure as the losers who fear leaving their mothers’ comfy nest.
The stand Angel Locsin, newly-crowned celebrity “hero” of the ABS-CBN “cause”, on the other hand, encapsulates the toxicity of the network’s vilification campaign…
The “Darna” star decried the silence of her fellow celebrities who are said to be just trying to “look cute on Instagram,” while the network that paved the way for their successful careers is gone.
Locsin’s fans then took this opportunity to bully actress Jane De Leon who happened to be reprising the role of Darna in its television reboot, some of them going as far as suggesting that her career is dead as a result of the stand she takes on joining protest rallies in support of Locsin’s “cause”.
De Leon had earlier “appealed to others to stop being ‘judgmental’ and to quit ‘imposing what others should do according to [their] personal standards and beliefs’.”
We see here the cancerous nature of ABS-CBN’s influence on the values of Filipinos. The network and its rabid supporters contradict the ethic of personal accountability that is vital to the creation of capital through self-reliance and hard work. They are against personal choice and prefer to see their Kapamilya mob toeing the line. Worst of all, they fail to see that their failure was an internal failure — a result of the incompetence and irresponsibility of their executive management team.",Others
Self-crowned “Chief Political Analyst” Antonio Contreras continues to use the Manila Times to promote his lame “voter base” analysis,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/self-crowned-chief-political-analyst-antonio-contreras-continues-to-use-the-manila-times-to-promote-his-lame-voter-base-analysis/,"Surveys as determinants of the shape of one’s voter base aren’t accurate. Why? Think of it for a minute. What if the candidate does not really have a voter base to begin with? As stated in a previous piece, Isko’s voter base is Manila. Grant him the benefit of the doubt and give him the National Capital Region (NCR) for argument’s sake. Though it is one of the most populous regions in the country, it does not mean each and every voter will go for Isko. The same is true with Manny Pacquiao and Grace Poe. The same was true for Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. But in the end, it’s the electricity in the air which an individual with excellent political gut feel will sense that a candidate will win. This was true with Duterte in 2016.
What then is “chief political analyst” Antonio Contreras touting as the middle ground with Pacquiao, Isko and Poe? In his Manila Times piece “Is a Moreno-Pacquiao (or Pacquiao-Moreno) middle ground rising?”, Contreras insists that President Rodrigo Duterte “may not even have the much-touted political firewall that comes with what used to be projected by his loyal DDS [“Die-hard Duterte Supporters”] as his formidable political base.” Contreras goes on to sneer that “he may not even have the assured protection from his daughter [Davao Mayor Inday Sara Duterte] if she runs for president, as her prevailing numbers indicate she is far from being a done deal despite being a frontrunner.” He goes on…
Her 28-percent preference rating for a presidential run stands in the context of an upper limit of a voter base of people willing to vote for her in any position that is only 37.6 percent. And this pales in comparison to the 53.8 percent voter base of Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso. In fact, Pasig City Mayor Victor “Vico” Sotto, while unqualified to run for president, has a broader voter base at 41.5 percent.
I’ve always opined that an Isko – Grace Poe tandem is viable. But as a winner, that’s another thing altogether. Their combined glass ceiling is low. The same is true with an Isko – Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao pairing. That’s an even lower glass ceiling there unless Filipinos prefer entertainment over governance for the next six years.
This is where Contreras fails as a “Chief Political Analyst”. He lacks the experience of being a key player in a campaign for national office. Candidates may win in several different ways. Some will pay to win. Look at Win Gatchalian in 2016. Some will make ex-deals for votes. Look at Joel Villanueva in 2016. But most candidates have a voter base by virtue of their provenance. Franklin Drilon is an Ilonggo. Leila De Lima is a Bicolana. And so on and so forth. For a time, there was a Catholic vote. These sorts of thinking do not hold now in the present context. The Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) vote is still there which is why it has become a ritual among national candidates to win the backing of the INC. Pacman has a voter base in Vis-Min but it does not mean that they will all vote for him. He’s popular as a boxer first. As a politician is another set of criteria in the public mindset.
At this point, the centrist position has been claimed by the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem with their confirmation they are running. A prospective Senate slate has been announced. Contreras is still devoid of political pragmatism because he still can’t see that political parties have been reduced to flags of convenience. Duterte will definitely endorse some of the “NPC” (Nationalist People’s Coalition) candidates. They were also on the list floated the other day. After the election is over, there will be coalition-building again which is a euphemism for switching loyalties in order to get funds for projects and getting pet bills passed.
Contreras seems oblivious to what happened to the candidate he endorsed in 2016. Jejomar Binay lost. His bête noire now is Duterte because of his bitterness. Emotions cloud the judgment of a “political analyst”. One should be both pragmatic and objective if one’s credibility as such is to be established. I wonder how many clients have so far engaged Contreras’s firm so far. They would be throwing good money after bad having him on their team as their principal political adviser. He hasn’t even had the experience of travelling throughout the country specially to the remote regions of the archipelago for him to have a feel of voter sentiment in those places. As the cliché goes, marami pang bigas na kakanin.",Others
Manila Times columnist and DLSU professor Antonio Contreras’s intellectually-dishonest apology for being a former Duterte supporter,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/manila-times-columnist-and-dlsu-professor-antonio-contrerass-intellectually-dishonest-apology-for-being-a-former-duterte-supporter/,"The Chief Political Analyst’s mea culpa is on exhibit on the Manila Times today in Antonio Contreras’s column “Painful cleansing of a political sin”. Contreras writes of the catharsis he experienced watching Mae Paner’s film Tao Po which dramatised the “plight” of the casualties of President Duterte’s “war on drugs”. The film “brutally engaged” him, Contreras writes reflecting on how he once “nitpicked that since we do not have judicial killings as we have outlawed the death penalty, every killing is an extrajudicial killing, in a blatant attempt to delegitimize the seriousness of the allegations against Duterte.”
Academics like Tonton Contreras are such wonders to behold. Despite their educational background, they suffer the most from crises; existential, moral and whatever else is out there. This seems to be caused by fickle-mindedness. He can’t seem to decide up to now, what his principles in life are. Women are naturally fickle-minded. Men are generally not. But not all men are from Mars. Some are from Venus as well…
I am now a person so hated by the diehard Duterte supporters (DDS), even as my friends and colleagues who abandoned me when I was still dining and posing in photographs with the DDS have never fully taken me back. This is just fine, because now I know who my real friends are, and I am now in a much better place – in the political middle, an equal opportunity critic, not blinded by Duterte or Marcos worship, but will not also take hook, line and sinker a Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo.
My short stint in academe has exposed me to a level of fakery I never thought existed among members of this social group. In my time, teachers were respected. They were looked up to because we believed that they were the most knowledgeable since they were teaching us. Woe to those who didn’t make the cut for they were ridiculed. Discipline was the order of the day. This is how we grew up to be the men of today. Granted not all men are created equal but the core characteristics should be there. As one matures, one encounters the harsh realities of life. Exposure is the key. A privileged existence is not available to every Filipino. I learned this at a very early age but it still didn’t prepare me for the poverty I saw in the provinces when I had the opportunity to travel outside of Metro Manila. It is easy to embrace the leftist-militant ideology if you are idealistic at this age. I was. But I didn’t think the answers lay in communism or socialism. I was already a keen student of history then. There is no such thing as a utopia. There will always be cracks in society and those who fall into it, often do by choice. What use is the gift of discernment if we don’t use it?
Contreras is a man who is well-aware of the choices he has made in his life. When he shot to popularity, my first impression of him was good but not good enough even if he was teaching at my college alma mater. Definitely the standards of those who came before him were higher. It didn’t come as a surprise when he became a columnist for the Manila Times. A political analyst should have experience in the conduct of politics and campaigns. It is a science because it involves the study of the political behavior of people. What makes them vote for candidates, what issues are they concerned about, what is going on in their heads when it comes to politics. Eventually the goal is to find out what drives a group of people to vote for a candidate to make him win an election. It is for this reason that political science is a social science.
Contreras wrote glowingly of Jejomar Binay. We all know Jojobama’s background. The obscure Mabini member who wasn’t front and center among the likes of Joker Arroyo, Rene Saguisag, Bobbit Sanchez and Jun Factoran. Binay rose to prominence as the Officer-in-Charge (OOIC) of Makati City. He was the only OIC who did not remove the employees identified with his predecessor. But he also had the advantage of his predecessor, the late Mayor Nemesio “Mesiong” Yabut dying in office at the height of the plot to oust then President Ferdinand Marcos. It would’ve been a different story if Tata Mesiong hadn’t passed and Binay was appointed to replace him. Contreras was part of a group of columnists who did a demolition job on then candidate Duterte. Not for anything but the whole group of prominent Die-hard Duterte Supporter (DDS) bloggers were on the other side of the political fence during the 2016 election. There are at most five of them who were for Duterte from the beginning. The rest, like Contreras, switched sides after Duterte won.
Contreras can claim good faith all he wants but he is not entitled to the benefit of any doubt because he always had malicious intent from the beginning. He is no different from Gideon Lasco who also had to do a mea culpa the other day on a tweet saying that he “should have opposed Duterte unequivocally in 2016, as I have consistently done so over the past 5 years.” Whatever. Leftist-liberals or liberals per se supporting a candidate who was more a leftist-militant than liberal, who was born at a time when misogyny was the rule rather than the exception in a society where matriarchs were dominant — go figure that one out. That’s another social science altogether which is anthropology and sociology, which Randy David specializes in.
“Political analysts” are a a dime a dozen nowadays but not all have the natural talent for it. Politics in the Philippines are closely tied in to business and the two go hand-in-hand. This is where Contreras fails because he has never run a political campaign at even the local level. Surveys don’t make much sense until the seasoned political analyst translates the data into the big picture. The truth is Contreras makes an excuse for his critical collaboration with Duterte, something which the President is unaware of as Contreras was mostly dealing with the underlings in the persons of Martin Andanar and Lorraine Badoy. We have balimbings (two-faced characters) for public intellectuals in the same manner we have politicos who are such as well. Contreras just wants to go back into the arms of his bohemian chi-chi leftist-liberal friends such as Inday Espina Varona, Mae Paner and others who fancy themselves part of the social intellectual elite of this country. What Contreras will not admit to is he wants his 15 minutes of fame which he believes he was unfairly denied by the administration and the DDS. This is usually the fate of mercenaries and Contreras was the one who made his bed. He should be used to lying on it by now.",Others
ABS-CBN is the biggest TROLL FARM of them all: no place for it in Philippine democracy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/abs-cbn-is-the-biggest-troll-farm-of-them-all-no-place-for-it-in-philippine-democracy/,"In the dumbing down of the Filipino people. That is what ABS-CBN has been doing since its revival in 1986. No less than the national artist for literature, F. Sionil Jose, has written about the subject several times. It has also been described as the largest political party in the country for its ability to influence election outcomes. It is ironic that it is being defended up to now by leftist-militant groups which are supposedly against oligarchic rule.
Philippine politics is largely hypocritical in nature. There are no principles at stake whatsoever. There are no permanent enemies, only permanent interests to be protected. Certain politicians have been harping about trolls the past weeks. But wasn’t ABS-CBN the biggest troll of them all even before the advent of social media? Proof is how its broadcast anchors have managed to win elective office. Noli de Castro as Senator and Vice-President. Loren Legarda as Senator and Ted Failon as Congressman. There are other lesser known talents who won at the local level in the past and there will surely be more in the future.
Laban Kapamilya is their battle-cry, and for what? Aren’t their owners cognizant of the natural consequence of their dipping their fingers in politics? The position of the Lopezes has always been that they are bigger than the country. During their glory days they threw the most lavish parties Philippines high society have ever seen. This was a demonstration of power and a display of wealth. They have lorded it over the county since the end of World War II. Fernando Lopez was then presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos’s running mate during his first term. He won as Vice-President.
Press freedom and freedom of speech are not dead as the Opposition claims. The President has been under attack since he was a candidate. It will not stop until he steps down. It might not even stop altogether. As Filipinos, it is our duty as citizens to see through this charade. We are smarter than this. We don’t deserve to be dumbed down by the inane programs of ABS-CBN.
There was a time when it still had balanced programming. But in its desire to maximize profits it has solely catered to the masa and dumbed them down even more. This is an indirect control mechanism which gives ABS-CBN and the Lopez’s power over the country through the people they claim to serve. This is also why journalism is a joke now. What used to be a noble profession has been flushed down the toilet and now lives in the sewers. Worse, journalists today also fancy themselves as “activists” and they make known which side they are on and work that into their reportage. However, it is not their place to be doing such things. It is the public who are supposed to form their opinions, not them.
ABS-CBN was a victim of its own machinations. It played the game and lost. That’s not on the government or the people. It’s on them. It’s best that they be content with what’s left of their network and not appeal to the emotions of the public. This doesn’t work anymore. The Opposition wants us to believe that we are in an authoritarian, tyrannical and fascist dictatorship. You only have to listen to the noise generated by media to realize this is false. Instead of casting the Philippines in a positive light, they are doing the opposite with their black propaganda campaign. How then is this being of service to the Filipino? This is the question we should ask ourselves.",Others
ABS-CBN is not worth being made into an election issue because Filipinos couldn’t care less about it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/abs-cbn-is-not-worth-being-made-into-an-election-issue-because-filipinos-couldnt-care-less-about-it/,"Talk about much entitlement! All these actions just for ABS-CBN to be granted a new franchise? It should be an election issue? Former Inquirer editor John Nery is surely earning his keep as a mouthpiece of the Lopezes. In his piece “ABS-CBN is a campaign issue”, Nery continues to harp about how the ABS-CBN’s franchise to broadcast was supposedly the result of “a political decision” and, therefore, “should have political consequences”. Nery is evidently fuming and is out for political blood…
But taking offense is not enough; the pushback against the 70 perpetrators of what I and others have called “legislative murder” should not be left to chance. There is an ongoing signature campaign to justify a people’s initiative to enact a law granting the ABS-CBN network a new franchise; there are some two million Bayan patrollers—the citizen journalists trained by the network over the years; there are many millions of new subscribers to the different ABS-CBN channels online. These and other supporters of the network can be harnessed to make the politicians who voted unfairly on the franchise issue face political consequences.
Then again, we are in the midst of a pandemic and one must do what one has in order to survive. Let’s take a look at it from the opposite point of view. Can we honestly believe that majority of our lawmakers would have necessarily followed President Rodrigo Duterte’s instructions to Congressmen and Senators not to give ABS-CBN a new franchise? ABS-CBN had the widest reach among all networks in the country. Would these politicians have been willing to shut down a platform which is beneficial to them? Let’s assume that their pork barrel allocations were held like the Sword of Damocles above their collective heads, wouldn’t it be in their nature to make this public since it would tilt public opinion in ABS-CBN’s and their favor? Why is it they remained silent? Were there massive amounts of pork barrel allocations dangled to these lawmakers in the same manner former President Noynoy Aquino (PNoy) bribed Senators during the impeachment trial of then Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012 to get the verdict he wanted? At that time, Mar Roxas served as the counduit between the President and the Senators.
Why should ABS-CBN be an election issue? News dissemination hasn’t been affected. ABS-CBN continues to operate on digital platforms although its revenues have been reduced drastically. This is a natural consequence of the politicking they indulged in at their peak. What actually did them in was their hubris. It wasn’t Duterte on his own. Nery is disrespectful of the Filipino voter if he believes that they are this stupid to fall for his asinine suggestion. PNoy did more to not have ABS-CBN’s franchise renewed during his administration than Duterte ever did during his incumbency. Despite an all-out media campaign at the height of the hearings in Congress, ABS-CBN did not get the support it  needed from the public. There were no massive protests. Even the Left couldn’t muster the numbers. This, despite Angel Locsin being front and center, at the rallies held for the network.
Nery should really have his head examined. There are far more pressing issues the electorate need to be concerned with than ABS-CBN. Perhaps a survey should be undertaken by ABS-CBN itself if it hasn’t done so yet. How many Filipinos are in favor of a new franchise for the network in the service of dumbing down the Filipino?",Others
Red Alert! Yellowtards and communists up in arms over Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/red-alert-yellowtards-and-communists-up-in-arms-over-toni-gonzagas-bongbong-marcos-interview/,"Today, the Yellowtards and communists are having a cow over the latest outrage fad being spun around Toni Gonzaga’s interview of former Senator Bongbong Marcos on her YouTube show ToniTalks.
Why is wokedom all hopping mad about this? It is because they are offended by the notion that a popular celebrity whose YouTube channel Toni Gonzaga Studio boasts more than four million subscribers is “giving a platform” to the “dictator’s son”. “Activist” Katrina Stuart-Santiago went on a tililing rampage on Twitter to explain to us “why this is a problem”.
To people like Stuart-Santiago, it is unfair of Gonzaga to be featuring Marcos on her show even if she’s had Yellowtard politicians like Vice President Leni Robredo in the past. That’s because, according to Stuart Santiago, the “Marcoses and Villars are already spending money (on the back of the people) for propaganda. Lamang na sila to begin with. Walang fairness dito.” It seems to escape her that the Opposition enjoy the backing of ABS-CBN and the Inquirer the country’s biggest media conglomerate and its most widely-circulated newspaper respectively. If that isn’t an unfair advantage long enjoyed by the Opposition, what is?
Evidently, the Opposition are all sore over their continued failure to put out a leader possessing enough charisma and gravitas to attract the favours of the Filipino public. Robredo, the personality perceived to be (or what tradition dictates to be) their “leader”, consistently languishes at distant fourth or fifth places in various surveys conducted by reputable polling firms over the last several years. Clearly, the Opposition are unable to put forth a better proposition that resonates with Filipinos.
How much simpler can one put it? To engage Filipino voters, you have to show how you can do things better. Today’s Opposition still don’t get it, however. To them, winning an election is all about convincing Filipinos that the incumbent or bogeyman of choice sucks. They do this by creating and latching on to one or another outrage fad every week — be it a video leaked of the Presidential Spokesperson “berating” a bunch of doctors, an audit finding midway through a standard reporting cycle, or rich people doing what rich people do and making it all about how the current administration does not give out enough ayuda. This week it is Gonzaga’s Marcos interview.
This sort of trial-and-error negative campaign approach insults the intelligence of Filipino voters and, as such, it is no wonder that the Opposition are so far failing to gain any traction with the public. They remain fixated on blatant attempts to distract voters from the fact that the Opposition don’t have anything to work with — no charismatic statesmanship, no leader, no platform — in short, no value proposition. The Opposition — and I mean just about every party across the non-admin board and the personalities they put forth — are an empty shell of form within which rings not much more than hollow rhetoric. How much more can be squeezed from obsolete signalling of one’s “care for the poor”, outrage over “corruption”, and grandstanding of inconsequential ambag initiatives that lack scale? But this is exactly the sort of thing we see being spewed by Opposition “thought leaders” that is amplified by their cronies in Big Corporate Media.
Surely Filipinos deserve something a bit more than rhetoric that paints them as perpetual victims. There are lots of Filipinos who would like to see options that describe what the Philippines could be and, perhaps an even greater number who are sick of being told what a leader should not be. The Opposition can shout out “Never Again!” ’til the cows come home. But until the Yellowtards and communists learn to show Filipinos what can be rather than what should “never” be “again”, they will continue to suffer catastrophic election losses. To the wokedom of today’s Opposition: Learn to be better instead of cancelling people like Toni Gonzaga.",Others
Any investigation on gov’t “troll farms” should also include an inquiry into the dishonest practice of “journalism” by mainstream media,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/any-investigation-on-govt-troll-farms-should-also-include-an-inquiry-into-the-dishonest-practice-of-journalism-by-mainstream-media/,"Joel Ruiz Butuyan in his Inquirer piece “The defeat of the trolls” writes of “strong suspicion that the current government employs so-called troll farms.”
The ongoing Senate investigation has uncovered that the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) pays 1,479 “contract of service employees.” There’s a strong feeling that these are trolls hired by the government, so the Senate is absolutely on the right track by asking the PCOO to submit their addresses, educational attainment, daily time record, and job description.
Martin Andanar has never been the sharpest tool in the comms toolbox of the government. Five years and he hasn’t achieved much improvement in government communications. But the Senators should also haul mainstream media to the Senate for an investigation into violations of the basic tenets of journalism. Mainstream media is biased against the administration. It seldom happens that you’re able to read anything that leaves the reader to form an opinion. It’s made for the reader. Their reporters and anchors are the same. The environment is simulated to go back in time as if we’re under a dictatorship when in fact, we’re not.
Despite her best efforts, Maria Ressa has only been able to fool her Western colleagues about her fight for “freedom”. She hasn’t directly made a statement about the corporate structure of Rappler and why it is fortunate enough to receive grants from American non-government organisations (NGOs) that are known CIA fronts. No self-respecting journalist has bothered with an in-depth report on Rappler‘s finances; primarily how it has been able to continue operations while incurring losses. Its stockholders don’t seem to run out of cash to infuse in this “social news network”.
While they’re at it, the Senators should also invite Ellen Tordesillas of Vera Files, another recipient of grants from the same NGOs that Rappler has received monies from. By law they should register as foreign agents. No one knows if they’ve complied with this requirement. The Opposition will never admit it but they also operate troll farms. You just need to check the accounts on Twitter with limited followers that get retweeted hundreds if not thousands of times. Our Senators should also be aware of bots. Nowadays you can build bots using readily-available software. They’re designed to perform single or multiple functions. They were primarily deployed by the Opposition for mass reporting of pro-Administration Facebook accounts and pages. The pro-Opposition trolls also took down the Mocha Uson network. That was really a for profit operation using the pay-per-click model. All that showed that the number of likes or followers of a page does not necessarily convert into votes. The then PCOO Assistant Secretary failed to land a party-list seat in Congress.
The problem with the Opposition in the Senate is their hypocritical stand on issues. The ongoing circus with Pharmally is an example of how not to conduct an investigation in aid of legislation. Mainstream media just goes along because we now have “journalist-activists” in our midst. They are not objective but subjective. They campaign against the government on social media with their personal accounts. This bastardizes the system because the so-called fourth estate is supposed to be the moderator between government and the public. What they don’t realize is this can also backfire. The public takes sides on the same bases. Those who see through the deception gravitate towards the administration. Those whose biases are confirmed go for the opposition. The lack of an issues-based discussion leaves the public at a disadvantage because it opens them up to exploitation by unscrupulous politicians.
It is, however, obvious to the public who the enemies are. You have the liberal-leftist-militant cabal in politics and media which continue to spew propaganda. It is for this reason that they cannot win elections anymore. Butuyan would like to think that they have the advantage going into 2022 with majority of the voting population between 21-45. He writes…
There’s a whiff of the spirit of the 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution in the air with the crescendo of dissent in all social media platforms. If the youth ride the tide of dissent that’s fast gaining strength in cyberspace, they may yet have their generation’s peaceful revolution come May 2022.
We have seen how voters interest in the election is high. They have gone out of their way and put up with the difficulties of registering to vote for the first time or activating their voter registrations even if they have to wait for long hours in line. No surprise because we’re at a crossroads again because of the pandemic. The opposition should at least have the decency to accept the people’s judgment if they lose on May 2022. We’ve seen how they can be sore losers since the time of former Presidents Joseph “Erap” Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and most recently with Duterte in 2016. Perhaps we should get it down in writing that if they lose, they will stop with their destabilization efforts and work towards nation-building with whoever who is elected.",Others
“Professor” Antonio Contreras’s tantrums are symptomatic of what led to the demise of the original “DDS Bloggers” of 2016,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/professor-antonio-contrerass-tantrums-are-symptomatic-of-what-led-to-the-demise-of-the-original-dds-bloggers-of-2016/,"Constantly amazed  by his logic. A political scientist with a PhD who reasons as he does should be stripped of his doctoral degree. Surveys are based on science because the discipline of statistics is involved. As such, there is the survey design made by a statistician or a data analyst. It has to be totally random in order for the results not to be skewed. If skewed then the purpose of the survey is defeated. Antonio Contreras in his Manila Times piece “A wrong reading of the surveys” screams about how “the recent Pulse Asia Survey” was taken as “an early coronation of the Duterte-Duterte tandem” by “practically every media outfit”. He writes his rebuttal to that interpretation…
To label 28 percent and 18 percent voter preferences as an overwhelming and formidable show of support is absurd. And if the Dutertes are truly powerful as a brand, it would have been simply impossible the President’s much-touted 90 percent trust and approval ratings can just vanish and now become a pitiful 18 percent preference, as if a DDS who worships Duterte can opt to vote for someone else as his vice president.
…and then cleverly inserts his plug writing how, “[our] own survey in DigiVoice, when read parallel with the Pulse Asia survey, in fact could complete the dire picture which this much vaunted political dynasty may be facing. Because we did not measure voter preference relative to specific positions, but only the extent of the voter base of potential voters for a particular candidate in any position, our survey provided a measure of the extent of the potential electoral power of any political brand. Sara Duterte had only a 37.6 percent voter base, while her father, 34.2 percent. Thus, while their numbers reflected in the Pulse Asia survey of 28 percent and 18 percent respectively can still improve, it is possible such may not go beyond their voter bases.”
Not all surveys are correct, of course. Think of Hillary Clinton’s pollsters who had her leading by 10 points in the 2016 election. Election night had Hillary losing to Donald Trump in what was considered a major upset. Last night, I read an article about a statement made by the national group of pollsters in the US saying they made a mistake in their surveys for Congressional races. This is why the Republicans were able to cut down the majority of the Democrats in 2020. They appear to be headed to victory in this year’s midterm election. Bad news for the administration of President Joe Biden.
The problem with Contreras is he lets his hatred of Duterte get in the way of his analysis. He continues to insist that Duterte has a voter base of only 18% per their survey. But the problem with this is the sample size is only 1,500 out of a possible 60M voters. It doesn’t mean that if Duterte ran for Vice-President he would only get 18% of the vote. The same is true with his fallacious claim with Manila Mayor Isko Moreno’s voter base being at 53%. If the election were held today, would it be guaranteed that Isko would win?
Again, surveys are just snapshots to extract information from the electorate. Aside from the science, there is also the gut feel. You want to get the pulse of the people you talk to the man on the street. You want their palpable opinion, you talk to a taxi driver or a barber. Why? They’re the most updated on political issues on account of their jobs having them tuned-in to AM radio to pass their time while doing their work over the course of a day. Contreras wants his followers to swallow his pronouncements as gospel truth while engaging in credentialism. Tag-diez na nga ang mga political analyst at strategist ngayon. Everyone who is on social media is one because they can’t avoid expressing their opinion. That’s what social media is for to begin with. In Contreras’s case, it appears more to be sour-graping given his history of what he refers to as “critical collaboration.” In reality, he’s just pissed that he doesn’t have the same kind of popularity his fellow “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) have now.
In social media, content is king. It’s a question of where you want to position yourself as a pundit. While likes and followers are indicators, what you write about still counts, more so the logic of your argument. What ails Contreras is the same with the Opposition; they like to ram opinions down people’s throats. Unfortunately for those sorts, each individual has the freedom to choose. There is also discernment. No one has the right to force any one to become a believer. You have to sell your ideas in the marketplace. If people buy it, good. If not, then it simply means that your reading of their sentiments is wrong.
It’s now up to you to decide how you will position yourself in the market. Respect begets respect. It’s fairly obvious that the good professor is afflicted with narcissism. He behaves like a six year old whenever anyone disagrees with his opinion. Being a control freak doesn’t get you anywhere. As early as October 2016 when Contreras and the other members of what became the DDS bloggers got together, I already foresaw they wouldn’t last long enough because each and everyone had a hidden agenda. It would become a game of one-upmanship. By 2017, they were already at each other’s throats. This is what happens when your beliefs aren’t based on principles. Contreras’ piece today is a reflection exactly of how he thinks.",Others
"BUSTED! Rappler, Vera Files, @1Sambayan possibly in cahoots to demonise Duterte, China over WPS natural gas BILLIONS!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/busted-rappler-vera-files-1sambayan-possibly-in-cahoots-to-demonise-duterte-china-over-wps-natural-gas-billions/,"Busted. Again. The former Ambassador is really a thorn in the side of the Yellowidiots. In his latest Manila Times piece “Aquino official behind US firm spreading fake news on Chinese activities in SCS”, Bobi Tiglao writes of former Aquino official Peter Anthony Abaya whose last posting in the government of former President Noynoy Aquino, Tiglao writes, “was as general manager of the National Reclamation Authority.”. Abaya is also “the brother of Aquino’s former transportation and communications secretary, Joseph Abaya.” According to Tiglao’s source, Abaya is director in the Florida-based firm Simularity Corporation which was “contracted by the US State Department to set up a ‘South China Sea Rapid Alert Forum,’ its platform for manufacturing anti-China propaganda using its interpretations of satellite images.”
Tiglao goes on to cite a number of “devious propaganda projects” that Simularity perpetrated to effect “body blows on China’s image in the South China Sea”. He then goes into detail on its most recently-manufactured hoax where “its CEO itself Elizabeth Derr in a Zoom conference on July 12, 2021 (on the anniversary of the arbitral ruling) hosted by former Foreign Affairs secretary Albert del Rosario announced that Chinese ships were dumping human feces in the South China Sea ‘so much you can see it in space’.”
While it did not caption the photo as a Chinese ship, Similarity obviously calculated that some stupid Filipino media outfit would conclude that it was so. The online version of GMA 7 in fact did. An alert netizen however reverse-searched the photo and discovered that it was an image of an unidentified ship dumping waste in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 2014.
It was only then that Simularity tried to excuse itself, saying that it clearly captioned the image as that of an “unknown ship,” and that GMA 7 was an “irresponsible news organization.”
https://twitter.com/manuellvillegas/status/1414915177279938564
For one, it’s common knowledge that ocean-going vessels discharge waste into the open seas while in transit from one destination to another. Why would China go to the effort of dumping human waste from the mainland onto the South China Sea? As we wrote about in our previous articles, the tandem of Retired Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario have been acting not for the Philippines but for their patron, Manny Pangilinan in the furtherance of his interests in Recto Bank. The US will not stop in its vilification campaign against China because it wants to remain the top dog in keeping control over the global economic order.
This is why we have several media outlets being funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) such as Rappler and Vera Files. The NED is a known front of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Rappler and Vera Files are identified with the opposition and acting in consonance with Pangilinan’s media companies which include TV5, Philstar and Business World. It’s also able to finance Rappler and Vera Files through advertising agreements. Back in mid-2019, Tiglao wrote in his piece “US govt funding for anti-Duterte media: P74M” presented the following infographic that illustrates this crooked money trail…
Vera Files, Tiglao wrote back then, “got P6.5 million from NED for its 2016 and 2017 funding and P2.2 million from Asia Foundation, which has also been alleged to be a conduit for CIA operations to mold the minds of a target population. It got an additional P750,000 from the NGO Reporters without Borders, which is also funded by NED.” As for Rappler…
With Rappler in the past two years being reported in US media as Duterte’s most vociferous critic in media, NED probably got a State Department order for it to give Rappler money, which it did last year, amounting to P7.5 million. It was a lifeline that it would be getting regularly, as Rappler’s funds from two US firms had been used up fast.
The NED funding was disguised as a grant to it for a project tilted “Understanding and Addressing Disinformation’s Impact on Democracy.” That’s so ironic as it was Rappler that first spread the vile disinformation that the police had killed “7,080” from July 2016 to January 2017 in the government’s war against drugs. The anti-Duterte media here and in the US used that figure to extrapolate very falsely that by 2018, there were “21,000” killed in the anti-drug war — 7,000 multiplied by three (years).
Tiglao points out, “these outfits are violating the constitutional ban on any foreign participation in media, with recent laws unequivocally classifying internet-only news websites as media. The Securities and Exchange Commission had ruled that anything less than ‘100 percent’ control violates the Constitution.” Taken together, they constitute a vast landscape over which huge funds are transferred from one dishonest pocket to another. The NED-CIA outfit has likely gone further by also funding 1Sambayan with Carpio as lead convenor. This has led former Solicitor-General Florin Hilbay to question why Carpio is now the country’s foremost expert on the South China Sea dispute.
The other organizations in the Pangilinan-Del Rosario stable include the Stratbase-ADR Institute and the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative. These outfits continuously churn out negative propaganda about President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration. It is safe to assume that they have the tacit support of the US government which needs a friendlier administration in place for the US to establish bases in the country again. The Anderson Air and Naval base in Guam is three hours flying time away. Access to former US air and naval bases in the Philippines is less-costly and enable faster turnaround times for US Navy Carrier Battle groups now operating in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
Filipinos should not allow Carpio and Del Rosario to pull the wool over their eyes. We cannot be on the wrong side of a shooting war between the US ans China. History has taught us this during World War II. US priorities changed and instead of spending to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war, the US gave us “independence” while keeping their bases rent-free. The total claims by the Philippines against Japan amounted to $8 billion at that time. The US only had Japan pay $800M and this wasn’t even in cash. It also forced the Philippines to sign the Treaty of San Francisco in 1957 which formally ended the Pacific War. It cannot be said that the President is not protecting Filipino’s interests in the position he has taken vis-a-vis China and the US. This is opposed to what Carpio and Del Rosario have been pushing for which is not for Filipinos but for only one individual Filipino.",Others
Philippine Opposition candidates fear “troll armies” because they lack the courage to COMPETE for domination,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/philippine-opposition-candidates-fear-troll-armies-because-they-lack-the-courage-to-compete-for-domination/,"Why blame “trolls” only on the administration? The good versus evil narrative doesn’t sell anymore. The proof of the pudding is in the eating as the maxim goes. If Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte didn’t achieve anything in the last five years, do you think he would still be popular even with his vaunted “troll army?” The opposition maintains they don’t have trolls. Yeah right. The pattern is more evident on Twitter to which they shifted to as their base after their defeat in 2016. They turned it into their own ecosystem. But this isn’t the case anymore.
Administration supporters have made the move to Twitter in the last three years. Why? Facebook has become the den of asininity. The algorithm immediately adjusts to the last thing you searched for. You can’t even get the news in your news feed anymore. Twitter’s algorithm is more balanced. It shows promoted tweets but not in the “in your face” manner of Facebook. It has also evolved to allow threads after increasing the character count of each tweet. It would be perfect if it allowed the editing of a tweet for typos. Twitter also allows the development of an organic following unlike Facebook where you have to pay in order to gain followers. Prior to monetization, Facebook likes and shares allowed one the capability to increase follower count by at least a thousand per week. I know this from actual experience.
As for the claim that the public is being unduly influenced by “trolls”, PhilSTAR columnist Andrew Masigan gives them too much credit in his piece “Understanding the inner workings of trolls” where he writes about the proliferation of “troll armies” that give administration candidates “an advantage”.
I have come to know the inner workings of trolls from first hand experience as an inquiring client. A messaging agency quoted me P5 million for a 30-day messaging campaign. When hired, the messaging agency contracts professional trolls who, in turn, manage their own army of “smurfs.” The more smurfs, the higher the fees of trolls, but rates start at P60,000 per month. The majority of smurfs consist of students and idle housewives. The smurfs typically operate ten accounts each. They are recruited by trolls and given a weekly allowance to spread the propaganda. Bonuses are given for a quota of “likes” and comments. This is why smurfs and trolls goad the public to engage. The budget dictates the number of trolls to be deployed in a campaign.
A script, however, can’t give you the spin on the story in such a way that the public would believe it even if you tailor the message for the demographic. What still sells is analysis based on facts and logic. There are those who brazenly mislead the public. This is outright propaganda and can be found mostly on YouTube. Ironically, mainstream media is also guilty of this with the prevailing fad among journalists of fancying themselves as “journalist-activists.” Reporters don’t report the news based on facts anymore. There has to be color or spin to it, or worse, their own opinion, which results in the editorialization of the news.
Media outlets are also in a bind because it’s expensive to promote their content on social media platforms. But public preference is still based on what the individual actually believes in. The editorial keel of the organization is what drives the individual to bookmark the URL. This is where the influence of the oligarchs come in. The Inquirer and the Star are pro-opposition. The Tribune is pro-administration while there are the in-between such as the Standard and the Manila Times.
I don’t buy into Masigan’s claim that the Opposition is the underdog. The Opposition disadvantaged themselves against the administration because they have no concrete proposition to offer the public due to their being oblivious to how the voter preferences have changed since 2016. Their defeat in 2019 was another wake-up call which they ignored. This is why they are the “underdog” and why theirs is a lost cause.",Others
PhilSTAR journalist Joel Pablo Salud wants F. Sionil Jose’s national artist distinction REVOKED just because their opinions differ,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/philstar-journalist-joel-pablo-salud-wants-f-sionil-joses-national-artist-distinction-revoked-just-because-their-opinions-differ/,"Fair-weather friendship is what PhilSTAR lifestyle writer Joel Pablo Salud exhibits in his recent Facebook post where, to highlight how close a friend he was to national artist F. Sionil Jose, writes about how he had “spent a night in his home in QC, tasted Tita Tessie’s cooking, and enjoyed untold number of hours listening to his stories”. But then…
My doubts began when he first wrote “Duterte’s Revolution” at the beginning of the President’s term. I confronted him with it, first during a visit to Solidaridad, then during our trip to Rosales. On the way there, he sounded as if he had a change of mind, hence I took his word for it.
The friendship whizzed and tumbled and finally came to an end after he wrote his piece on the closure of ABS-CBN. I wrote a piece countering his own, and emailed it to him first out of courtesy to the old man. When he refused me the dignity of an answer, I posted the piece online.
When news of our retrenchment from Graphic reached him, he emailed me and asked if my wife and I were okay–like nothing ever happened. I find that absolutely weird. This time, I refused to give him the courtesy of a reply.
Salud’s hate for his old friend is such that he writes, “the National Artist title still belongs under the purview and funding of the Office of the President. Maybe it’s time we change all that. How? Your guess is as good as mine.” Who does Salud think he is? The National Artist for Literature worked hard for him to be accorded that honor. But aside from that, one does need talent in order to become a writer of Sionil Jose’s stature. What is wrong about writing about the current issues of the time? Voicing an opinion is freedom of expression. Every one has a right to do so. The latest claimed wrong done by the national artist to the “editor in-chief” is his view about the death of Kerima Tariman. If you read Sionil Jose, you will realize that he had the tendency for socialism during his youth. This was the result of his background as the child of farmers in Rosales, Pangasinan. Unlike most Filipinos whose goal is to cross over to the other side of the social divide, Jose doesn’t have much material wealth to show for his achievements. There is his book store Solidaridad alone and the royalties from his books.
I have never formally met him but I have seen him up close whenever I was invited to one of Ramon Orlina’s soirees in Manila or his hometown of Taal. Last May when Salud let loose one of his crybaby diatribes, I was surprised to find a message and friend request from Jose on Facebook. In his message, he thanked me for a piece I wrote defending him against that diatribe. Being the gentleman that he is, Jose wrote in his message that he wished that I had been “kinder” to Salud in my writing and offered to send me his favourite books. I picked up the books from Solidaridad. Prior to this, I never read any of his novels but followed his column in the Philippine Star.
When he changed his opinion about President Rodrigo Duterte after the issue of former President Ferdinand Marcos’s burial and began criticizing the President, I didn’t find it fitting to write about it. When he wrote a scathing piece against Chinoys during the heated debate about Duterte’s foreign policy shift and his closeness to China, my reaction was the same although it was obvious that he was going to take a lot of flak for it.
There is such a thing as agreeing to disagree to begin with. But more importantly, there is also not professing blind obedience to anything or anyone. You’d be a fool if you don’t see through the issues about the non-renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise or the social transgressions of the Lopez family. The same is true with the Communist Party of the Philippines, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army, and its “legal” front, the National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF). The Left has flirted with every post-Marcos President. Duterte appointed three of their leaders to Cabinet Departments. We all know what happened to the peace talks in Oslo. Perhaps this is why we fail as a nation. There is not much room for objective analysis.
Salud goes on to describe the national artist as grasping at straws, implying that he has become what is in the vernacular as “patay-gutom.” Who is patay-gutom? The man who stands by the principles of his beliefs or the man who associates himself with another in order to gain a measure of fame and stature as he himself admits? Is Kerima Tariman a legitimate heroine or is she just a propaganda tool for the communists? I don’t see Salud and his ilk living in poverty. It is easy to bandy the books you have read but it’s another for you to prove that you actually understood the message the author is trying to convey to the reader. The national artist has written about the prostitution of journalism in the past and of how journalists have become mercenaries in their own right. Independence comes at a high price for journalists because it means going against the establishment by writing about the truth. Take a cold hard look at journalism today and you will realize that objectivity has been thrown out the window. This is the first tenet of journalism which is taught to those who aspire to practice the profession. What is happening now is most practitioners have become mouthpieces for opinions which need to be sold to the public. There is no more dividing line between politics and journalism which is why the public has lost trust in mainstream media.
As for the issue of respect, while I agree that it is earned, one also has to learn how to distinguish what the difference is between experience and wisdom. The National Artist for Literature is a nonagenarian who is a walking oral history book. He has lived through all of the Presidents since Quezon. You can’t be a know-it-all which is the problem with journalists today. There is no genuine love of country but only the love of self. There is no principled stand except for how to get ahead to earn a comfortable living by their standards and hobnob with the personalities who matter. It is the fake-it-until-you-make-it mantra which pervades and governs their ethics and morality. There is no more focus on the honing of the craft or the trade and taking pride in the how one conducts himself in the practice of what once was a noble profession.",Others
Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview a reminder that the Yellowtards have become IRRELEVANT,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/toni-gonzagas-bongbong-marcos-interview-a-reminder-that-the-yellowtards-have-become-irrelevant/,"How many times do you need to hit these “journalists” for them to realize that Toni Gonzaga is not a “journalist” who is supposed to ask Bongbong Marcos (BBM) the tough questions? In his PhilSTAR piece “Walking on landmines: Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview”, Joel Pablo Salud admits that Gonzaga, while not a journalist, but more of an entertainer is still remiss because it is on her to let the “truth” come out.
“To treat controversial personalities with kid gloves is to be totally ignorant of the responsibility an interviewer carries on his or her shoulders, and the interviewee’s capacity to answer tough questions,” writes Salud. Then again, given the attention to detail that mainstream media has devoted to the Marcos family, is there anything else that the public isn’t aware of with the exception of those who haven’t learned how to read yet or are devoid of hearing and cognitive skills given the medium is video?
About the only reason why the likes of Salud and his ilk are pissed is because Gonzaga’a vlog has a huge following and they are afraid this will make BBM more popular than he already is, to the detriment of whoever the Opposition standard-bearer will be. I had a short discussion with a colleague/friend earlier in the evening and we touched on this subject. We shared the same opinion about how stupid it is that the Opposition is now picking on Gonzaga but they had no complaints when Vice President Leni Robredo was interviewed. It is also ironic that despite their admission that Gonzaga is not a journalist, they still want to hold her accountable for her sin of omission by not asking Marcos Jr, tough questions.
Basically, what they wanted Gonzaga to do was squeeze blood from stone as what they have been doing with the Marcoses since 1986. They have contended with their ignominious departure from Malacañan, exile in the US and other countries for the Imee, having to return to their own country to be treated like pariahs and ostracized no end by former friends and allies and live ordinary lives compared to what they were used to in the past. I have seen the former First Lady leave her house in San Juan in a BMW 5 series sedan with only a driver and one bodyguard in tow. She even stopped by the stall of a vendor along F. Blumentritt in San Juan to buy fruits but she didn’t step out of her car. She did it through the window of the vehicle. This is a far cry from her heyday when her long motorcade would pass by J.P. Laurel St. going to Malacañan where we could catch a glimpse of her from the window of the vehicle she was on, waving to us on the street while we stood watching the procession of vehicles laden with her entourage and security detail.
The Marcoses have contended with ignominity with grace and dignity. There are, in fact, more politicians of lesser stature who are more haughty now than they were before even at their peak. What the likes of Salud which the rest of his cohorts don’t acknowledge is the Marcoses could have opted to live in exile abroad in peace and enjoy their wealth. For this matter, every Marcos crony could have done the same but they, nay all of them, chose to return and face the cases filed against them. Some like Lucio Tan, didn’t even leave, at the height of the “Edsa Revolution.”
Why then does the Ateneo Martial Law Museum have the temerity to invite Gonzaga to an “education” initiative about the horrors of martial law in the Philippines without even taking into account the involvement of Ninoy Aquino in the organization of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which led Marcos to declare martial law is beyond belief. The Opposition accuses the Marcoses of “historical revisionism” when they are equally guilty of the same.
This invitation is no different from what Mao made the Chinese go through as “reeducation” during his infamous Cultural Revolution. Who’s being tbe dictator now? Stifling free speech? Who? Is it the Marcoses or the Opposition who claim to be the “good” battling the “evil”?
It has often been said that the sins of the father are not the sins of the son. The Opposition insists that each and every Marcos was complicit in the “crimes” of their parents. But which is the bigger crime against the Filipino people? Is it what the Marcos’ did in twenty years in power? Or is it what the Opposition failed to do in their thirty years in power?",Others
"Yellowtards oppose freedom of speech, continue to vilify Toni Gonzaga over her Bongbong Marcos interview",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/yellowtards-oppose-freedom-of-speech-continue-to-vilify-toni-gonzaga-over-her-bongbong-marcos-interview/,"Now the wokes are complaining about social media personalities like Toni Gonzaga who interviewed former Senator Bongbong Marcos (BBM) in her YouTube show last week. Initially, they wanted to hold Gonzaga accountable as a “journalist.” Traditional media is biased in their favor which is why they don’t call them out. But if the interview is not to their liking, then the journalist is held accountable.
During the Marcos years, pro-Marcos Pinoys would tune in to the government-owned Channel 4. You had Ronnie Nathanielsz and Rita Gaddi Baltazar as the main anchors. It was GMA-7 which began the trend of independent public affairs programs. Viewpoint and later on Straight from the Shoulder. The discussions were lively but there was no hostility on the part of the anchor, unlike now when they can be condescending. Karen Davila, Christian Esguerra and Mike Navallo are guilty of this. It’s not surprising because they’re with ABS-CBN. The basic tenet of objectivity is no longer observed. The bias is meant to be shown. The goal is to influence public opinion. The only loser is the public because those who have adopted the role of a mercenary will not exercise his profession in a manner which puts public interest as the priority.
The late Louie Beltran had the knack of asking the most difficult questions of his guests without them taking offense because there was no malice on his part. For example, if Beltran was interviewing BBM, I’m sure he would bring up the issue of martial law in the proper context. Marcos Jr., wasn’t an elected or appointed official at that time so it would be in the context of a son whose father was the President. It would be different if Beltran was interviewing Marcos Sr. because he was the President and the public would want to know what is his opinion of the decision he made at that crucial juncture in the country’s history.
But most important is to allow the public to make their own judgment and for the media personality to not be the judge. This is what journalism, in its purest form, is all about. There is no excuse for the criticism of Gonzaga because she is not a journalist. Her vlog is not a public affairs program nor does it follow that format. Like all Filipinos, she has a right to freedom of speech. Technology has made it possible for every individual to air their opinions publicly. There is no harm in that. There is also no “good” versus “evil”. There are only opinions.
Maturity and civility dictates that we should be respectful of each and everyone’s points of view but it is the Opposition that have been guilty of lowering the level of discourse by not sticking to the issues and making unfounded accusations. This is why we leave ourselves at the mercy of propagandists because we afford them the opportunity by being uncivil and immature.",Others
"According to @ANCALERTS anchor Ian Esguerra, Karen Davila did a BAD job when she interviewed Leni Robredo",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/according-to-ancalerts-anchor-ian-esguerra-karen-davila-did-a-bad-job-when-she-interviewed-leni-robredo/,"So butthurt are the Yellowtards over Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview that they’d come up with the dumbest logic in their lame attempts to cancel her. Most recent is this ululation coming from ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) anchor Christian Esguerra. According to Esguerra a “bad” journalist is one who makes her interview subject “happy”.
It seems that, rather than direct that assertion to Ms Gonzaga (who does not even presume to be a “journalist”), Esguerra should, instead, call out his colleague Karen Davila. Davila recently featured Vice President Leni Robredo in a fluff piece in which a tour of her little condo was spun as proof of Robredo’s “simple” living.
Clearly, Robredo came out of that “interview” all happy chappy. What does that make Davila? Well, one would then assume that Mr. Esguerra wouldn’t be too impressed, right? Maybe somebody should take a statement from the esteemed anchor as we are all genuinely curious as to what his opinion might be on that matter.
If the Yellowtards are hopping mad over Gonzaga’s treatment of Marcos on her show, and insist on being so prescriptive of what she ought to have asked him, then why not up the ante and sick Davila on Marcos? Davila, after all, is widely perceived to be a Yellowtard “journalist” and will likely do their bidding.
Oh but that would give a platform to the “dictator’s son”.
Whatever.
Goes to show that when you lie to people, mislead them, and keep them hooked to an imaginary demon, you would latch on to any moronism to stick to your dishonest narrative. Thanks to “journalists” like Esguerra and Davila, Big Corporate Media are now paying for those sins.",Others
Mainstream “journalists” like Joel Pablo Salud fear “trolls” because they fear the growing IRRELEVANCE of their profession,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/mainstream-journalists-like-joel-pablo-salud-fear-trolls-because-they-fear-the-growing-irrelevance-of-their-profession/,"Spied this puff piece by Joel Pablo Salud published on a certain LiCAS News Philippines. In this article pompously-titled “My State of the Nation Address”, Salud shrieks about how “the bloodstained curtains slowly begin to close on the current regime” and, as such, that he be “allowed” the words he would go on to write. Not surprisingly, the eminent “editor, journalist and the author of several books of fiction and political nonfiction” turns his sympathetic eye to, where else, the “plight” of his “journalist” comrades…
Since that fateful day in July 2016 where Duterte sparked an ongoing inquisition against Filipino journalists, when he said, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch,” the battle since then has gone from shadow boxing to full contact.
Faced with the daily risk of intimidation, illegal arrests and detention, the possibility of infection due to the pandemic, retrenchment and poverty, charges of libel or terrorism, and the looming threat of being the target of assassinations, our journalists couldn’t care less about all these things for as long as the job requires them to be where they ought to be: right in the middle of where it is happening.
Thus began the systematic persecution which left a little over 20 journalists dead in just five years, while hundreds of others suffered harassment, intimidation, threats, and illegal arrests, including journalists on campus.
Brings tears to your eyes, doesn’t it?
When journalists who are also “activists” cry that the sky is falling, how many times will the public believe them given the state of journalism in the country today? The basic tenets of journalism are simple enough. News should be based on facts. Objectivity is required here. The gist of the story should be contained in the first three paragraphs. Opinions are expressed in the op-ed page. News anchors should “read” the news. Interviews should be conducted in a manner which brings out facts not conjecture or speculation. Columnists should base exposés on facts not rumors and innuendos. What’s been happening since 1986 is simply what journalists working under the regime of former President Ferdinand Marcos fought to have but now practice with impunity; “press freedom”.
Like it or not, the Philippine media actually enjoys the most freedom in the region. Where else can you see journalists successfully being elected into public office? Philippine journalists claim that the cases of ABS-CBN and Rappler are the best examples of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte clamping down on “press freedom”. The fact is, they choose to give the public only one side of the story. Not much mention is made of the fact that an incumbent President called out two anchors of the broadcast giant when he was the guest of honor at its anniversary celebration. The reality is the franchise of the network giant could have been renewed. But that renewal was shot down by the same Congress that impeached an incumbent Chief Justice without the benefit of due process back in 2012. Indeed, this impeachment was backed by the very same media groups that now cry bloody murder over that non-renewal.
When journalists call for the closure of the network due to its franchise expiring to be an election issue, you realize that something is not right. In the case of Rappler, there are two companies registered by the stockholders. The first is the holding company. The second is the actual corporate entity operating as the media outfit. The structure is such that the holding company can receive funds which can be funnelled into the operating company. These funds can be classified as advances from stockholders in order to maintain the operating company as a going concern. Why is it then that journalists have not written about this story and presented these important facts to the public? Rappler has received foreign funding by way of grants. It is not a university nor is it a non-governmental organization that is entitled to such funds.
The organization for which Salud writes his puff piece has the accompanying graphic stating its vision and mission. “Light of Catholics in Asia” is what LiCAS apparently stands for. “Our coverage from Asia brings to the world stories of human rights violations, denial of justice and religious persecution in some of the world’s fastest growing economies, all within the political backdrop of eroding religious and press freedom.” This elaboration is proof that LiCAS News only shines the “light” on one side of the stories it publishes.
Philippine media was already a force to be reckoned with before martial law. Marcos shutdown media outlets and only allowed a few to reopen after he put down the threat to his government. The evolution of media post-Marcos is also tied to politics and business because of the relationship between the two. The truth is money and power are also the primary considerations of those who are in the industry. The facade was maintained in the past because of the realpolitik. Not anymore. The line has been crossed. Perhaps it is because the unwritten rules have all been thrown out the window. In the same manner the quality of journalists and journalism deteriorated with the quality of the characters of those being covered. Social media has taken up the slack. Citizens have used the platform to make their opinions known. It is ironic that the very people whom journalists were supposed to serve have taken it upon themselves, to do the task of holding the politicians and the journalists themselves accountable for the consequences of their actions. But make no mistake. The “journalist-activists” have gone down to the level of gaslighting in their bid to change the public sentiment.
Democracy’s reality is such that it is only a modified version of fiefdoms. We have seen the unravelling of America which was its showcase for the longest time. Europe was the center of global civilization where empires were made until the massive unrest of the masses breaking away from the chains of poverty led them to the land of the free. We are the only Asian country that mimics the American Identity because of our colonial past. In essence, the state of journalism is a field in which one battle is being fought. What is significant is the people are beginning to take the power back in their hands to do so. This is why some them are being conveniently labeled as “trolls” because they pose the biggest threat to the power structure and dynamic of the media industry that employs these “journalists”. Indeed, you can smell the fear in Salud’s shrill writing as he, yet again as his comrades keep assert, goes all crybaby about this “troll” invasion supposedly led by Duterte…
His army of paid trolls would be unleashed on a populace who had had enough of his lies. Social media would again be the site of a fierce battle for hearts and minds. It’s a campaign whose aftermath may dictate the outcome of the 2022 elections, if an election would take place.
All this fielding of candidates, this fracas with supposed “political allies-turned-rivals,” may just be another ruse to keep us off guard, to miss the last strategy in the Marcosian playbook: the declaration of martial law.
For your information, Chicken Little and your Henny Penny pals in Manila’s tita set, that movement you people allude to was labelled the “mosquito press” during the time of Marcos. Now, it is simply “citizen journalism”. The people have taken it upon themselves to take care of their own because “journalists” no longer fulfils that role — neither competently nor ethically.",Others
Prime Media Holdings Inc sets Romualdez clan up for a big piece of the broadcast media pie,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/prime-media-holdings-inc-sets-romualdez-clan-up-for-a-big-piece-of-the-broadcast-media-pie/,"It appears that Leyte representative and House Majority Leader Ferdinand Martin Romualdez is now ready to expand his media empire from print to broadcast. The Philippine Stock Exchange had today reportedly “lifted the trading suspension of Prime Media Holdings Inc. (PRIM) after the company submitted the required comprehensive disclosure on backdoor listing.”
Prime Media Holdings is a listed but dormant company on the Philippine Stock Exchange which was acquired by Romualdez from Metro Pacific after a bankruptcy claim for a majority of 77% of its outstanding shares. These are owned by another Romualdez holding company, RYM Business Management Corporation, RYM being the initials of Romualdez’s wife, Yedda Marie. Another Romualdez company, Philippine Collective Media Corporation, which operates FM and AM radio stations in Tacloban, would then buy into Prime Media through a share swap, giving Prime Media control of PCMC and its radio network.
“With the national franchise of PCMC, PRIM can engage in an active business of mass media and further leverage its franchise and network for use by existing content providers in need of broadcasting rights,” PRIM said in a disclosure yesterday.
PCMC was given a national broadcast franchise to operate television and radio stations in the country. Romualdez is heir to the business empire built by his father, former Ambassador Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez. Kokoy was often called the “dumb” brother of First Lady Imelda Marcos but he was far from living up to the pejorative description of him. In fact, he was responsible for the windfall the Lopez family enjoyed after Cory Aquino gave back control of Meralco with very little compensation accruing to the government. Kokoy had a competent executive in Mario Camacho running Meralco and First Philippine Holdings for him. PCI Bank was being handled by Paeng Buenaventura while the Journal Group of publications was in the capable hands of several veteran journalists.
Former Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin, was at the helm of Benguet Consolidated, one of the oldest mining companies during the Marcos regime. Interestingly, brother Philip is married to Sandy Prieto of the family which control the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Eldest brother Daniel is based in New York and has made a name for himself as an architect to the rich and famous of New York society. Daniel took up Political Science and Economics at Yale only to enroll again in Architecture after graduation. He has been featured in Architectural Digest as one of the top ten architects in the US.
Business and politics go hand-in-hand in the Philippines. Romualdez voted against the grant of a new franchise to ABS-CBN but has been actively pursuing a blocktime deal for some of ABS-CBN’s shows to air on his network. The provincial radio stations will come in handy for the 2022 election given the pandemic environment. Romualdez is one of those rumored to be a potential Vice-Presidential running mate of Presidential daughter Sara Duterte if she decides to make a bid for the Presidency.",Others
President Duterte’s 2021 SONA: not a “long goodbye” but more of a “to be continued”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/president-dutertes-2021-sona-not-a-long-goodbye-but-more-of-a-to-be-continued/,"Substance abuse. A columnist whose piece doesn’t have any, is guilty of abusing the reading public. Isn’t it naiveté to use Rappler‘s viewers as bases for assertions about the “declining” popularity of the President. Most pundits have come out with their post-SONA review. Opinions are divided along partisan lines of course. Inevitably the Opposition, like Inquirer columnist Manuel L. Quezon III (MLQ3) fall into the trap of trivializing the outsider President. Following his predictably less-than-glowing “commentary” on this year’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) delivered by President Rordrigo Duterte to Congress Monday which he described as “The long goodbye”, MLQ3 writes in conclusion…
Luckily for the President, plunging attention (2016 views on Rappler: 2.4 million; in 2021: 484, 426 as of Tuesday afternoon) and the historic win of Hidilyn Diaz overshadowed the President’s final report. In politics, luck is as important as any act of commission or omission. Mr. Duterte got a free pass from an athlete whose reward for expressing joy over meeting the President was to be included in an anti-administration matrix by his chief presidential legal counsel.
Since the death of former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino III, the arguments have been childish. It’s about who initiated what project. If you think about it, Duterte made no accusations against the previous administration about corruption. All the awarded projects were continued. For Duterte, there was no looking back at the past. He was looking only at the present. If I were in MLQ3’s shoes, my time would be better spent analyzing the inanities of opposition leaders. Why does Vice President Leni Robredo have to come up with her counter-SONA when it isn’t traditional to begin with? Politicizing the first Olympic gold medal also doesn’t do much for their cause. If Sartorial Sal was stupid to include Gretchen Fullido Ho and Hidilyn Diaz in a destabilization matrix at that time, he’s no different from the sycophantic blunders of close aides of past administrations.
The basic difference between the Yellows and Duterte is that the latter does not claim the projects as his because he knows well these are financed by public funds. It’s the people’s monies. The administration claims it as a whole in terms of performance achievements but it’s so unlike before when you had Daang Matuwid plastered on every Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) billboard describing a particular project. For all the flood control projects then Secretary Rogelio “Babes” Singson undertook as DPWH Secretary, it surely failed again last Friday when most of the Metro was flooded due to the southwest monsoon.
Reading the biased news of today makes you wonder if you are in the same country as the Opposition. If you tuned in to Rappler‘s SONA coverage, there was no attempt at objectivity. It was more biased than any Ronnie Nathanielsz/Rita Gaddi Baltazar coverage on the state-owned network during the National Media Production Center (NMPC) days of Greg Cendaña and Ed Finlan. The Yellowidiots fail to realize that they are becoming more Marcosian as they sink into the abyss they have made for themselves. It only serves to dampen their credibility and puts to shame the Marcos Loyalists of past years at their peak.
The last SONA of Duterte should’ve been indicative of his mindset as his term ends. Normally, a President waxes emotional about his achievements. It’s his political swansong after all. The Opposition must’ve been perturbed over the fact that this wasn’t the tone of the Presidential address. In effect, Duterte didn’t put a period at the end of his speech. It was more like “to be continued.” There was a man I knew before who wasn’t well-educated formally but loved to read. He kept on repeating the adage “treat your enemies well and send them home defeated.” In hindsight, Duterte has done exactly this. His exercise of Presidential power was carefully measured. He constantly plays the long game which is why the Opposition has been in a state of befuddlement. What is noticeable is the fact that the opposition is shifting blame to Duterte for acts they are guilty of. Gaslighting is at the top of that list. Refusal to accept the consequences of actions is another. Duterte is allegedly narcissistic. I tend to think it’s actually the opposition who are. They continue to exist in their own ecosystem where they are insulated from the realities of the outside world. The real world.",Others
"Yellowtard economic “experts” @JCPunongbayan, Ateneo alumna @znsuzara, and SHARON CUNETA comment on recent Ph economy data!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/yellowtard-economic-experts-jcpunongbayan-ateneo-alumna-znsuzara-and-sharon-cuneta-comment-on-recent-philippine-economy-data/,"“Economic experts” sprouted overnight after the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) released its economic data the other day. The PSA numbers showed that the Philippines moved out of recession territory with GDP growth turning positive for the first time since its tumultuous plunge last year on the back of the first lockdown which effectively shutdown the economy. The naysayers had a field day saying it was the result of the base effect; -18% growth had the number going nowhere but up. Mathematics is based on logic so nothing wrong with that.
I found it rich that even Sharon Cuneta weighed in on the matter. Yes. The Megastar. Wife of Sen. Kiko Pangilinan. Recently returned from the US. Underwent breast reduction surgery. That was the news about her prior to her making the economic statement. Of course, her breast reduction procedure had no economic effect. But it is really the bottom of desperation when the Opposition resorts to such a move. The truth is the only time the opposition will be content is when they are back in power. And when that happens, it will be their turn to make the most out what is a nominal achievement at best. But it’s still positive news.
What is really offensive is how the millennial “economic experts” of the Opposition continue to criticize the economic managers without offering any solution to their identified problems. I’m referring to the group of JC Punongbayan and “Budget Babe” Zy-za Nadine Suzara, who is the Executive Director for iLead, the Institute for Leadership, Empowerment and Democracy sponsored by the Ateneo de Manila. These two carp endlessly about how the economic managers are doing everything wrong but don’t offer alternative solutions to what they deem to be wrong to begin with. Last June, a piece Suzara jointly wrote with several iLead honchos (it takes several of them to screw a lightbulb on) published on, get this, the one and only Al Jazeera (where fellow Yellow “journalist” Barnaby “I was just reporting” Lo also works as its Philippine “correspondent”), was given the predictable title “In this pandemic, Duterte has his priorities all wrong”. But of course, right? That time, she — or rather they — try to spin some kind of dishonest cause-and-effect link between that thesis and the proliferation of “community pantries”…
In the past couple of weeks, community pantries have mushroomed all over the Philippines. The poor, left with no other options, formed long lines in the summer heat, under threat of COVID-19, just to get what the government of President Rodrigo Duterte has so far failed to give: economic aid.
The sudden growth of community pantries mirrors not just the extent of the Philippines’ economic crisis but also the extent of the government’s neglect. Total output, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), plunged by 9.5 percent in 2020, the Philippines’ worst economic slump since World War II. Gross per capita income plummeted to 2015 levels. Countless businesses, especially small ones, were forced to shut down and cut their workers’ wages. Joblessness skyrocketed, and more than three million Filipinos remained unemployed by March this year.
Judging by the shrill manner with which she tweets it is clear that Suzara harbors quite the chip on her shoulder that colours her “economic analysis”…
To be fair, even with the sketchy enthusiasm Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua waxed over the recent PSA data, the Manila Times editor in today’s piece “Not much good news in GDP ‘growth’ result” highlighted the need for circumspection considering the “uninspired reception” accorded it by more credible economic analysts. However, he also cautions the hoi polloi of “economic analysis”…
We might criticize administration officials for discussing the Q2 GDP data in terms that are obviously not congruent with reality, but we would stop short of blaming them for the less than adequate results. Throughout the 20 months – and counting – of the coronavirus pandemic, it has posed unimaginable challenges to the entire world. The current surge is a glaring example; many countries, even those more advanced in rolling out vaccines and reducing case numbers, have suffered significant setbacks. There are no models or precedents for managing an economy under these volatile circumstances, and thus, no certainty that alternatives to what might be perceived as government missteps would actually have better results.
There is not a single country in the world today that’s not grappling with the Delta-induced surge. Rich countries thought they were free and clear of the virus until Delta variant came along. The concept of herd immunity is no more because Delta infects the fully-vaccinated as well. The vaccines only provide a measure of protection against developing a severe case of Covid leading to death. This is precisely why the latest lockdown was declared.
Scientists are at a loss because they are also amazed at how Covid mutates. The Delta variant exhibited a change in amino acid component of the spike protein which the virus uses to latch on to healthy cells and spread throughout the host. It is 65% more contagious and has 1,200 times more the viral load of the original virus. It also has a shorter incubation period of six days. Health officials are now looking at booster shots. This means vaccine procurement will have to be multiplied times three. The economic managers aren’t sleeping on the job.
A slew of economic measures have been passed by Congress. There is a cocktail of acronyms to this effect; CREATE, FIST, and GUIDE. There are also pending amendments to existing laws which will facilitate the entry of foreign direct investments. These laws are the Public Service Act, Retail Trade Liberalization Act and the Foreign Investment Act. The government and the private sector must speed up digitization if the economy is to adapt to the new normal. This should presuppose a “pandemic-is-endemic” outlook.
Covid is not going to go way anytime soon. We have to learn to live with it. Actually, we should have learned to live with it by now. For the so-called “economic experts,” including The Megastar, it would be best if you can criticize and provide solutions at the same time. It’s easy to do Monday morning quarterbacking but when you’re in the  hot seat, I doubt very much if any one of them would know where to begin.",Others
“I was just reporting. That’s my job”: @AlJazeera hack Barnaby Lo defends sloppy report on Ph gov’t COVID-19 response,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/i-was-just-reporting-thats-my-job-aljazeera-hack-barnaby-lo-defends-sloppy-report-on-ph-govt-covid-19-response/,"The dismal state of “journalism” in the Philippines is once again in the spotlight. On exhibit is a case of dishonest “reporting” delivered by Al Jazeera‘s Philippine correspondent Barnaby Lo.
Lo, evidently unprepared for a live patch to an Al Jazeera anchor yesterday, stammered through his on-the-ground “report” from Manila and claimed that there was a “mad scramble of people” for COVID-19 vaccines there supposedly caused, as Lo seemingly wanted his audience to believe, by a statement he “reports” was made by President Rodrigo Duterte that unvaccinated people will be arrested if they stepped out of their homes.
Ahead of a stringent 2-week lockdown, thousands of Filipinos crowded vaccination sites after President Rodrigo Duterte warned the unvaccinated may not be able to go out and may even face arrest. Live report on @AJEnglish yesterday. pic.twitter.com/DxRrWmRslX
— Barnaby Lo 吳宗鴻 (@barnabychuck) August 6, 2021
Not amused by this insinuation, Philippine Foreign Secretary Teddy Locsin, in a tweet Saturday, challenged Lo’s “report” citing that people visiting vaccination centres observed sensible queues and jabs were being administered there in an orderly manner.
The trouble with Lo is how he selectively singled out Manila as a sample upon which he issues sweeping statements about how the Philippine government is handling the pandemic. Interestingly, this closely follows a similar “report” filed by Dwight de Leon on “social news network” Rappler on the 5th August that screamed “Chaos erupts at COVID-19 vaccination sites a day before Metro Manila ECQ”.
In Manila, police estimated that the turnout on early Thursday morning, August 5, could go as high as 22,000 across four malls operating as vaccination hubs.
De Leon noted that, on record, “President Rodrigo Duterte had said he wanted police and barangay captains to restrict the movement of people unwilling to get a COVID-19 jab.”
In an earlier “report” aired on Al Jazeera, Lo cherry-picked statements taken from people interviewed at the scene of the so-called “mad scramble” that are clear misinterpretations of this statement.
Lo used these as evidence to defend himself. He responded to Locsin in a tweet, “I was just reporting. That’s my job.” He later posted a screenshot of a log of these interviews. “Interviewees were the ones who said they scrambled to vaccination sites because of what President Duterte said. Okay?”, Lo tweeted.
Lo could have balanced his ,”reporting” and prevented roping in Al Jazeera into becoming an accessory to the propagation of false perceptions by applying a handful of simple measures including (1) making reference to the original statement Duterte issued (as Rappler “reporter” Dwight de Leon had done), (2) putting the “mad scramble” in proper perspective by taking stock of the situations in other Metro Manila municipalities, and (3) being a bit more prepared for his live patch to the Al Jazeera mothership. Clearly all that basic due diligence was asking a bit too much of this kiddie “reporter”.",Others
"Platforms and action plans, NOT mere motherhood statements: Filipinos should expect MORE from their candidates",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/platforms-and-action-plans-not-mere-motherhood-statements-filipinos-should-expect-more-from-their-candidates/,"Mass media was existent even before the rise of President Rodrigo Duterte. But the clowns in public office were the offshoots of the dumbing down of the Filipino by ABS-CBN and the change in demographics brought about by uncontrolled population growth. Professor Randy David in his Inquirer piece “Politics in the age of mass media” rightly observed how politicians nowadays “spend a lot of time and resources creating personal ‘narratives’ that might appeal to a fickle voting public.” David points his finger at today’s “era of the mass media” where…
The old values of statesmanship have been replaced by the ever-shifting topics of public opinion. Today, what animates public opinion has become more difficult to pin down. We see only whom it favors, but we are left guessing what moves it at any given time.
David doesn’t name names because the Opposition would be front and center in the creation of narratives which all began with Cory Aquino, the “simple housewife who toppled Marcos”. The image of her husband Ninoy Aquino was rehabilitated from typical regional warlord to one of a Christian social democrat.
Politics in the Philippines has never been based on ideology. The Nacionalistas rose to power as advocates of self-rule during the American period. Right after the war, the priorities of America in the region changed with the geopolitical landscape. Its focus was on Japan and preventing the spread of communism. The Philippines was granted independence and Manuel Roxas became General Douglas MacArthur’s fair-haired boy. Thus was born the Liberal Party.
From 1946 to 1969, politicians went from one to another in what could be best described as revolving door politics. It became the tradition with every election cycle similar to what migratory birds do with the changing of the season. Ferdinand Marcos’s cure for this was the parliamentary form of government. The result was the monolith that was the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party. There were few opposition parties in the Batasang Pambansa (national legislature) then but you could see the system working because of the emergence of the Pusyon Bisaya and the Mindanao Alliance. Without this system, we wouldn’t have seen the likes of Hilario Davide, Nene Pimentel, Bono Adaza and Reuben Canoy rise to national prominence.
If Cory hadn’t done away with the entire 1973 Constitution then we probably wouldn’t find ourselves in this quagmire of mediocrity now. But the system’s rot is beginning to show. We have recycled Senators and newbies who aren’t exactly qualified at the bare minimum. Willie Revillame at least used his head and decided not to run. But topping the surveys for this election cycle is Raffy Tulfo whose platform is to give justice to the oppressed. That’s not what we need from legislators in the time of the pandemic. This is not much different from what the Opposition’s platform is.
I don’t think they even bother to read about what has taken place in the short span of time the pandemic has caused global disruption. I glanced at an interview of Gibo Teodoro by that Pinoy expat in the Netherlands, Sass Rogando Sasot, who may be credentialed but by no means nuanced in statecraft. At least Gibo has something to offer by way of what he’s seen in the private sector with respect to digitization. However, we need more than this to cope with the pandemic-is-endemic approach which needs the whole-of-government to get behind it in conjunction with the private sector.
The present situation requires prioritisation of initiatives and programs focused on food and energy security as well as public health. We need foreign direct investments to set the economy on the path to recovery because we can’t borrow our way to it. Governments are sitting on a massive pile of debt and it will continue to grow as other countries are also spending their way out of the pandemic-induced recession. The positive sign is the public going out of their way to participate in the 2022 polls. Not even the pandemic can prevent people from registering as voters. This is why it is imperative that this election be issues-based and not the usual personality-based politics we have come to expect from candidates. From the national down to the local level, it should be about platforms of governance. An action plan not motherhood statements.
The Opposition would rather make the election about personalities; Marcos, Duterte and the usual narrative of authoritarianism, populism and damaged institutions. This is the liberals and the leftists making a mountain out of a molehill of irrelevant issues. We should hold the Opposition to a higher standard because their track record from 1986-2016 leaves much to be desired. There are still a lot of reforms needed to make government more responsive and minimize what is lost to corruption. It is not only about political personalities but government as well.
Hopefully the greater majority of Filipinos realize this. Maybe they already have if we go by their efforts to make their voice heard through the ballot come May 2022. The onus is really on the Filipino to make the decision.",Others
Congresswoman Claudine Bautista should SUE Enchong Dee and Inquirer “reporter” Dana Cruz for LIBEL,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/congresswoman-claudine-bautista-should-sue-enchong-dee-and-inquirer-reporter-dana-cruz-for-libel/,"Showbiz personality Enchong Dee issued an “apology” to Congresswoman Claudine Bautista on Twitter today for suggesting last weekend that a Michael Cinco gown she wore in her recent wedding was funded by money stolen from the organisation Drivers United for Mass Progress and Equal Rights party list (DUMPER) which she represents in the Philippines’ House of Representatives.
I have been reckless in the tweet I posted and I take full responsibility for my lapse in judgment.
With deep regret, I would like to apologize to Congresswoman Claudine Bautista, her husband, their families, and the Dumper Partylist. I reacted based on impulse without thinking of the consequences nor the harm it may cause. I learned that as dutiful citizens, we must always fact-check our statements to avoid sensationalism and the spread of false news.
I will take this opportunity to reflect on the wrong I have done and use this opportunity to better myself in being more discerning of my actions.
Perhaps the Philippines’ mob of Big Corporate Media “journalists” should do the right thing and follow suit considering that they’ve been complicit in this latest bout of lynching. “Journalist” Dana Cruz, for example, filed an evidently-slanted sensationalist report Sunday on the “Entertainment” section of the Inquirer headlining that “Agot Isidro, Enchong Dee call out drivers rep Claudine Bautista for ‘lavish’ wedding”. Cruz “reported” that “Dee believes that money meant to help drivers and commuters went to [Bautista’s] wedding”. Cruz went on to quote a tweet fielded by Dee on the 14th August that has since been deleted.
The money for commuters and drivers went to her wedding. Let’s not prolong this conversation and don’t say otherwise.
— Enchong Dee (@enchongdee777) August 14, 2021
On the part of Isidro and Dee, well, they were just being the stupid showbiz personalities that they are. On the other hand, one would expect a bit more class from a so-called “journalist”. Cruz’s sin as a “journalist” stems from her complete lack of balance in her “reporting”, not bothering to take a statement from Rep. Bautista, DUMPER, nor, at the very least, doing a bit of research on the circumstances surrounding the wedding itself. It is interesting to note too that Cruz conspicuously names the designer of the allegedly offensive wedding gown in her “report” but fails to tell her readers who it is exactly Rep. Bautista was marrying — an important detail in any “report” on a wedding, one would think. Clearly a whole pile of malice was part of the intent in her Inquirer “report”.
It is also worth noting that Bautista is one of the 70 members of Congress who voted against the extension of the franchise to broadcast of top media conglomerate ABS-CBN. When one connects the dots, it becomes easier to see why the usual suspects in the Philippines’ showbiz industry were quick to pounce on this latest outrage fad. But it was Enchong Dee’s statement that stood out because he directly accused Rep. Bautista of criminal activity. That statement was clearly done with malice intended and was aimed to smear the reputation of a member of Philippine Congress. If Dee was really sincere about his “apology” he should also be willing to face the consequences of his actions. That also goes for the “reporters” who conspired with these celebrities to make a mountain of what should have been nothing more than a molehill.",Others

So people like Cabato think government doesn’t have the right to protect itself against its enemies or those who undermine it? We have a new generation of woke “journalist-activists” who wear their ideology on their arms. To begin with, they should be objective in the practice of their profession and just report the facts. It is the public which makes the judgment. But in the new order of things as espoused by Rappler and its CEO Maria Ressa, journalists practice “truth to power” to fight for liberalism against illiberalism.
The country that sticks out like a sore finger at this practice is Singapore where media is state-controlled and protests against the government are not tolerated. What basis did the Nobel Committee have in awarding the prize to Ressa given Rappler is still operating and its reportage not being curtailed? Why was there no similar outcry against former President Noynoy Aquino when he demanded the heads of Noli De Castro and Ted Failon from Gabby Lopez for being critical of him and his administration? Recall that Aquino publicly rebuked the two during ABS-CBN’s anniversary celebration.
The leftist-militant-liberal wokes are hypocrites and traitors because they sell out their country and countrymen for the sake of their social status and compensation they receive from media organizations controlled by oligarchs and foreign news companies which maintain news bureaus in the country. Leftist-militants are supposedly patriotic but look at how they cancel the national artist for literature because he has a contrary opinion about Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize (excerpt follows).
The real test for journalists was made during the Marcos dictatorship when he imposed censorship, closed all media and jailed journalists. Now, let us look at Maria Ressa’s credentials. The most important is she worked with CNN. I haven’t read anything memorable by her. She had developed important connections as this award has shown and was able to get foreign support for Rappler. Duterte was not serious with Maria Ressa, else he could have nailed her like he did with Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and Senator Leila de Lima.
F. Sionil Jose has never sold out his country to foreigners. He makes his living off his books and his bookshop. The continuing existence of these social elitists is what fuels the rise of populists because it’s only through the likes of Duterte that the masa has found their voice and their champion. When elitists lose elections they describe the masa by the pejorative “bobotante”. And then they bitch and whine to no end. This is typical narcissistic behavior.
This is why I don’t see much of a future with the millennials and the youth who are constantly having one form or another, of existential crises. They are weak-willed weak-minded and are dispossessed of leadership qualities. It is easier for them to sellout than take a stand for their principles, if they had any, to begin with.",Others
Maria Ressa apologists dismiss online “trolling” of her Nobel “Peace Prize” acceptance speech as “fake”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/maria-ressa-apologists-dismiss-online-trolling-of-her-nobel-peace-prize-acceptance-speech-as-fake/,"Opposition “thought leaders” like communist “journalist” Inday Espina Varona take a typical position on the Filipino public’s response to Rappler CEO Maria Ressa’s junket to Oslo, Norway to receive her Nobel “Peace Prize”. It seems that comments flooding social media accounts and posts associated with Ressa’s award expressing disagreement with the occasion had been significant enough to prompt Varona to react. However, rather than accord some benefit of the doubt that a good proportion of these online reactions reflect a big enough subset of Filipino public sentiment, Varona was outright dismissive.
Those trolling the Nobel page & accounts featuring Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize aren’t causing her embarrassment. They’re graphic evidence of the toxic sludge linked to disinformation campaigns by abusive states and enablers among rapacious tech firms#HoldTheLine #CourageOn

How does Varona simply conclude that all this online commentary that does not fit her preferred narrative of Ressa being God’s Gift to Philippine Journalism are all the work of “trolls” who form the “toxic sludge linked to disinformation campaigns by abusive states and enablers”? It seems Varona is guilty of the very behaviours of the average “consumer of mass disinformation” her kind disdain as she herself uncritically regurgitates sound bytes from Ressa’s acceptance speech (full text here) to adorn the above tweet.
Varona conveniently omits important context when she summarily jumps into conclusions like these — that an overwhelming majority of eligible Filipino voters do not subscribe to the view she and her cadre of Maria Ressa cheerleaders are propagating. This is evident in survey after survey over the last couple of years showing that Filipinos remain supportive of Duterte’s government. In recent months, these same reputable survey firms have issued reports clearly showing that Filipino voters are set to elect “the dictator’s son” Bongbong Marcos and The Enabled’s daughter Sara Duterte to the presidency and vice presidency come May 2022.
Given these facts, Varona should apply a bit more circumspection the next time she parrots Ressa’s ululations lest she falsely accuses hundreds of thousands — possibly millions — of Filipino social media users as collectively forming mere “sludge” in what are essentially public fora. She should, like the way she preaches in those “webinars” she gets invited to grace, at least be a bit critical of what she consumes from the Net, right? This is specially in considering that those “peace prizes” are artifacts invented by the very Western European powers her comrades in that “people’s revolution” we keep hearing about being waged in the Philippine countryside rail about for their continued “imperialist” oppression that victimise the peoples of the Third World.
Here’s Maria Ressa in all her ad nauseum glory playing to the chi chi crowd in Oslo…
I didn’t know if I was going to be here today. Every day, I live with the real threat of spending the rest of my life in jail because I’m a journalist. When I go home, I have no idea what the future holds, but it’s worth the risk.
“No idea what that future holds”? Ressa need only (1) consult her lawyers with regard to the prospects of her winning the legal cases she faces once she returns and (2) be a real journalist and put her ear on the ground to get a good picture of the political landscape taking shape in her “home”. Perhaps she can gain enough information to implement some overdue updates to her little playbook and make the public statements she makes about this “home” a bit less insulting to her supposed compatriots. Then maybe she will get better more flattering comments from Filipino social media users. Perhaps then, parrots like Inday Espina Varona will start squawking less lies.",Others
Maria Ressa won her Nobel Peace Prize by being DISHONEST,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/maria-ressa-won-her-nobel-peace-prize-by-being-dishonest/,"The news that Maria Ressa, CEO of Philippine online “news” site Rappler, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee has been met with more disgust than kudos by Filipinos. Those who were disgusted could not fathom how someone who has been spreading fake news and is a convicted felon could manage to receive a supposedly prestigious international award.
Those who were congratulating Ressa claim that she “brought honour to the country”. However, that claim has baffled a lot of Filipinos as well because, firstly, Ressa is also an American citizen and doesn’t even speak Filipino well. Her critics say her loyalty does not lie in the Philippines. That’s not too farfetched considering she didn’t grow up in the country. In fact, Ressa is quite often out of the country on her many PR blitzes or promoting herself and her body of “work”.
Second, Filipinos who are proud of Maria Ressa for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize either do not understand why she received it or don’t care if she painted the Philippines in a negative light before the international community just to win accolades and awards. Ressa once claimed before a 60 Minutes interviewer that “the situation in Manila is far worse than any war zone that I’ve been in”. That was a big fat lie. The situation in Manila was never like a war zone. A foreign journalist by the name of Ted McDonnell was outraged by Ressa’s claim and tweeted that it was “unadulterated bullshit”.  He said he has worked in the Philippines for five years and knows that it is safer than many places in the USA.
Filipinos who do not feel outraged by what Maria Ressa said should have their own loyalties examined. How can they let her lie like that? As Manila Times columnist Rigoberto Tiglao wrote in his column, Ressa was never a war correspondent. It wasn’t like she was on the ground as the fighting was going on. So her claim of being in a war zone was a lie as well.
Ressa would like everyone to believe that she is God’s Gift to Journalism and that she is saving the country from being torn apart. In every interview she has had with foreign journalists, her claim is always the same -– that journalists in the Philippines are “under attack”. It’s a complete fabrication. The truth is, there are Filipino journalists who don’t even like her because she acts like she is so full of herself. One journalist admitted to me that she is not well-liked in the industry. She is not really one of them. I can believe that because she is practically a foreigner. She sees the Philippines through the eyes of an expat. Her stint in ABS-CBN as head of the news division prior to creating Rappler was not great. There was talk of a toxic environment when she was there. Let’s just say that her colleagues did not miss her after she left.
In an recent interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Ressa said the biggest problem in the Philippines is the spread of misinformation. But the biggest source of misinformation in the country is mainstream media. There are journalists who are allied with politicians who publish negative propaganda against rival politicians. This was evident when former President Noynoy Aquino was still campaigning for the Presidency and even more evident during his six-year term. Ressa’s Rappler was a constant source of propaganda against Aquino’s enemies. Rappler kept publishing article after article against Aquino’s perceived enemies like the late former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona. As a matter of fact, it was an article published against Corona that got Ressa and her journalist in trouble with the law.
Ressa’s bias is very evident in the way she criticises current President Rodrigo Duterte. She is relentless in publishing inaccurate articles against him. It wasn’t the case with the previous President. She was kinder and handled Aquino with kids’ gloves. This was odd considering Aquino’s term was disastrous and resulted in thousands of deaths due to his bungling management style. The environment was even more dangerous for journalists during Aquino’s term. I have not heard of journalists being murdered under Duterte’s term. It was only right for National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose to say that Ressa does not deserve her Nobel Peace Prize. Democracy is alive and well in the Philippines and that’s no thanks to Ressa. No journalist is in jail or in trouble just for criticising Duterte. The only reason why Ressa is in trouble is because she broke the law on foreign media ownership and for publishing of libelous content against a private citizen.
It’s disappointing how many foreign journalists fell for Ressa’s exaggerated statements about the real situation in the Philippines. It just goes to show that they will believe anything a fellow foreigner like Ressa would say just because the Philippines is a Third World country. It’s also further proof that a lot of foreign journalists are elitist and do not respect the country’s sovereignty. They prefer to apply their own version of “democracy”. What they don’t realise is each country has its own nuances and capabilities as a society. It is not always black or white.
Maria Ressa’s supporters and those with a misguided sense of national pride are asking why people can’t be happy for her. It’s because she won it by being dishonest. She painted herself as a victim of “oppression” and “tyranny”. The truth is, she has used her publication to terrorise people she personally does not like. The Nobel Prize committee just gave her more ammunition to continue what she does best – to divide and destroy the national fabric of the Philippines. Her Nobel Peace Prize is a big sham, indeed.",Others
"While Leni Robredo’s pink colours and Maria Ressa’s “Peace Prize” flood socmed timelines, those who beg to differ keep silent – for now",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/while-leni-robredos-pink-colours-and-maria-ressas-peace-prize-kudos-flood-socmed-timelines-those-who-beg-to-differ-keep-silent-for-now/,"The lesson “political analysts” and “strategists” seem to have not learnt yet about social media is that it feeds one’s confirmation biases — basically shows you what you want to see. This is specially true of those who block, unfollow, or “unfriend” people in their social networks who express political views different to theirs. As a result, most social media users are left with timelines that all but mirror their personal fantasies because (1) they surround themselves with like-minded “friends” and (2) the algorithms of most social media timelines prioritise content that they like.
What this creates is an illusion of a peachy world that conforms to one’s wishes. Inquirer columnist Joel Ruiz Butuyan is one example of such people who draw conclusions on the bases of what they see on their social media feeds. In his piece today “The tasks ahead for Leni supporters”, he writes of the “dream candidate of the opposition, Vice President Leni Robredo” and how her candidacy for president “generated a stirring momentum from the moment she made the announcement”. He then goes on to write…
For three days from the day she delivered her “Lalaban ako” speech, there was a sea of pink on my Facebook wall. Many of those passionately coming out for Leni on social media are millennials. If this reflects a trend, it bodes very well for her because the youth are a huge chunk of the voting population.
Granted that the admin camp of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte and its outriggers amongst the loose supporter base of former Senator (and now presidential candidate) Bongbong Marcos remain a force to reckon with (and several years of popularity and approval surveys confirm this), it is clear to members of this community that social media is not a safe place to express their political views. The Yellowtards claim ownership over all of Twitter and Facebook is a hive of virtue signalling that characterises much of “polite” conversation. Though inconclusive, there is reason on the part of those of us who are trying to read public sentiment on social media to be conscious of what is not being posted in public forums rather than what is being loudly expressed. Indeed, back in May 2019, Twitter Philippines reported that then senatorial candidate Samira Gutoc “emerged as the most talked about on Twitter during the election season”. That evidently did not translate to votes converted in her favour as, history would soon reveal, she and her eight-candidate “Otso Diretso” coalition would go on to suffer a catastrophic wipe out in that year’s elections despite backing from no less than “vice president” Leni Robredo.
The recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Rappler CEO Maria Ressa also highlights a curiously similar silence amongst her peers in the Philippines’ journalism community. It is common insider knowledge in the industry that many seasoned journalists and members of management teams in established news media organisations in the Philippines regard Maria Ressa with silent contempt. This is not surprising considering how, since the founding of Rappler in 2012, Ressa has crowned herself God’s Gift to Philippine Journalism using, in all ironies, social media to propagate notions of the superiority of her “social news network” operating model over the obsolete (we are told) news reporting models of the country’s more established news and public affairs organisations. Ressa had effectively won this “Peace Prize” at the expense of her professional community and the Philippine government — first by creating a messianic persona that presumes to liberate her industry colleagues from “oppression” and, second, by casting the Philippine government as an “evil” antagonist in a dishonest narrative that she then went on to repeat over and over again to her influential cronies in Western news media organisations.
Like those who beg to take issue with the Yellowtards’ frequent chameleon-like recolouring, quiet-achieving journalists who are are not in the habit of making themselves the subject of their work are all but shamed into even greater depths of silence today. This makes the National Artist F. Sionil Jose a truly courageous soul in how, at risk of being burned at the stake for his views, expressed direct opposition to Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize on Facebook. To this, all “respected” journalist and GMA News Online honcho Howie Severino could respond with is a lame ad hominem…
My opinion as a reader — I’ve read your books and I’ve read Maria’s books. She’s a much better writer.
Your books are hard to finish. Your dialog is stilted and unrealistic. Even your columns contain little to no insight. But I like your bookstore.
Rather than listen, the Philippines’ chattering classes have turned into a Taliban-like lynch mob of book burners and censors — quick to judge, utterly lacking in imagination and curiosity, and guided only by primal tribalism. You’d think you could expect a bit more from private school Katipuneros like Howie Severino, for example. Sadly, for people like him, the thumbs up of a handful of suits appointed by the Norwegian Parliament sitting in conference half a world away trumps the voices of millions of Filipino voters and thousands of their more “ordinary” more professional journalists.",Others
Opposition “thought leaders” want us to believe they will lose the elections because of ignorant voters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/opposition-thought-leaders-want-us-to-believe-they-will-lose-the-elections-because-of-ignorant-voters/,"We’re about 15 years into the age of social media and people. It is part of our lives and much as there are now quarters in society that seek to demonize it, the fact is humanity remains squarely in a trajectory that leads to a world where human behaviour is increasingly guided — very likely driven — by one machine algorithm or another.
Indeed, social media just happens to be the easy most politicised target for vilification. The fact is, however, we have long ago been subservient to algorithms. Think of those traffic lights that guide your driving. We wholeheartedly trust a green light assured that, as it signals us to proceed, it is signalling others to stop and give way to us. Stepping back further, consider other mundane examples. Airplanes carrying hundreds of people are routinely landed by algorithms. Crewmembers of fast food outlets like McDonald’s move to the instructions displayed on monitors by computerised order fulfillment systems. Closer to home, drivers that form the vast on-demand delivery and transport systems of Uber, Grab, and FoodPanda are no better than blind aimless ants derailed from their pheromone trail without the apps through which the system they are a part of direct their actions.
One therefore comes to thinking about these elections. The Philippine Opposition have turned into a chi chi fashion statement the blaming of all their troubles on social media and the bits of “disinformation” (along with “legit” information) that live, breed, and die within its ecosystem. They whine about one partisan camp “weaponising” it to their “nefarious” ends. One wonders though; if it was the Opposition that had been more successful at using social media (which, one needs to be reminded, is a tool available to everyone) to achieve their “disente” ends, would they and their lackeys in Big Corporate “News” Media still describe the way they wielded it with a loaded word like “weaponise”?
A certain Vip Malixi who is a “freelance iOS developer, cartoonist, and writer who covers information technology and psychology” was given a bit of space on the Inquirer today to warn the peasantry about how social media is skewing their world view and issues this pompous lament…
I find this state of things depressing, as the average Joe, indeed, will not bother to make the extra effort to find out what’s what. The result: These social media companies are priming an army of ignorant people, who can be more easily manipulated, to lead our society to god-knows-what ends.
Well now, “priming an army of ignorant people”. Gee, that’s you and me, right? This is the professor suggesting that whoever is losing in these elections are “victims” of “ignorant” voters who were “easily manipulated” by presumably “evil” forces. That’s a convenient excuse for losing elections that is certainly on its way to become an overused one. One wonders if the Opposition led by the Yellowtard bloc have their own social media operations; because if they do have one (and most likely they do have one) then they are hypocrites.
The fact is, the Yellowtards are losing this popularity contest because they did not choose their weapons well and wield what they chose competently. They’re effectively saying that they lost because the enemy fought better — but said in a shrill whiny way. Social media is here to stay and it is evolving at a pace that keeps it five steps ahead of legislation and regulators. Best way to deal with it is to see it for the sword that it is and be a better swordsman in the battles you choose.",Others
Bongbong Marcos’s snub of Jessica Soho scores him a huge PR win and sends ABS-CBN laughing all the way to the bank,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/bongbong-marcoss-snub-of-jessica-soho-scores-him-a-huge-pr-win-and-sends-abs-cbn-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/,"I didn’t watch the Jessica Soho interviews with the “major” Opposition presidential candidates? Why should I? The show is essentially a talk fest with a bunch of losers competing for second place. By declining the invite, Bongbong Marcos actually made a louder more resonant statement than all of his rivals combined.
More importantly, Marcos’s snub of Jessica Soho’s show further highlighted how irrelevant Big Corporate Media has become in these elections. Marcos had, after all, spent decades building his political capital without the benefit of any support — even attracting downright antagonism — not only from the country’s biggest media conglomerates but also from their cronies in Western Europe and North America. Why then would Soho and her newfound Yellowtard fans presume to be the boss of Marcos today?
Rumours are now circulating that the GMA network has lost millions as a result of advertisers backing out from ad slots for Soho’s show. This is still to be confirmed as of this writing but it seems quite plausible. Meanwhile, Marcos reportedly accepted an invitation to be interviewed by ABS-CBN’s Boy Abunda. How’s that for irony? One can imagine ABS-CBN now laughing all the way to the bank with all the ad money Marcos will be pulling in for them.
This is effectively a reverse of roles now. Marcos could be the first Filipino politician who’s succeeded at beating Big Corporate Media at their own game. All this while the Yellowtards are left desperately trying to fashion Soho as a pambansang HR manager likening Marcos as some sort of job applicant refusing to be interviewed for the job he is bidding for. Quite presumptuous that the Yellowtards presume to be an authority on who represents the Filipino people in this episode considering their candidate Leni Robredo’s voter preference rating has consistently lagged Marcos’s by a huge margin in more than a few surveys conducted by several reputable polling firms.
The fact is, GMA and its “talent” Jessica Soho needed Bongbong Marcos more than he needed them. For that matter Robredo and the rest of the Opposition nuisance candidates needed Marcos too. Indeed, the screeching and gnashing of teeth we now spy all over social media is the sound of these bozos and their fantards crying over being deprived of a chance to share a public forum with Marcos. Sad, isn’t it?
Today’s Philippine Opposition is, indeed, a sad sight to behold as their lot have yet again proven, thanks to their behaviour today, that they need Marcos to provide substance to their vacuous rheroric. That would be even sadder than sad if it weren’t for the fact that the way the Opposition conduct themselves today is downright dishonest. Filipinos deserve better than the crooked Opposition personalities we see today and the pathetic campaigns they mount which together amount to not much more than an insult to the Filipino people.",Others
Jessica Soho’s interview of Opposition presidential candidates unlikely to change the course of the elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/jessica-sohos-interview-of-opposition-presidential-candidates-unlikely-to-change-the-course-of-the-elections/,"Who is Jessica Soho anyway? Yellowtards say she is a “multi-awarded” television “journalist”. But then so is Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. Indeed, the latter sports no less than the Nobel “Peace Prize” for being God’s Gift to World “Journalism” last year. That just about trumps anything Soho’s got. And yet, Ressa herself for all the support she and her Rapplerettes extend to the “cause” of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo has delivered zero results as far as the latter’s winnability.
One wonders then what Yellowtard influencers and “activists” are crowing about. The fact is, Bongbong Marcos succeeded at knocking the wind out of what was supposed to be another media coup for the Opposition. The Jessica Soho Show ended up being no more than a lame exhibit of unprecedented political mediocrity. Such a sad cast of characters — a pale reboot of Cory Aquino’s “sacrificial widow” act, a disgraced homophobic boxing champ, a That’s Entertainment alumnus, and Senator Doorknob himself. It’s no wonder the Yellowtards are hopping mad. They were deprived of their entitlement to a Marcos lynching Friday night.
With less than four months of campaign time to go, it gets more and more difficult for the Opposition to be hopeful. All the Yellowtards are doing is upping the volume and frequency of their “Laban Leni” (“fight Leni”) cries. Putting more effort on a failed approach may not exactly be the smartest way forward at this point, but what are the alternatives? Petitioning Marcos’s disqualification from the elections and cancellation of his candidacy had been tried. Demonising him, calling out his father’s “tyranny”, and accusing him of being a thief had become a decades-long tradition. Conspiring with Big Corporate Media to deplatform him only forced Marcos to build a formidable social media machine and amass a vlogging audience on YouTube. Now, a stunt aimed to re-platform him on a GMA Network show hosted by Soho seems to have failed to put even a small dent on his political brand equity.
Unfortunately for the Opposition candidates, the bigger objective here is not to compete with one another for second place. The objective is to present a credible challenge to Marcos. Putting Soho up on a pedestal benefits no one in their lot because Soho had failed to draw Marcos within scope of the Opposition’s arsenal. The only real way to win the presidency is to beat Marcos and it is when one starts to seriously consider this confronting reality that the individuality of each Opposition presidential candidate begins to become irrelevant. Ultimately it is Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte versus all the rest. There is no Leni, no Isko, no Pacman, no Ping. There is only The Opposition versus the Marcos-Duterte tandem.
In short, even this late into the campaign, the idea that only a united opposition can win the day for those who seek to prevent the Second Marcos Presidency looming in the horizon remains a powerful call. The irony here is that to prevent another Marcos presidency, the Opposition need to remove Marcos from their rhetoric and come up with a forward looking platform premised on Marcos being out of the picture. That alone is a near impossibility seeing that Martial Law Crybabyism is woven into the threads that form the very ideological fiber of the Opposition’s leading partisan blocs — the Yellowtards and the communists. Even if, by some miracle, they pull a rabbit out of a hat and come up with a brilliant no-Marcos-included narrative, getting a good number of Filipinos onboard the narrative — which means pulling a big number of them out of Marcos’s gravitational pull — will be an enormous feat of campaign engineering.
What can the Opposition do differently over the next three-plus months to give some basis for hope that an outcome different to where this election is currently headed can be achieved? This is the part where Opposition leaders and their supporters need to start applying a bit of intelligence and originality to their political craft. The challenge is clear. Come up with something that breaks ground and changes minds. It’s simple, really. Trying to solve a problem using the same thinking that created it is borderline insanity. Time for some sober thinking, people of the Opposition!",Others
Bongbong Marcos need not attend any debates either,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/bongbong-marcos-need-not-attend-any-debates-either/,"Imagine a public debate among presidential candidates that does not include administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos. That debate will essentially be between a bunch of vacuous politicians — Leni Roredo, Manny Pacquiao, and Isko Moreno. The only other presidential candidate is Ping Lacson who would stand out as the most intelligent, most articulate, and most seasoned among them. He’ll come up on top of any debate participated in by the other morons hands down. What would that mean for Bongbong Marcos (not considering for now the obvious cost of being labelled “coward” by his critics for declining to participate)? Very likely nothing much. Lacson will end up taking votes away from Robredo, Moreno, and Pacquiao but probably not enough for him to win that second place slot in the race he and his fellow Opposition candidates covet.
Most of the Opposition candidates, after all, have been campaigning for national leadership only over the last couple of months. Robredo could be an exception — because she has been campaigning for the Opposition since 2016 over much of her term as President Rodrigo Duterte’s “vice president”. However, it is evident that all that campaigning did not serve Robredo well seeing that her popularity and trust rating numbers confirmed by several reputable polling firms over the last year or two have not been moved by that campaign. Marcos, on the other hand, has been steadily building his profile and political brand for years, mostly under the radar, mostly dismissed as an unlikely force to contend with until now. Three months of campaign to go does not stack up as significant within the frame of the decades Marcos and his family have invested in building political capital. As such, it is likely that most of his committed supporters — a formidable number that the Opposition have yet to come to terms with — have also been on board with him over similar timeframes.
In short, Marcos’s support base is not composed of casual newly-acquired followers. They are likely long-term followers who have come to know him and what he stands for over time frames measured in years, even decades. In contrast, it is likely that a bigger chunk of the support base of other presidential hopefuls are recent acquisitions who were sold on their candidates’ relatively short-sighted campaigns within the context of just these specific elections. There seems to be no reason for the average Marcos supporter to switch sides on the basis of whether or not their candidate participates in a debate or any other media circus. Indeed, as long-term Marcos supporters, most will by now have thoroughly thought through their support for Marcos. Considering that Marcos’s long-term followers will have, over those periods, followed the routine demonisation Marcos and his family have copped for decades, stood up to the social stigma of being a Marcos supporter, and still remained committed supporters, the likelihood of the emergence over the next three months of any further information or behaviours that would be cause for them to seriously consider changing their minds about Marcos is quite slim. What’s three months in the context of years of long-term committed support, right?
Of course this does not mean debates have no benefit even to a candidate such as Marcos who enjoys a massive lead over the rest of his rival candidates combined. Declining every media event in the next three months is really more an extreme worst-case-scenario on top of which everything else is essentially a bonus to the Marcos campaign. The bottom line is that the Opposition need Marcos more than he needs them. The Media need the ad revenue his presence can pull in and the Opposition need him to be a whipping boy to serve as a smokescreen to their substance-deficited campaigns. Indeed, Robredo in particular needs him the most because she had described her run for the presidency as one that aims to “prevent the return of the Marcoses to Malacañang”. Marcos is actually a major pillar of the Yellowtard ideology that underpins Robredo’s campaign rhetoric.
From hereon, Bongbong Marcos has the luxury to choose his media appearances. It is pure luxury because he already enjoys mass communication channels independent of Big Corporate Media — a network of social media users, a YouTube channel with a massive following, and an alternative community of media and social media personalities who are “friendly” to his cause to whom he could extend the privilege of his presence. Indeed, with today’s technology, even a debate can be organised by any citizen media organisation and this is what is likely behind the defensiveness of traditional media personalities and executives and their continued beholdenness to traditional credentials bestowed top-down by central “committees” (as opposed to credibility built from the grassroots up as what today’s technology allows). The irony here is that the status quo — of central committees, big institutions that monopolise power over information, and public personalities who block dissent — is within the interests of mainly Opposition members, their leaders, and their allies to continue to prop up and sustain. This contradicts much of what they espouse and it is likely that the public have come to realise this.
Does Bongbong Marcos need to go to any further media events such as a public debate? He does not need to but he can if there’s something in it form him. Big Corporate Media personalities can no longer act like gods who presume to summon politicians to their lairs. The Filipino public have taken back that power from them and they only have themselves to blame for abusing the public’s trust for many decades.",Others
Leni Robredo desperately stammers her way through a good Boy Abunda GRILLING!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/leni-robredo-desperately-stammers-her-way-through-a-good-boy-abunda-grilling/,"The only thing Opposition partisans can say about ABS-CBN personality Boy Abunda’s interview of Leni Robredo is that he “interrupted her a lot”. That’s actually not true. Abunda was constantly trying to steer Robredo back on topic and, in most cases, reiterating the question of the segment.
The trouble with Leni Robredo is that she was too reactive to Abunda’s questions which were evidently designed to test the breadth and depth of context that his interviewee would be able to apply in his or her response. An example of Robredo falling into this trap is her responses to Abunda’s questions on how to pay the national debt. In reality, no one president can “pay” the national debt. It can, under his or her watch within his or her term, be serviced and managed to certain economic and fiscal parameters. This is part of the day job of the Secretary of Finance. Rather than stammer through a lame attempt to answer what was clearly a trick question, Robredo could have simply responded by saying the above — that debt servicing be kept reasonable, that debt levels be managed within the frame of forecast economic performance, and that she will work closely with her economic and fiscal managers to achieve these debt management goals. Easy, right?
The most awkward segment of the interview — one that Robredo visibly struggled with and where the profound inconsistency of the ideological underpinnings of her campaign became apparent — was Abunda’s question on abortion. Abortion is a cornerstone of the feminist movement. Feminists are big on this whole “my body my choice” thing. Considering that Robredo’s “pink” campaign theme panders to the feminist community, it is clear that she is allowing her personal Catholic faith to cloud her judgment. Indeed, Robredo’s revelation that she consults a lot with Catholic priests is a red flag. Catholic priesthood is Western civilisation’s most ancient boys’ club. To be consulting men on a matter to do with a woman’s body is a grave mortal sin as far as the feminist movement is concerned.
This is the whole trouble with the Yellowtards. They claim to be liberal and presume to be chummy with the gay community and the feminist movement. However, the Yellowtards’ top leaders are also outwardly prayerful and schmooze a lot with Catholic bishops and priests. The Roman Catholic Church is clear on its position with regard to homosexuality and the sorts of liberal lifestyles and pro-choice philosophies espoused by the gay and feminist communities. All of these run counter to Catholic dogma which is deeply incompatible with liberalism.
Robredo herself admitted in the interview that she finds herself “conflicted” by all this. This is disturbing considering that the Philippines aspires to join the ranks of modern liberal democracies that host societies where tolerance for diversity of lifestyles and life choices is paramount. The Roman Catholic faith is not compatible with this aspiration and Robredo, being a professed devout Catholic cannot claim to be an authentic liberal in this regard.
Fish are caught by the mouth and Robredo had bitten the proverbial hook and was effectively reeled in out of her depth and found herself gasping for oxygen. Perhaps her Yellowtard followers should, instead, be thanking Boy Abunda for interrupting her frequently. If he didn’t, Robredo could have made an even bigger fool of herself and damaged further her already floundering campaign.",Others
An unconventional proposal to save all versions of Filipino democracy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/an-unconventional-proposal-to-save-all-versions-of-filipino-democracy/,"For anyone who has been observing the Philippine political scene long enough, it is not hard to come to the conclusion that regardless of who wins the presidential election, Filipinos will remain the same mediocre, divided, and self-interested collection of disjoint tribes that they’ve always been. The term of Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino was marked by an inability of mainstream media to keep up with successfully covering up its deficiencies and obvious gaffes. The current term of president Rodrigo Duterte is poised to end unable to live up to its full potential of “change” – in no small part because the elites of Imperial Manila did their utmost to obstruct it.
Whichever side you stand on the political fence, Filipinos have in common that they see their politicians as sort of godfathers, mga ninong, who shower them with gifts and favors before, during, and after the elections. Self-interest is a great motivation; the rich want “concessions” and influence that will make them richer, while the poor want the freebies that will get them thru every single day without damaging the “budget”.
The “decent” crowd – now AKA the Pinklawans, Pinktards, Pinkoloids, anything but Yellowtards – are clinging to their choice of Leni Robredo for president – buy, buy, MUST WIN – in order to salvage whatever is left of their clout and precious collective political ego. On social media platforms, despite having the weight of conveniently-placed assets to silence opinions they don’t agree with, they have been largely unsuccessful in totally cancelling out the DDS – the Diehard Duterte Supporters – and continue to be met with a ferocity that has led them to cry “our dissent is being silenced”, when all they mean to say is that, they’ve been so used to the privilege of having the last word on things that the loss of it feels like oppression. What complicates things for the Pinkoloids are the supporters – long-time or recent – of the Marcoses, particularly the presidential aspirant Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., who have ridden the momentum of the sliding irrelevance of the Liberal Party (LP) to come out in a “safer space”.
On the other side of the track, the DDS may have the numbers – or so the surveys say – but they have little socio-political weight even after five years of being the dominant force. They lack a large-scale communications infrastructure, which is why Duterte, his administration, and his supporters are left at the mercy of mainstream media to be misrepresented, and their words twisted, to give unwitting audiences the impression that things in the Philippines are worse than they actually are. It is still also more socially accepted in certain areas of the country to cancel/ostracize DDS in real life; by the virtue of “whom you’re connected to”, Duterte’s offensiveness will carry over to you as a supporter. Duterte’s supporters may not have the snooty air or the inability to step out of their echo chambers that the “disente” do, but they turn off the non-aligned just the same by being irrationally hostile towards any criticism of Tatay Digong, especially the warranted ones.
Suffice to say, both the LP’s supporters and the DDS most likely overestimate the number of live bodies they have on their side. When we focus on the presidential election next year, however, the mood this early indicates that Bongbong Marcos, or Sara Duterte if she decides to be a substitute, will win, and that Leni Robredo and any remnants of the LP will lose – if the Liberal Party competes fair and square. – a big if. Duterte and Marcos supporters, on the other hand, assume that people will fall into line and forget all the offensiveness associated with their candidates when they win.
Robredo’s win in the vice-president elections last 2016 remains unconvincing for a portion of the electorate. On the other hand, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has been perceived for quite some time as too lenient on the skullduggery of the Liberal Party; the DDS and Marcos supporters may just find out the hard way, again, that, more than the votes, it’s who counts the votes that count. Regardless of who wins this election, certain bad blood (sama ng loob) will remain unresolved, and Filipinos will still be divided. The social conditions will result in a stalemate where everybody loses.
I believe, however, that the DDS and the Pinklawans can actually reach a compromise. Hence the following proposal.
As previously mentioned, in a fair fight Leni Robredo will most likely lose; Duterte and Marcos supporters, against all odds, will not allow a repeat of 2016 to happen. The agreement they can reach is that the Pinklawans get to keep their deluded self-righteousness and “entitlement” to label their political enemies all manners of “stupid”, but in return, they forfeit the election immediately, and all privilege to comment on politics in any medium they share with their political enemies. To extend this proposal even further, the Lenitards can have their own, Liberal Party-dominant piece of land, consider themselves seceded from the bigger Republic of the Philippines, and run it according to their own inoffensive, West-friendly principles/ideology. The rest of the Philippines will be run according to the vision of a Duterte-Marcos “dream team” that their supporters have. A “friendly” competition can even be staged to see who has developed the farthest after a certain number of years!
What happens to those who identify neither as Pinktards, or DDS? Sorry, Filipinos have already decided your side for you; if you criticize Leni, you’re a Dutertard. If you criticize Digong or Bongbong, you’re a Yellowtard. It’s up to you where you want to be lumped.
Go forward with Duterte, or stew in the past with the Liberal Party – Filipinos leave themselves little choice.
Filipinos have demonstrated time and again that they excel when they’re apart, rather than when they work together. It’s a win-win deal.
Your move, Philippines.

Angelica Panganiban video “teaching” Filipino voters to think critically actually insults their intelligence,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/angelica-panganiban-video-teaching-filipino-voters-to-think-critically-actually-insults-their-intelligence/,"In her latest video pushed out to millions of others by no less than Pinoy Big Brother alumna Bianca Gonzalez, showbiz starlet Angelica Panganiban shares some of her original insight on the sort of thinking Filipino Voters ought to be applying when choosing their candidate for the upcoming elections.
https://twitter.com/iamsuperbianca/status/1488489013535076353
Panganiban’s message is ironic because celebrity endorsements (whether that be of a product or an idea) are meant to evoke an emotional response and don’t necessarily reach their audience’s higher intellectual faculties — the ones used for critical thinking. Many are quick to point out that the idea of voting “wisely” is not new and Panganiban is merely “reminding” everyone of this important aspect of exercising one’s democratic duty this coming May. However, the fact is, there is a reason Panganiban lending weight to this trite idea (and fellow celebs like Gonzalez further anointing these artefacts) is important. It is because celebrities possess the personal gravitas to evoke the strongest emotional responses from the most number of people. This is why they earn the big bucks.
Filipinos should “vote wisely” because, I, Angelica Panganiban, said so. This is basically how the starlet comes across to her audience who, in turn, lap it all up with glee. They are, after all, not called “fantards” for nothing. The reality of the human condition is that the inclination to defer to a person of perceived authority on a subject matter is instinctive. This is why cults are prevalent and why religion remains such a powerful organising force. Celebrities are cults of personality and fandoms are fundamentally religions at their core. Fans effectively protect their idols from any scrutiny that may boomerang on them. They do this with a fervour that is can also be observed in how religious zealots go on “crusades” to further the greater glories of their gods.
By presuming to preach the merits of critical thinking when making choices, Panganiban invites scrutiny. Thus the obvious question is raised: Does this starlet have enough credibility to lecture people on the science of making rational choices? In the above video, for example, Panganiban advises the madla to “closely examine those who seek to earn your affections”. When said in Tagalog as Pangilinan does in the video — “kilatising mabuti ang mga manliligaw” — this alludes to romantic relationships.
Do recall, however, that Pangilinan wasn’t as lucid as she she is now when referring to her own experience with men. Just last year, Pangilinan shared this rather incoherent account of her personal struggles with matters of the heart and the sorts of angst these caused her.
“Parang di ko alam kasi sumuko din naman ako. Umabot din naman ako sa point na ayoko na. Parang nakakapagod na rin yung relasyon. Magsisimula ka na naman, kikilalanin mo, e-estimahin mo, pakikisamahan mo so parang hay nakakapagod yan tapos hindi mo alam kung ano yung pinapasok mo, eto na ba yun or masasaktan ka lang ulit? Para kang tumatalong… para kang mag-bu-bungee jumping or tatalon ka sa eroplano, ganun yung pakiramdam niya na parang, wala kung hindi ko ito gagawin manghihinayang ako. Choice siya eh. Lahat naman tayo may choice. Parang, ano bang gusto mo? Masaya ka na mag-isa o masaya ka na meron kang kasama?” Angelica Panganiban said.
All that might make a bit more sense (to some extent) when translated in English:
“It’s like I did not know, I too surrendered. It got to a point that I did not want anymore. Relationships have become exhausting. You start again, you get to know, you size them up, you work at getting along; it’s a lot of effort and yet you still don’t know what you are getting into. Is this where you get hurt again? It’s like a leap of fate; like bungee jumping or jumping off an airplane. That’s how it feels like; like, if you don’t do it you’ll end up regretting not doing it. It’s a choice, see. All of us have choices; like, what do you really want? Are you happy alone or are you happy being with someone?”
Not quite a lucid take on the human condition, right? It’s a far cry from the contrived, scripted confidence she exudes in that politically-motivated video making waves all over social media today. Panganiban, after all, is an actress — evidently one who is good at memorising scripts but, perhaps, not as articulate when thinking on the fly. This is the whole trouble with the Yellowtard campaign. Filipinos see through the bells and whistles its strategists use as a smokescreen to mask the reality that it is all but bankrupt of substance and authenticity. One thing Panganiban’s performance in the video succeeds at is in capturing the essence of the character of the Yellowtard campaign so well.",Others
"History repeats itself: how Maria Ressa, like Aguinaldo, Paterno and Buencamino, sold Filipinos out to FOREIGN colonial powers",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/history-repeats-itself-how-maria-ressa-like-aguinaldo-paterno-and-buencamino-sold-filipinos-out-to-foreign-colonial-powers/,"National artist for literature F. Sionil Jose has been copping a lot of flak for his audacity in stating that Maria Ressa does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. He has been maligned by prominent personalities and “thought leaders” of the Opposition. Some of them actually have questionable provenances with regard to their prominence. These half-assed prominent personalities don’t even bother to distinguish in their criticism. Sionil Jose is a national artist for literature. If ever he would be awarded a Nobel, it would be for literature not for “peace”.
What exactly has Ressa done to advance the cause of peace? It’s not like the Philippines is a failed state such as Syria or Libya, both of which were the doing of the US pushing with regime-change during the Arab Spring. Ressa’s fans can only claim the “harassment” of Rappler by the government but Rappler remains open. They lump in the denial of a franchise for ABS-CBN without taking into account the fact that a franchise is a privilege, not a right. The sole basis for Ressa’s prize is her “standing up” to President Rodrigo Duterte — a narrative that is largely of her own making. I doubt that the President is bothered by Rappler and Ressa. The cases are pending in the courts. The last libel suit against Rappler and Ressa was settled. It didn’t come to a judgment. What stands is her previous conviction, which is under appeal. In short, she’s being given due process under the law.
What’s dangerous now is how low the quality of our public intellectuals are. If the defenders of Ressa aren’t capable of civil discourse then what’s the point? The fact that they mostly resort to argumentum ad hominem, as noted broadcast journalist Howie Severino did when he criticised Jose’s writing style without addressing the points he made, only proves that their intellectual capacity is lacking. But this is usually the case when your position is weak and indefensible. What’s more dangerous is there is no journalist worth his or her salt who would dare go against Ressa and Rappler. The facts behind Rappler’s funding by Pierre Omidyar are there for all to read. It is not a white paper but supported by facts because Rappler and Ressa did receive the monies. If Duterte really wanted to pin down Ressa, he would’ve been able to do so, one way or the other.
What is more disturbing is the hypocrisy that accompanies the Ressa defense. She isn’t even a Filipino citizen to begin with. In fact, she is a foreign agent operating in the country and openly challenging the government. Condoning this act is treason. But never mind. What is important is the largesse flows to those in and around Maria — she who has been praised by Biden, Obama and Bono. Proof that, up to today, Filipinos are content to suffer the fools of the past; Aguinaldo, Paterno and Buencamino, who murdered the true patriots and sold us out to foreigners. We are such pathetic idiots if we will condone these acts of treason and not take a stand against it.",Others
"By acting like an idiot in a TikTok video, Leni Robredo proves she sees the masses as a bunch of idiots",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/by-acting-like-an-idiot-in-a-tiktok-video-leni-robredo-proves-she-sees-the-masses-as-a-bunch-of-idiots/,"Opposition partisans associated with the “leading” Yellowtard bloc within it that directly support the presidential candidacy of “vice president” Leni Robredo are scrambling to justify the thinking behind a recent spate of low-brow campaign materials that have gone “viral” — for the wrong reasons. Partisan camps opposed to the Yellowtards are having a field day converting these ill-thought-out campaign graphics and videos into memes that, themselves, are going viral — for the right reasons. A particularly ill-thought-out piece of campaign collateral that somehow made it into the public space and caused a monumental cringe is a TikTok video of Robredo doing some sort of interpretative dance to communicate her so-called “platform”.
While these stunts attracted a tidal wave of ridicule from communities aligned with the administration camps, they also elicited serious inward reflection from within Opposition circles. Some Yellowtard partisans and “activists” expressed dismay over how these stunts may actually be setting back the “cause” and bringing across the wrong message to voters whose preferences they seek to convert to their camp.
Opposition volunteers coming to the defense of these cringeworthy campaign materials argue that the bigger base of voters come from the lower-income C, D, and E crowd over which these sorts of low-brow entertainment are traditionally expected to resonate. This is a typical perspective taken by chi chi private school types and Big Corporate Media execs who see the lower classes as worthy of no more than trashy entertainment and over-simplified messaging that reveals the condescending or patronising way with which the social elite regard them. Esteemed dermatologist, presumed “beauty” expert, and “human rights” advocate Winlove Mojica asserts in a recent tweet…
Napakaliit ng botante sa Class ABC kumpara sa D and E.
Kaya nga ang mga activities ng mga kakampink ay karaniwang nasa kalsada at hindi sa mga malls tulad ng Powerplant Rockwell kasi nasa kalsada ang target audience.
Nasa kalsada ang mga botong magpapanalo kay VP.
Translated: “The ABC class represent a small subset of Filipino voters compared to the D and E classes. This is why KakamPink campaign activities are performed in the streets and not in malls like Power Plant in Rockwell because the target audience are on the streets. The people who will account for the VP’s victory are on the streets.”
Logic like these can be interpreted in many ways but one thing’s certain. A presidential candidate acting like an idiot in a video because she seeks an audience with the poor may just as well be saying that the poor are idiots. The irony in all this is in how the Yellowtards had, for so long, crowned themselves “champions” of “democratic ideals”. In these instances, they are coming out first in perverting the spirit of democracy by using dishonest and intelligence-insulting measures in their desperate efforts to gain traction with a public that had long ago issued an indictment of just about everything they stand for.
In an age where Facebook is being taken to task for feeding trash to its hapless users, it comes across as a bit of a laugh that a community known for their shrill whining about all the “disinformation”, “trolls”, spam, and clickbait that pollute social media are, themselves, engaged in the production of this sort of rubbish. In her piece “I Made the World’s Blandest Facebook Profile, Just to See What Happens” published on The Atlantic, Kaitlyn Tiffany writes of the outcome of her experiment…
After just two weeks on the platform, consuming only content that Facebook’s recommendation systems selected for me, I found myself at the bottom of a rabbit hole not of extremism but of utter trash—bad advice, stolen memes, shady businesses, and sophomoric jokes repeated over and over. Facebook isn’t just dangerous, I learned. It doesn’t merely have the ability to shape offline reality for its billions of users. No, Facebook is also—and perhaps for most people—senseless and demoralizing.
Want to cleanse your timelines of trashy content that Leni Robredo’s campaign are polluting it with? Take some advise from communist activist Katrina Stuart-Santiago…
…after I removed myself from the Leni campaign groups, my newsfeed on FB has ceased to be pink. I took only about 10 days for that algorithm to change, and it’s an important thing to consider whenever you think, or imagine, that the numbers on our side are growing, or that there is “public clamor” for anything at all. Know that algorithms make us think that, for a reason.
If we want an intelligent vote prevailing in these elections, we need to remove not just the noise but the crap from the discourse. We can start with our respective social media timelines and we can follow-through by calling out people like Leni Robredo who actually produce and propagate crap. It’s really that simple.",Others
Five things that are wrong about Leni Robredo’s campaign for President,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/five-things-that-are-wrong-about-leni-robredos-campaign-for-president/,"Philippine Vice President Leonor “Leni” Robredo is going to get a rude shock when she loses the 2022 Presidential Election to former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr (BBM). She’s going to be shocked because she is living in a bubble. Her supporters and allies from mainstream media are hiding the truth from her — that the voters do not like her and do not want her to be President.
Her supporters probably choose to protect her from the reality on the ground because they are afraid she might lose her motivation to run for President. They need not worry. It is very unlikely for Robredo to give up the fight against BBM. Aside from Robredo being dense, this fight has become personal for her. It will be embarrassing for her to lose to BBM after he lost his electoral protest (it’s more like the electoral tribunal sat on his protest until it got stale) against her in the 2016 elections for Vice President.
It’s going to take a miracle by the name of Andres Bautista or some sort of divine intervention from Uncle Sam to stop a “Marcos return” to Malacanang. BBM has been consistently at the top of popularity surveys, enjoying a very big gap between him and all the other nuisance candidates. Yes, everybody else — including Robredo — are nuisance candidates. Robredo in particular has become the country’s laughingstock because of the antics she performs just to attract voters. Her PR team is evidently not the best and the brightest of the lot. They make her do silly things in their misguided effort to get the C and D crowd or, in their own words, the “bakya” crowd on their side. They really got it all wrong. There are a lot of problems with Robredo’s campaign strategy. Let us enumerate them.
1. Robredo’s PR team comes up with the lamest ideas to sell her to the public.
Her PR team made her appear in various TikTok videos where her goofing off in these had disastrous consequences for her campaign. She’s tried being a stand-up comic with her VP tandem Senator Kiko Pangilinan, she’s tried performing a Hadouken against words, and she’s guested on a social media show hosted by a supposedly popular dude who just made her look stupid. All of her performances and guest appearances were cringe-worthy. They only made good fodder for meme creators feasting on her vacuousness.
2. Robredo’s rabid supporters are elitist.
A lot of Robredo’s supporters are either socialites or social climbers who want to be like the socialites. These people are self-righteous and expect the rest of Philippine society to think and behave like them. They also claim to be pious and decent. The problem with their behaviour is they turn off the “bugoy” or rugged crowd. Their attempts at trying to reach the people from the lower classes just comes across as condescending. Proof of this is when they gave out small packs or rice with fish sauce for making congee or “lugaw”.
What kind of people comes up with stuff like that?!? It’s an insult to people who don’t have anything to eat or to those who need to eat more nutritious food but just can’t afford to.
3. Going from yellow to pink was the first and worst decisions Robredo’s team made.
They wanted to make a statement by changing their colour motif but the only statement this made was to prove that the yellow colour or the Liberal Party brand is dead and could not be revived after two successive losses in previous elections.
4. They don’t learn from their mistakes.
Robredo’s camp is the very definition of stupidity. They keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result every time. Robredo’s campaign manager seems to only want to spend the money allotted for advertising and PR companies as fast as he could. Those people are laughing all the way to the bank while making Robredo look like a fool.
Really, these people should have learned from Mar Roxas’s PR stunts. However, they instead tried to copy his failed campaign strategy.
5. The main problem with Robredo’s campaign strategy is Robredo herself.
She is just not cool. Granted that her PR team does not give her much to work with, Robredo’s execution is simply pathetic just the same. A natural performer can actually pull off corny stuff. Robredo’s performance is just too forced. It is just not her. She wants to appear comedic but her timing is bad. The average man on the street does not buy it.
Robredo is too dumb to realise too that she is being made to appear stupid in every one of these PR stunts. She is basically the problem of her campaign.
* * *
No one from Robredo’s camp is prepared to admit that despite being the Vice President and having been the Darling of the Media for six years, Robredo is still not popular with the voters. Their top honchos blame everything and everybody else except her, her PR team, and her supporters for their dismal popularity ratings. Robredo is simply a hard sell and no amount of money poured in to PR companies and advertising agencies can help her.",Others
John Nery defends his new boss Maria Ressa against national artist F Sionil Jose’s opinion about her Nobel “Peace Prize”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/john-nery-defends-his-new-boss-maria-ressa-against-national-artist-f-sionil-joses-opinion-about-her-nobel-peace-prize/,"A writer’s problem is to find a topic and effectively convey the message he wants to impart to his audience. Substance comes first then style. The subtlety or the loudness of the prose, depends on the subject in relation to the audience. It is for this reason that it is hard for any writer to marry journalism with creative writing. I’ve come to admire only two writers who have been able to do so; Nick Joaquin and national artist F. Sionil Jose (FSJ).
Former Inquirer editor John Nery (now a Rapplerette at “social news network” Rappler) devoted his maiden piece for Twitter newsletter service Revue to a defense of his new boss CEO Maria Ressa. In “A reply to F. Sionil Jose”, Nery takes aim at the umbrage FSJ took over Ressa’s award of this year’s Nobel “Peace Prize”. Nery first issues full disclosure of his close relationship with FSJ who, at one time, honoured him by writing a foreword for his book Revolutionary spirit : Jose Rizal in Southeast Asia. He then goes on to elaborate on what he describes as Jose’s “ungrounded, uncharitable, unbecoming criticism of Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize.”
Nery takes the low road attempting a point-by-point debunk over much of his newsletter of FSJ’s arguments against Ressa’s “Peace Prize” and the place she imagines herself to hold in the Philippines journalism community. In the end, however, he gravitates, like the loyal underling, to his boss’s hollow template thesis…
F. Sionil Jose does not share the experience of a great many journalists in the Philippines who struggle with the effects of democratic decay almost every day: newsrooms intimidated by Duterte’s violence, reporters who work with public officials who internalize Duterte’s bias against the press, audiences that have turned aggressively hostile under Duterte’s influence, subjects and sources (especially those from outside the administration) who have been demonized by Duterte and his many agents.
Nery has a difficult time debunking claims made by the national artist because they have basis in facts. Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize is based on the opinion of the five-member Nobel committee and her journalist-activist colleagues in the country and abroad, who agree on one point; populist leaders have no place in their democratic space as they define it, regardless of what the public sentiment is. Never mind that Duterte is a duly-elected President of the Republic and never mind that Maria Ressa’s opinion isn’t shared by the greater majority of Filipinos. Never mind that Maria Ressa herself, is not a bonafide Filipino citizen.
One then wonders what Nick Joaquin’s opinion of Maria Ressa’s Nobel Prize would be. What of Louie Beltran? Max Soliven? The still living Eggie Apostol? Larry Henares? These are journalists who called it as they saw it. Beltran and Henares went at then President Cory Aquino from the beginning. It was His Immensity, as Henares baptized Beltran, who first came out with his parody columns on the Republic of Banana, its insulares, peninsulares, parian, the Council of Trent, and the Opus Dei. These were the days when journalists had principles and stood up for them. They also left it to the public to be the judge of the news, except for the time of Ferdinand Marcos when all of them were against him for having the audacity to shut them down during martial law.
Nery is actually indulging himself in a bit of creative writing with his depiction of journalists belonging to leftist-militant groups who have been detained and charged by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Up to today, the liberals still can’t get it in their heads that an insurgency is a war against the government and the government has the right to defend itself within the bounds of law. The Nobel Prize for Maria Ressa couldn’t have come at a better time. The Opposition has made it an election issue and so it’s up to the people to judge the politicians who have come out in support of Ressa. But it does say a lot when Rappler is one of the least trusted news outlets in the country today.
Rappler will not close down anytime soon. Not for lack of funds because it is amply funded by foreign interests. What does it say about its journalists when they can’t recognize this fact? The paycheck and the status in exchange for their patriotism is the deal, it seems. There is that oft-repeated maxim that rich Filipinos want to become Spaniards while poor Filipinos want to become Americans. The slap in the face of Duterte, as they claim, is also a collective slap on the Filipinos who voted him into office. Nery and Ressa should be wary because these Filipinos might just slap them back on election day.",Others
Incoming PCOO Head Trixie Cruz Angeles is Showing She’s Way Above Her Pay Grade and Other Emerging Appointment Booboos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/incoming-pcoo-head-trixie-cruz-angeles-is-showing-shes-way-above-her-pay-grade-and-other-emerging-appointment-booboos/,"On the matter of getting appointed to a cabinet position or government agency under the incoming second Marcos administration, it does well to behave with the humility and restraint of my best friend’s Aunty, Dr. Clarita Carlos.
Yes, that one.
When I came across an excel sheet that had the name of a government agency in one column and next to it was her name, I congratulated her.
She responded, “Paul, (it’s) just a list… hahaha!”
(I could probably write another blog on the significance of ellipses-followed-by-hahaha in everyday exchanges on instant messaging apps, but I’ll leave that digression for another time.)
If she had been mayabang or arrogant as some had depicted her to be, my guess is she would have hinted one way or another that she was up for a different position.
She’s sharp and feisty, sure. And this could sometimes be interpreted by the usual timid and meek looking Pinoy as mapagmataas. Sure!
But, I don’t think I have ever seen her count her chicks in public before they hatched in the way some other BBM appointees have — which to me, is pagmamayabang.
In fact, I’ve known her to almost always only say way much less than what she knows and this is the reason why I was pleasantly surprised when word spread that a certain Dr. Carlos was appointment as our incoming National Security Adviser.
I haven’t read much else said about her appointment or any word about how she is organizing the National Security Council Secretariat. I tend to believe that, owing to the nature of the office as well as Dr. Clarita’s character, little else will be said.
Because, after all, between the announcement and the rigors of getting the final green light from the Committee on Appointments is still quite a stretch.
Not a time to be seen doling out positions and favors.
In sharp contrast, the appointment of Trixie Cruz Angeles as the head of the Presidential Communications Operations Office caused quite a bit of a stir even before it was officially announced.
Before it was announced, friends in BBM’s camp were mentioning Angeles along with Ambassador Bobi Tiglao. Not a few figured that Tiglao would head the PCOO while Angeles would become one of the Presidential spokespersons.
As much as I find Tiglao’s tirades sometimes way out there and at other times too harsh, I’ve grown quite used to it and believe that what comes across in various media is fairly authentic. He’s a mean and cranky old man just like a couple of my friends and myself — that’s probably why I like him.
(I would have preferred Ambassador Babe Romualdez for the position but I’ve heard he’s up to replace Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin.)
If Tiglao had been appointed as the PCOO Secretary, it would have definitely struck fear in the hearts of BBM’s committed detractors.
Angeles on the other hand… hahaha!
Well, a disclaimer might be appropriate at this point. I met her and “worked” with her at a friend’s boutique PR firm way back in 2009. My friend said she was helping his PR firm with legal work as a consultant and also brought in some crisis management clients.
Back then, my impression was that apart from her work as an attorney for some people, she also contracted the services of PR firms and freelance publicists/journalists.
I even sat at a meeting where matters were discussed about an ongoing somewhat legal dispute between a shopping mall and local government unit. In the flow of discussions, there was an impression that Angeles was guiding both sides of the dispute in the way that US arms manufacturers aid fledgling democratic governments and freedom fighters.
An old blog post by a former colleague at RPN9 seems to describe the situation better than I can from my own recollection. In this post, the writer seems to have re-posted an account of Angeles’ dealings by Argee Guevarra — a former business partner of Angeles:
Sometime in May 2009, we accepted Gotesco mall owners’ request for us to render politico-legal services to prevent Caloocan City Mayor Recom Echiverri from gaining control and possession of the disputed mall. On the eve of the well-publicized takeover, she informed me that she will meet with some representatives of Recom. This supposed meeting was arranged by Amiel Cabanlig (a gay, bayaran blogger who always attacks PNoy in www.donavictorina.com and whose claim to social importance is bragging about his being a ka-chongkee and ka-cocaine of Mike Defensor).
I asked her why she needs to meet representatives of Recom and she informed me that Recom’s group wants to “pay us off” so that we abandon our clients. I allowed her to meet with the representatives but only to listen and spy as to their intentions and tactics. I gave her strict orders not to accept or make any deal that would compromise our existing attorney-client relationship with Gotesco Mall owners.
A week later, we were able to accomplish our tasks for which we received partial payment for our attorney’s fees.
Weeks after the Gotesco mall incident and considering my unwillingness to follow-up on the full payment of our attorney’s fees from the notoriously stingy and shrewd Gotesco mall owners, I just assigned the task to Trixie.
At around that time, she introduced to me her supposed estranged “husband” Atty. “Estanislao” Bong Angeles, a Utopia fraternity brod of Recom who approached me and who came up with a story about some Commission on Audit finding that he said could coerce or compel the Gotesco mall owners into paying us our remaining balance.
Since I don’t understand much about audit procedures, I just referred Trixie to my contacts in Gotesco mall and even accompanied her once to a meeting where nothing was actually accomplished because Trixie was herself vague of her husband’s idea or did not understand the importance of this supposed COA finding.

She has probably evolved much more since then.
Somehow, she must have cozied up with the Pnoy Administration and became Vice Chairman of the National Committee on Monuments and Sites.
Perhaps as a sign of her fealty to the Yellow Lord born by Yellow Saint Cory, she even tweeted back in February 25, 2013 that “True justice is when we see at least Imelda Marcos in jail.”
The Tweet received a number of comments and the most striking one was from a certain Bettina Monfort who said, “The son did not have anything to do with what his father did but might be punished for it.”
To which she retorted, “Not true that he did not have anything to do with the father. He uses ill gotten wealth. That is complicity after the fact.”
Since then, she became not only a social media influencer, but also a talk radio personality as well as a columnist — if I am not mistaken. Her successful foray in media might have been somewhat necessitated by her three year suspension by the Supreme Court in 2016.
There was even a point where she was or seemed to be the adviser for Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson and I am not sure that worked out well, if at all. If memory serves me correctly, this was the time when Asec. Uson got embroiled in a number of controversies which I would rather not enumerate because it seems to have flowed from one into another.
Aaaaand now she’s the PCOO Secretary designate.
If at all, her appointment is a sign that BBM is remaining true and committed to his campaign slogan of UNITY and it should be welcomed… nay! APPLAUDED!
I mean, why not? Was it not said by Abraham Lincoln or whoever that “I destroy by enemies by making them my friends.”
Angeles’ team mates, I overheard, confoundingly credit BBM’s largesse rather than Angeles’ prowess as a lawyer and communicator.
With a budget reportedly amounting to P1.9 billion, giving the PCOO to Angeles is INDEED an act of Marcosian largesse approaching almost legendary proportions.
That’s really far from the days when she was supposedly ousted by her law classmates when photocopying money supposedly in her care disappeared. Oh well, I don’t think the PCOO needs to outsource its photocopying requirements… or does it? We shall see.
Imagine, instead of having her shot in the face, having all her silicone parts wrenched from her body, or water tortured in the Pasig River for calling for BBM and his mother’s imprisonment, he does the complete opposite and gives her a plum position.
Which makes Angeles’ teammates envy understandable because they’re the ones I overheard talking about how she already earned the ire of one of BBM’s biggest political and financial supporters.
The story goes that Angeles received a call from the fuming Bigtime BBM supporter and I imagined her disintegrating under the hail of curse words coming from the other end of the line.
Anyway, according to Angeles’ team mate the caller was supposed to have said, “Trixie, I heard that you are appointing someone in PTFOMS. Is it true? Akin yan! Hindi PCOO yan.”
PTFOMS or the Presidential Task Force on Media Security was organized to help journalists who are under threats of harm or intimidation arising from reporting on illegal activities.
Angeles was said to have mumbled some sort of explanation but the Bigtime BBM Supporter just shouted back, “NO. That’s just what I want you to know.”
Thing is, according to Trixie’s teammate, she was not at all aware of how the PCOO is organized and how it works alongside other government agencies with functions ancillary to the Presidential communications.
As far as I understand, PTFOMS is under the Office of the President and works alongside PCOO. It is an essential component of a larger media policy implementation program designed to promote press freedom. In my mind, the Duterte media policy program includes the Freedom of Information Project Management Office.
Angeles’ teammate further explains that what caused her to go out of bounds in “handing out positions” was that her media cronies were bugging her none stop.
Thing is, and this is a crucial point, Angeles doesn’t yet have any power to hand out or even promise any position to anyone.
That’s not only counting chicks before they’re hatched, it’s selling a tray of eggs as lechon manok and apparently, someone bought the whole lot!
As it turns out, a group that wants to place one of its lackeys as the head of PTFOMS has been attacking the agency’s performance and propping up the profile of one Edu Punay as a replacement for the current PTFOMS head.
Edu Punay is reporter for the Philippine Star and Angeles’ teammate says he feels entitled to head the PTFOMS because he had printed one or two stories favorable to BBM.
A screenshot sent to me shows one of Punay’s friends congratulating him prematurely for being designated as PTFOMS head. It would not be unimaginable that Angeles or Punay may have spread the word of the designation way too early.
This did not sit well with the REAL transition committee, the one actually in charge of vetting the appointments for various positions in the BBM cabinet.
The actual words were, “Hindi pala nila alam yung ginagawang encroachment ni Trixie sa powers ng Office of the President. Bakit daw pinapangakuan ng position and nagpaplaning mag reorganize when hindi niya sakop yun and wala siyang power to appoint.”
In not so many words, pointed remarks were made about Punay’s eager beaver attitude towards getting a post.
Angeles teammate reveals, “Punay’s team resorted to all kinds of dirty tricks to blighten the record of PTFOMS. Even coming out with an editorial in a tabloid kung saan connected si Punay. Obvious na galaw niya.”
It was also said that Punay disparaged and belittled the current head of the PTFOMS, saying “wala siya sa kalingkingan ko.”
That’s the thing with some journos working for big media outfits, they inadvertently identify as the media outfit as if they had built it from the ground up. Colleagues of his from way back say that Punay wouldn’t have a had a headline story or a noteworthy byline if it hadn’t been enterprised by other reporters FIRST or leaked to him by very friendly sources.
Apart from Punay’s media campaign for the PTFOMS appointment, Angeles’ teammate also reveals that Punay pressured the reported PCOO Secretary designate by resigning from his media outfit. (Then again, I guess Punay might have been pressured as well by his media outfit to resign or get fired for moonlighting as a PR freelancer. It is unethical to work as a publicist while employed as a journalist.)
Word coming from another source is that Trixie may be on their way out even before they she officially steps in as PCOO Secretary.

Why Maria Ressa when there are thousands of REAL FILIPINO journalists who practice their craft HONESTLY?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/why-maria-ressa-when-there-are-thousands-of-real-filipino-journalists-who-practice-their-craft-honestly/,"Think about this for a moment. There are hundreds of thousands of brilliant Filipino journalists many of whom go about their craft quietly and leave it up to their work to speak on their behalf. And then there is Maria Ressa. Maria Ressa gets to fly off to Oslo to receive her “peace prize”, hobnob with a who’s-who of wokedom’s US-backed finest, and laugh all the way to the bank with more than a million dollahs in prize money. You gotta hand it to Maria Ressa. Well done. She’s just the latest of many Americans who had come before her who had made a million bucks off their “little brown brothers”.
In her speech in Oslo this weekend, Maria Ressa crowned herself “representative of every journalist around the world who is forced to sacrifice so much to hold the line”. How much exactly has Ressa “sacrificed”? Doesn’t seem like much seeing her standing before the cameras halfway around the world courtesy of her latest junket. She also has an American passport, which means she has a lifeline back to ol’ Uncle Sam’s embrace where Julian Assange, the man she threw under the bus to get where she is today may be extradited soon. Indeed, there is not much evidence — no facts — to support her claim before the world that the Philippines is a “war zone” or a piece of hell specifically reserved for “journalists”.
Where then does that leave real Filipino journalists — you know, the ones who actually produce great works of journalism instead of making themselves the news? There are, after all, hundreds of thousands of them. The best of them publish brilliant very readable work on the Philippines’ major publications and news outlets. They don’t have as much name recall as Maria Ressa, but we know their work when we see and read them. Well, they will be left with a profession “represented” by Maria Ressa and her sophomoric team at Rappler. Never mind that Filipino journalism boasts an excellent tradition that goes back a hundred-odd years. They have Rappler which, along with its CEO, bubbled up to the surface of the muck that is Yellowtard chatter just nine years ago in time for the demonization of the late former Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012 to represent them! Ang galing, right?
It is fascinating that Filipino journalists remain silent and take all this sitting down — an American bubbling up from the ground and taking home (to America) what is purported to be the first Nobel “Peace Prize” of the Philippines. Is this “prize” really for Filipinos to behold? Take a careful look at Maria Ressa and what she really stands for and the answer to that question may not be as clear as her sponsors would like it to be for the rest of us.
Ressa may not have meant to say the following in irony but it would drip with it if read by anyone else…
I’ve said this repeatedly over the last five years: without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality, no democracy, and it becomes impossible to deal with the existential problems of our times: climate, coronavirus, now, the battle for truth.
Indeed, you can’t have trust. Ressa is spot on on that one. Recall a report published by the University of Oxford and the Reuters Institute last year that shows Rappler at the bottom of a ranking of the most trusted media brands in the Philippines.
It is likely because, as Ressa points out herself, there are no facts and, therefore, no truth in all the bad things she says about the Philippines and its government.",Others
Maria Ressa does not deserve the Philippine Senate “Medal of Excellence”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/maria-ressa-does-not-deserve-the-philippine-senate-medal-of-excellence/,"It has everything to do with President Rodrigo Duterte and it is an election year. Why would the Senate stoop so low as to bestow a medal of excellence on Maria Ressa when her work as a journalist is hardly excellent? Her English proficiency is because she’s an American citizen who attended Princeton. But other than this, her body of work does not approximate those who preceded her in what was then considered a noble profession.
There is nothing in her writing style that is compelling. What she is actually is a foreign agent, sponsored by both public and private American vested interest groups, who are out to install a leader in this country who is friendlier to them and subscribes to their ideology. What we have seen in the vilification of a national artist for literature by Ressa’s sycophants reflects the rot in our society at present. Principles and values are no longer the basis of sound judgment. It is more about being on the “right” side of “history” with authoritarian, fascist, tyrannical and dictartatorship, all being used out of context.
Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize is meant to shock and awe us monkeys who can be all agog over such an “honor” bestowed on someone who claims to be Filipino but is actually not. You wonder whatever happened to the sense of propriety of Senators who don’t even bother to show respect for the Filipinos who voted them into office. Ressa’s Nobel Prize is supposed to serve as the validation of her claims against the Duterte administration and trick the public into voting for the Opposition in the 2022 election. This is the only reason why she was selected. It is nothing but cheap propaganda that adds millions into Ressa’s pocket which is already brimming with funds from foreign sources.
If the Duterte administration was truly tyrannical, dictatorial and authoritarian, Rappler would be shut down by now. But it is still operating and spewing propaganda against the administration. It has failed to uphold the basic tenet of journalism which is to protect the public from government overreach and corruption. Maria Ressa pales in comparison to Max Soliven and Louie Beltran who didn’t spare the Yellowidiots any quarter the minute they were in power. Their reporting was based on facts and not their version of facts.
If the Senators pushing for Ressa to receive the Senate’s highest honor don’t come to their senses then it is only fitting that a campaign be waged against them with the public for them not to continue being members of what is supposed to be a collegial body of learned men who have experience and wisdom. The public perception of the Senate and Senators isn’t that high to begin with. It will only go lower if Maria Ressa is awarded an honor she doesn’t deserve.",Others

This time, the “news” is that she has been granted permission by the Philippines’ Court of Appeals (CA) to travel to the United States to “deliver a series of lectures at the Harvard Kennedy School in Boston.” Such is the importance of this “news” that, for good measure, a videographer accompanied her as she made her way through the airport to assure her Twitter fans that she did, indeed, make that flight.

Ressa is the “news” according to Rapplerette Lian Buan who filed the above story. However, the real news here is that the Philippines is not, as Ressa claims, the horrible “war zone” that is ruled by an “evil tyrant”. In late 2019, however, this is what Maria Ressa said about the Philippines:
The situation in Manila is far worse than any war zone that I’ve been in. In a war zone you know exactly where the threats are coming from. I plan my way in and we plan our way out and you’re there for a limited period of time. We’ve been living through three years of this kind of hell.
“This kind of hell,” Ressa said back then. One wonders if she will be able to repeat that appraisal of the situation in the Philippines when she speaks before her audience at the Harvard Kennedy School. What kind of “hell” of a country after all would allow due process to run its course even for a person its government has every reason to deny travel overseas? Buan herself writes of the consideration the CA applied to Ressa’s case in this instance; “the CA Eighth Division said the Harvard lectures were proven to be urgent and necessary.”
As to the Philippines being ruled by a “tyrant”? Buan “reports” how “[the] Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) tried to contest this travel grant, citing among others Ressa’s alleged flight risk, but the CA did not agree.” What tyrant would subject himself to the law as dispensed by an agency of the judiciary and defer to its ruling even if it runs counter to his attorney’s wishes? Last we heard, most tyrants simply shoot anyone who disagrees with them. Clearly there is none of that “tyranny” in the Philippines that Ressa talks about to anyone who cares to listen.
The fact is, Maria Ressa is a bag of lies. She gallivants all over the world making herself Nobel “Peace Prize” worthy at the expense of the Philippines, its people, and their government. One can only hope that this “Peace Prize” medal pinned to her sleeve makes her and her stories an even bigger target for long-overdue scrutiny.",Others
Team Bongbong Marcos – Sara Duterte wows MASSIVE Philippine Arena crowd in show anchored by ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/team-bongbong-marcos-sara-duterte-wows-massive-philippine-arena-crowd-in-show-anchored-by-abs-cbn-star-toni-gonzaga/,"Yesterday’s campaign kick-offs again made the writing on the wall even more evident with the clear topping of the shows of the day by administration candidates Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte who “rocked” a packed Philippine Arena. Even communist “journalist” Inday Espina Varona was moved to admit, “[in] terms of numbers, the son of Ferdinand Marcos and the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte won the campaign kickoff mobilisation game,  no ifs nor buts.”
In terms of production quality, scale of organisation, and overall pizzaz, the performance delivered by Team BBM-Duterte outclassed all the rest. As many in the audience observed, ABS-CBN star Toni Gonzaga was in her element as host of the event. Her booming voice could have filled the arena even without a mike.
To that, Rapplerette Lian Buan sourly points out, “Toni Gonzaga, one of ABS-CBN’s biggest celebrities, introduces Rodante Marcoleta who pushed to deny the franchise renewal of the network costing thousands of Kapamilya workers their jobs.” Buan, still likely butthurt from that “assault on press freedom”, seems to suggest that Gonzaga owes utang na loob (a debt of gratitude) to ABS-CBN. That’s just typical of kiddie “journalists” glossing over the real facts underlying the demise of the top Yellowtard media conglomerate just to push their preferred narrative.
Of course, a lame attempt to cut down the the host of the show is futile considering not just the star power that was on exhibit in the event but also the chemistry between the candidates. This was evident in the service vice presidential candidate Sara Duterte did herself in the clear and articulate speech she delivered to introduce herself and the grace she exhibited giving her running mate a rousing introduction.
Speaking of stars, third-generation Marcos star Sandro Marcos seemed to be making his dad proud demonstrating an ability to steal the show from the latter as the crowd roared when the big background screen briefly cut to him as he flashed the victory sign.
Indeed, it was a wild night — the culmination of steady consistent work over the last eight to twelve months to secure the numbers, form the best relationships and alliances, manage communications and messaging, and, overall, deliver an engaging and sticky brand to Filipino voters. Of course, this was a journey very-well documented by the more objective contributors to the national debate that the Opposition’s chi chi Katipunan-educated “thought leaders” like to pretend do not exist. As such, to really appreciate the remarkable nature of what was achieved by the administration camp would be to note what a respected member of the Opposition camp has to say himself (albeit a tad grudgingly) about even just the latter two to three months of that journey and what, by now, should be an outcome that no longer surprises…
Marcos’ refusal to slide down and Inday Sara eventually sliding down to number two coated him with a veneer of toughness and finally lent him the air of being a winner; it also gave both him and her (Marcos Jr. and Inday Sara, respectively) something they’d lacked thus far: the sense of being backed by a significant […] durable coalition featuring former president and speaker Arroyo (plus the Romualdezes). It was this drama, and the coalescing of the veteran politicians, that boosted Marcos’ presidential numbers, and made Sara the person to beat for the presidency. It sucked all the air out of the room, politically speaking, stalling the moderate momentum of Leni Robredo who’d kept the remnants of the opposition guessing, and absolutely depriving the other candidates, Moreno, Pacquiao, and Lacson, of what their candidacies needed, too: drama. The keep ’em guessing plus substitution gambit of 2016 succeeded in its 2021 rerun.
The point Inquirer columnist and former Undersecretary Manuel L Quezon III was leading to in making the above observation taken from his piece today “Now for the hard part” really had more to do with what he regards as the hard slog the Opposition is in for over the remaining weeks of their campaign.
This early, his campaign can claim the tantalizing possibility of the first majority presidency since (take your pick) either 1986 or 1969. But there remains hope of the others, currently in the teens or less, percentage-wise, to somehow convince the public to join them and thus start giving the Marcoses a run for their money.
Quezon’s statement of “hope” for the Opposition clearly doubles as a warning. It is a warning because the Opposition, specially the “leading” Yellowtard bloc within it rallying around presidential candidate Leni Robredo show no signs of reforming the negative messaging that characterises their campaign and which contributed to the running to the ground of their campaign. Even more important for the Opposition is that they reconsider the sorts of characters they habitually associate themselves with.
In the case of the Yellowtards’ chummy-chummy relations with the Philippines’ Catholic Church the officers of which are held to a vow of obedience to their overlords in Rome, displays like these — of nuns in ancient habits performing ancient rituals — raise questions around how serious Robredo’s camp are about upholding their supposedly progressive character. The standout example, in this instance, is their supposed championing of women’s issues and their supposed alignment with the “causes” of feminism and gay rights. The Roman Catholic Church, we might remind everyone, stands for everything that feminists and the gay community are against.
The big challenge in the coming weeks is mainly on the Opposition nuisance candidates. Will they continue competing amongst themselves for the Number Two position? Or will they be able to pull together the mettle, the creative chops, and the groundbreaking originality required to gun for Number One?

VERA Files DISHONESTLY flagged article on Leni Robredo’s disqualification in the 2016 elections as “false”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/vera-files-dishonestly-flagged-article-on-leni-robredos-disqualification-in-the-2016-elections-as-false/,"A VERA Files “report” falsely flagged as “false” the 2016 Get Real Post article “Leni Robredo disqualified from the VP post due to LP non-compliance to COMELEC policy!”.
The GRP article, pointed out how, in the 2016 elections “Robredo’s running mate and Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas as well as the Liberal Party itself failed to meet the deadline imposed by the Commission on Election (COMELEC) on the submission of the [Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs)].” Cited was Section 14 of Republic Act 7166 in effect at the time which stipulates the “Effect of Failure to File Statement”; to wit, “no person elected to any public offices shall enter upon the duties of his office until he has filed the statement of contributions and expenditures herein required.” Most notably…
The same prohibition shall apply if the political party which nominated the winning candidate fails to file the statement required herein within the period prescribed by this Act.
At the time the article was published on the 10th June 2016, the 8th June deadline imposed by the COMELEC to file the SOCE had just lapsed and, as such, it was safe to assert that Robredo was effectively disqualified from taking her position as presumptive “vice president”.
VERA Files asserts that GRP makes a “false claim” because “the Liberal Party in 2016 appealed to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to extend for another 14 days the deadline for filing of statement of contributions and expenditures (SOCE) for that year’s polls” and that “the LP was able to submit its SOCE for the elections several days before the extended deadline set by the election body. No disqualification took place and Robredo was sworn into office as the country’s 14th vice president on June 30, 2016.”
However, VERA Files dishonestly omits an important detail. Section 2 of Rule 10 issued by the COMELEC applicable for these 2016 elections states that there is absolutely no provision to allow an extension of the 8th of June deadline for filing the SOCE for any reason whatsoever…
The 08 June 2016 deadline shall be final and non-extendible. Submissions beyond this period shall not be accepted. COMELEC Resolutions Nos. 9849 and 9873, Minute Resolutions Nos. 13-0775 and 13-0823 are hereby repealed, insofar as they allowed the belated submission, amendmentand/or correction of campaign finance disclosure statements and reports and the imposition of late penalties for the 2013 National and Local Elections.
Taking the above into account, GRP at the time it published the article “Leni Robredo disqualified from the VP post due to LP non-compliance to COMELEC policy!” on the 10th June of 2016 made an accurate appraisal of the dire situation Robredo and the LP found themselves in at the time — that she and the rest of LP’s lineup of “winning” candidates in those elections faced outright disqualification for non-compliance to a non-negotiable COMELEC election rule applicable at the time.
In actual fact, it is VERA Files that makes a false claim in this instance. It is also worth noting that the head of VERA Files, Ellen Tordesillas, is a known supporter of the Liberal Party and rabidly loyal to one of its top attack dogs, former “senator” Antonio Trillanes. Therein lies the whole reason the idea of “certified fact checkers” is problematic. Conflicts of interest abound and raise an age-old question: Who fact checks the fact checkers?",Others
Yellowtards call it “fat shaming”. I call it being ashamed of the FACTS.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/yellowtards-call-it-fat-shaming-i-call-it-being-ashamed-of-the-facts/,"It’s good that my article “Yellowtards trying to cover up the FACT that Leni Robredo is now fat” generated a lot of healthy debate about the proverbial elephants (pardon the pun) in the room. The whole trouble with having a no-go-zone around which we need to tiptoe is that they don’t go away unless they are confronted. Left unaddressed, these slow down or even paralyse the more real conversations we need to be having about the politicians who have put themselves out there for Filipinos to scrutinise in the lead up to an important election. Worse, efforts to whitewash or, shall we say, pinkwash a gaping matter begging to be acknowledged only serves to highlight said matter even more.
First of all, it is a fact. Leni Robredo is fat. Did I say there is anything wrong with being fat? Perhaps not, but health experts do have something to say about excessive weight. That’s beside the point, however. The real points are the ones that the Yellowtards who rabidly defend Robredo consistently miss — those two points I cite above; i.e., (1) tiptoe around a no-go-zone in the discourse and that zone only gets bigger (pardon the pun again), and (2) cover it up and you end up with a dike springing holes here and there that you need to keep scrambling to plug. The inconvenient thing about facts is, well, they always emerge one way or another and ruin people’s plans to come across as all sugar and spice and everything nice.
So on to Fact Number Two. Bam Aquino was one of those who brought all this to light in a tweet where he exhibited a campaign meme that made use of what looks to be like a 2017-era photo of Leni Robredo all glammed up in a slim-fit dress and high-heeled shoes.
As Borat would say, izza-niiiccce, right? Maybe I’m reading too much into that meme and Mr. Aquino’s choice of photo for it. But one thing’s for sure, that choice was a conscious one. We may, of course, never know what really motivated that choice because Yellowtards see themselves as too uppity to respond to child-like questions such as mine, so that perhaps gives us some license to assume that he chose that photo because Robredo looked better at the time it was taken. That is, of course, fair enough. Who, after all, consciously posts unflattering photos of themselves when they want to win a presidential race, right?
Then again, I could be mistaken. Robredo seems to want to come across as being “one with the masa” (plebes) and goes to great lengths to craft that persona. We can see this in the way she is not above hamming it up with the likes of star vlogger Mimiyuuuh (a.k.a. Jeremy Sancebuche) — basically upholding a tradition of campaigning to the lowest common denominator by tapping into that easy space where a lack of a strategic vision for the nation is of no consequence.

Thing is, when you engage the public via a medium like TikTok where visuals trump intellectual payload, well, one necessarily opens one’s self to judgement on said visuals. After all, there isn’t much to evaluate beyond the visuals so, guess what, one’s appearance becomes fair game.
If Robredo wants to be taken seriously and be regarded for her ideas and vision rather than her hairdo, her choice of shoes, the colour of her threads, or, yes, her increasing girth then she needs to give the public something to work with. As far as we have seen, Robredo and her camp have given out nothing beyond loud colours to gawk at and big elephants in the room to awkwardly ignore. Act like a clown and you will be regarded as such. Talk about other people and you will be responded to with whataboutisms. Have an actual vision and a strategy to take Filipinos on a journey to achieve it and there will be less need, if at all, to engage shamelessly in the earlier two.",Others
Yellowtards expected a rumble but SMNI News delivered rare CONVERSATION and a chance for the better candidates to be heard,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/yellowtards-expected-a-rumble-but-smni-news-delivered-rare-conversation-and-a-chance-for-the-better-candidates-to-be-heard/,"The biggest losers in last night’s debate at Okada Manila organised by SMNI News were the top Opposition aspirants for Second Place — Leni Robredo, Isko Moreno, Manny Pacquiao, and Ping Lacson. They missed out on an event that drew eyeballs and opened the door to presidential candidates that had for so long been unceremoniously omitted by Big Corporate Media. It was a breath of fresh air for Filipino voters jaded and weary of the vacuous ululations of crybabies who do nothing but whine about “the Martial Law Years”, “trolls”, “fake news”, misogyny, attacks on “press freedom”, and not doing enough to “help the poor”. Cleared of all the noise of Yellowtardism and scare mongering over a “return to tyranny”, the event opened a space for conversation about the truly important issues that keep ordinary Filipinos awake at night.
Not surprisingly, Opposition partisans were disappointed. They were expecting communist presidential candidate Leodegario “Ka Leody” Quitain de Guzman to “tear Marcos apart” in what would have, if they had their way, been more of a bardagulan (rumble) among participants. Instead, the panel did a good job fielding the sorts of questions fit for presidential candidates and fielded them equally amongst the participating candidates which included De Guzman, administration candidate Bongbong Marcos, former national security adviser Norberto Gonzales, and former presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella. In essence, apart from Marcos who already enjoys a huge lead over the rest, as various surveys conducted by reputable polling firms suggest, all participants had lots to gain from this event and came out winners.
As for the expected grilling that Opposition Yellowtards and communists expected Marcos to cop, well, he did get it, but not from their “representative” of the moment on this occasion. Marcos — like all his fellow participants — was put through the wringer by the esteemed panelists which included, among others, University of the Philippines Professor Clarita Carlos, Manila Times chairman Dante Ang, former 5th District congressman and former vice governor Rolex Suplico, and SMNI journalist MJ Mondejar. The grillings the panel delivered equally across the four participants — credit to the moderation chops of host Karen Jimeno — effectively extinguishes accusations of “bias” thrown by Opposition “thought leaders” at SMNI News and the panelists of this event. Indeed, one can easily glean the dishonest intent in the mission Ka Leody was expected by his Opposition cheerleaders to accomplish last night in the sorts of commentary fielded on Twitter.
Evidently, the Yellowtards and commies would have preferred a chaotic free-for-all instead of the discussion among gentlemen that was on exhibit last night. This likely reflects on the candidates who skipped this occasion and ended up looking like cowardly chumps. That their supporters would egg Ka Leody to behave like a buffoon and run roughshod over the forum rules of the event just to be able to take a swing at one of the participants speaks lots about the character of the bloc of the Opposition represented by Robredo, Moreno, Pacquiao, and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Lacson.
To be fair, Ka Leody acted like a gentleman that night — perhaps because he was in the company of the same. He did so even when the hairy topic of communist terrorism was raised. Nonetheless, he was clearly out of his depth in the company of his fellow participants. Whereas the others were able to explore the topic from a broad perspective, Ka Leody only had his extremist ideology to work with. The manner with which he justified armed rebellion and terrorism only highlighted the elephant in the room that traditional Big Corporate Media routinely tiptoes around with regard to a communist presidential candidate — the reality that a guy like Ka Leody or any communist-backed candidate for that matter will likely not have really thought through what it means to be President of the Philippines and the commander-in-chief of its military forces. To which army will Ka Leody owe his loyalties to? The terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) the armed “revolution” of which he evidently supports? How exactly can he fulfil his presidential role if he is a supporter of armed rebellion?
Of course the communist camp are not lacking a bench full of university kiddies supporting the lie that is the “people’s revolution” they insist is being waged by the NPA in the hinterlands. This sentiment is captured by Ateneo-trained “sociologist”, “outstanding scientist”, and Rappler “journalist” Jayeel Cornelio who is quick to defend Ka Leody’s pony show last night.
Indeed, one subtle thing achieved by this SMNI event is that it gave Filipinos the opportunity to see first-hand these elections’ communist candidate letting rip his views on what a communist regime really intends for the Philippines. Ka Leody had no specifics to offer on what his foreign affairs architecture might look like. For that matter he had no specifics on just about everything a president needs to wrap his head around and get on top of as the Philippines’ chief executive over the next six years. There was nothing Ka Leody could articulate that falls outside the narrow script that his crooked ideology allows him to draw from. As such, Ka Leody is no different to that group of pals he had been conscripted to “represent” last night — merely pretending to be “inclusive” but only within the terms of his obsolete communist orthodoxy.
The Opposition were loudly hoping that this debate would turn around their fortunes either (1) because Marcos would be left looking like a chump in an empty debate hall after their presumptuous “boycott” or (2) because their proxy Ka Leody would rip him a second one in what they thought would be an entertaining cockfight. None of those things happened last night and the Opposition were left looking even more like what this campaign have revealed their lot to be — pathetic puppets working off hollow rhetoric, keyboard brawlers lacking in grace and class, and a dishonest political force whose members harbour a perverted sense of entitlement to political power on the basis of their belief that they are the “good guys” in a battle between “good” and “evil” that is being fought only within the made-up world spun by their retarded imagination.",Others
"Traditional “journalists”, suck it up: You no longer hold a monopoly over mass communication.",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/traditional-journalists-suck-it-up-you-no-longer-hold-a-monopoly-over-mass-communication/,"One can quite understand why traditional “journalists” are going all shrill about the prospect of having to compete with bloggers for the privilege to reach a mass audience. After all, they once enjoyed a monopoly over that space. Before the advent of the Internet and, particularly, social media, mass communication was a capital-intensive activity. You needed to own a powerful transmitter or a printing press, maintain a distribution network (specifically for the latter), and possess the wherewithal to navigate the myriad of government regulations to operate. The barriers for entry into that space were formidable not just for the capitalists who invested in these assets. “Journalists” too had to have the credentials to practice their craft and be considered for employment in these traditional radio broadcast and print media organisations. They had to be university graduates, and had to go through the whole job application process to work for a media company carve out a niche for themselves in the market for mass media content.
Imagine then the chagrin felt by today’s “journalism” establishment. Their top “thought leaders” are huffing and puffing at the thought of competing with people who got into their space using just a laptop or a phone with Internet access and a social media or blogging platform account. One can therefore understand why they are so  obsessed in pointing out why bloggers are not “journalists” and, if they want to be a part of the space “journalists” occupy, what measures they need to be subject to (e.g. “standards”, “accreditation”, sworn faith to a so-called “code of ethics”, etc.) to gain entry into said space. The psychology behind this is that traditional “journalists” be like; I jumped through all these hoops to be able to address a mass audience, therefore bloggers should too. Well, guess what: Just because you say so does not necessarily mean it will be so.
Traditional “journalists” are a bunch of dinosaurs. This they proved this year when, despite ganging up on President Rodrigo Duterte and soon-to-be President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the latter still won this year’s elections by a massive landslide while the earlier sustained an impressive public approval rating right up to the very end. Landslide na nga, massive pa. That’s the scale at which Filipinos voted in these elections to revoke their trust in these ancient “mainstream” reptiles. The influence on public opinion they pat themselves on the back with to assure themselves of their continued relevance in society was proven to be a dud. Evidently it was the onslaught of alternatives Filipinos could tap for information that gave the Establishment a run for their money. So now their approach given that these alternatives — bloggers and social media influencers running circles around them — are here to stay, what do these “journalists” do? Well, like they do to anything else that does not fit their peachy view of how the world ought to to work, they make them the “evil” guys in that all-too-familiar narrative of a battle between “good” and “evil”. As expected, they are only too quick to cast themselves as the “good guys” in that narrative. Sounds really all-too-familiar a modus operandi, doesn’t it? Today, bloggers are “purveyors of disinformation” while they, on the other hand, are the “truth seekers”. Them versus us. Very familiar indeed.
So Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin Jr (who had himself been a media publisher and executive in various roles in the past) was spot-on in summing up the lament of his ilk…
“Press freedom on social media does not involve the steep price of printing or broadcast, editors and reporters on regular pay and is cost-free self-indulgence with one hand—masturbation,” the official said.
The media Old Guard hinge their entitlement to an exclusive pedestal above the free market of ideas primarily on the basis of an edifice of credentials resting on an infrastructure of pompous tradition that is protected by, in Locsin’s own words, “the steep price of printing or broadcast”. Like most forms of market protectionism, this has become all but unsustainable as Locsin and his compadres are finding out the hard way. The irony that flies way above their pointed heads is that market forces are king. Despite the Nazistic manner with which old-school “journalists” like Locsin protected their lofty place, market forces eventually caught up with them. These elections showed them the stark scorecard — proof that no amount of credentialism can prop up credibility when your time of reckoning has come. The best thing that MSM media can do is compete on that level playing field and prove their value in that free market that they keep denying exists. Credibility cannot be bought nor legislated.",Others
"Reports that more than 40,000 participants attended Yellowtard rallies in Cavite and Bulacan are all LIES",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/reports-that-more-than-40000-participants-attended-yellowtard-rallies-in-cavite-and-bulacan-are-all-lies/,"Last week saw a spate of rallies conducted by the leading Yellowtard bloc of the Philippine Opposition headed by “vice president” Leni Robredo. One which was held in Cavite boasted “47,000” participants. Another held in Bulacan Saturday boasted “45,000”. The source of both numbers was very likely the organisers themselves and, as expected, this “information” was amplified by dishonest “journalists” like Mara Cepeda of Opposition “social news network” Rappler.
WATCH: Some 45,000 Kakampinks attend the grand rally of presidential candidate VP Leni Robredo and her running mate Sen Kiko Pangilinan in Malolos, Bulacan.
Will tens of thousands of attendees become the new staple at Leni-Kiko rallies?
🎥 Team Kiko Pangilinan @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/52JIZEDtpE
— Mara Cepeda (@maracepeda) March 5, 2022
A photo featured in the Manila Bulletin “report” titled “The battle is on: 45,000 supporters pack Robredo’s grand rally in Bulacan” included the caption, “Bulacan sits in the same table with Iloilo and Cavite, as Malolos City welcomed Vice President Leni Robredo and her running mate Kiko Pangilinan with a whooping [sic] 45,000 pink-clad supporters during their campaign rally on Saturday, March 5. (Photo courtesy of Del Laddaran)”. Where the 45,000 estimate came from, as mentioned earlier, remains a mystery and it is evident neither Cepeda nor Raymund Antonio who authored the Bulletin “report” could be bothered to find an alternative source to corrobrate what they were told.
An easy approach would have been to at least use the photo included in the Bulletin “report” — or, for that matter, others shared on social media — as basis to do some quick independent estimates. The Bulletin photo shows some indication of where the edges of the crowd lie and, from that, give one an idea of the ground area within the Malolos Sports and Convention Center it occupied at the time the photo was taken.
From such a simple analysis alone, it would have been easy to see that the notion of a “45,000-strong crowd” at the Bulacan rally being bandied around by both the Yellowtards and their lackeys in Big Corporate Media is not plausible at all. [NB: the analysis approach that follows is credited to Twitter user “Sysiaco” who demonstrated it in a tweet] Even if the entire complex grounds were filled to a density of three people per square metre, these grounds could have hosted only 36,900 people. And on the basis of the projected ground area taken up by the crowd in Antonio’s Bulletin report, there could have only been 18,000 people in the event at most.
That the Yellowtards would routinely conspire with Big Corporate Media to spread misleading information about the size of their rallies — as in this instance — gives ample cause to doubt every bit of “information” they release on the outcomes of their rallies and campaign sorties. It is also further proof of the atrocious quality of “journalism” Filipinos are being subject to by what are supposed to be the largest and most prominent news organisations in the country.",Others
"Mass media exist to serve Filipinos, not indulge their fantasy entitlement to “press freedom”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/mass-media-exist-to-serve-filipinos-not-indulge-their-fantasy-entitlement-to-press-freedom/,"Now that the worst Yellowtard nightmare has transpired — the ascent to power of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. — mass media “activists” are on edge. They now engage in preemptive fear mongering that the Marcos administration will be coming down hard on the industry which, you guessed it, heralds the start of their much-anticipated “attack on press freedom” (or so we keep getting told). Well perhaps it is high time that the media be attacked — specifically taking them to task for a blanket immunity from prosecution for inappropriate, even criminal, behaviour that they had granted themselves over the last three and a half decades and now rabidly defend.
Just like Filipinos have come to realise that “freedom” is not the be-all-end-all that guarantees them prosperity, it has also come to light recently that a “free press” delivers nothing much as far as anything really relevant to the average Filipino goes. That the Yellowtard and communist camps that have all but appointed themselves the “guardians” of “press freedom” of the land find themselves today utterly buried by Marcos’s and his running mate Sara Duterte’s landslide electoral wins proves this. Despite the non-renewal of the franchise to broadcast of ABS-CBN happening under former president Rodrigo Duterte’s watch, Duterte sustained his public trust and approval ratings. Duterte went on to cap his term with the National Telecommunications Commission’s (NTC’s) blocking of Internet access to communist media channels Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revoking of the articles of incorporation of “social news network” Rappler. Not much of an activist “movement” erupted following those either. All we got was a pathetic whimper from the discredited “thought leaders” of the Philippines’ “journalism” establishment.
It seems that, for many Filipinos today, “journalism” of the sort Yellowtards and communists “fight” and “hold the line” for is a hollow notion propped up by partisans with dishonest intents. Stories that make top headlines in mainstream news outlets don’t reflect what truly matter to ordinary Filipinos and, instead, are motivated primarily by partisan agendas. Small surprise that none of what constitutes the “plight” of embattled media organisations like Rappler, Bulatlat, and Pinoy Weekly today resonates with the broader public. They’ve essentially made themselves irrelevant on account of the stories they choose to prioritise in aid of their dishonest agendas.
A fine balance needs to be struck between allowing mass media outlets reasonable freedom to contribute to a healthy public discourse and holding them accountable for noise and degenerate content they deliver to our screens. This may require publicly funded mass media networks that are mandated to produce and air content that is of true service to the public unencumbered by the financial and political goals of privately-held for-profit media organisations. The national interests need to be upheld and necessarily weigh larger than the interests of private enterprise. The idea that “press freedom” trumps all that, as we are lead to believe by its cheerleaders such as Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa, should be given serious reevaluation.
The late former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once spoke about the divisiveness of Philippine media in a speech given during the annual convention of American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1998. According to Lee, “a wieldy partisan press helped Filipino politicians to flood the market place of ideas with junk”. Lee was referring to how the Philippine press before Martial Law enjoyed unrestrained freedom but failed the Filipino people. Lee added that the Philippine press “confused and befuddled the Filipino people so they could not see what their vital interests were in a developing country. And because basic issues like economic growth and equitable distribution was seldom discussed and were not tackled, the democratic system malfunctioned.”
Now that the government is headed by leaders who are not kept on a tight leash by oligarchs who own big media organisations, a rare opportunity has been opened to reform the anarchy that is today’s mass media landscape. Filipinos can thank outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte for getting the ball rolling. Under the watch of President Marcos Filipinos can now look forward to a regime that can truly keep mass media honest. As to fears that government could be in a position to abuse this power, there is, of course, social media where a true free market of ideas ensures that everyone is kept honest. No one organisation or camp can presume to be the final authority on what is the truth and what “facts” need to be “checked”.",Others
Communist publications @PinoyWeekly and @Bulatlat BANNED; discredited Opposition “journalists” scramble to their defense,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/communist-publications-pinoyweekly-and-bulatlat-banned-discredited-opposition-journalists-scramble-to-their-defense/,"Following an order issued by the Philippines’ National Security Council to block Internet access to “news sites allegedly linked to communist rebels”, various media groups and “journalists” associated with the Philippine Opposition and its communist allies are up in arms again invoking that all-too-familiar “attack on press freedom” trope. The cast of characters in this shrill outcry consist, of course, of the usual suspects…
The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) denounced the “arbitrary inclusion” of Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, and other independent news sites in a list of those tagged as being “affiliated to and are supporting” the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF).
The defense is rabid and dishonest, going to the extent of issuing blatant lies as Roby Alampay, “Founder, Chairman and Editor-at-Large of PumaPodcast” does in this tweet.
There is, contrary to Alampay’s assertion, ample evidence of links of these groups not just to the Communist Party of the Philippines but, more disturbingly, to its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army. We cited these links some time back in our article “Make no mistake. ‘Pinoy Weekly’ is a COMMUNIST publication!”. Evidence is in the public domain as both Altermidya and Pinoy Weekly exhibited no reservations taking credit for seemingly exclusive photos of armed NPA personnel…
Interestingly, this “legitimate” news organisation seems to have ready access to the Communist Party of the Philippines’ (CPP) terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.
Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya.
Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows.
It is no wonder these “journalists” have been utterly discredited. They continue to insult Filipinos with their blatant lies and their presumption to unilaterally crown themselves the foremost “guardians of truth” of the land. Filipinos need to rid their politics of these vermin. What are noble causes and important advocacies are corrupted by dishonest “thought leaders” who use issues of national consequence to disguise an insidious mission to destroy democracy through violent “revolution”. Perhaps they may seem not as threatening as they once were — their “fighters” are more snowflake than guerrilla in appearance and their weapons more Apple than AK-47. If for anything, Filipinos should at least get rid of them because they insult Philippine democracy by suggesting that, despite the hard work of people who work within the legal frame, it is hopelessly broken. Philippine democracy is anything but broken. This is a fact that can be further re-enforced once Filipinos put their collective feet down and take back real activism from the communists and their “woke” Yellowtard allies.
“Media practitioners” who belong to leftist-militant media organizations such as Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, and Altermidya are included in the order of battle of the state because they incite sedition. The dishonest perception they aim to spin is that there is suppression of freedom of the press in the country when, in truth, there is none. The fact is, many take for granted the idea that these organisations are “news media” channels when, in reality, they are anything but. They are, when it comes down to it, no more than mere propaganda arms of an obsolete Cold War era “movement” that counts as its singular aim the overthrow through violent “revolution” any legitimately-elected Philippine government.

"Sure, ban K-dramas. While we’re at it, let’s ban Filipino teleseryes too!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/sure-ban-k-dramas-while-were-at-it-lets-ban-filipino-teleseryes-too/,"Just ban them all. To what end do these idiotic programmes serve Filipinos aspirations to become a great people someday? Will these contribute to transforming the Philippines from a Third to a First World country over the next two to three decades? The argument around whether the Philippines’ entertainment industry needs more — or less — competition misses the point entirely. What it really comes down to is whether Filipinos need these sorts of content pumped into their screens and living rooms to begin with.
Step back and consider for a moment. As things are, Filipinos already face monumental challenges becoming the sorts of intellectually- and culturally-rich people that are important pillars for a truly progressive, prosperous, and strong society. What are the roadblocks to staying on the road to that end and keeping an eye on the ball? The latter part of the question — keeping an eye on the ball — highlights an important virtue of successful people: focus. The last thing Filipinos need are distractions. It is from this perspective that we should evaluate the place non-value-adding content like dramas (whether Korean, Mexican, American, or Filipino) enjoy in Philippine society given these important challenges. Already, Filipinos are beset by a crisis of attention — illiterate Grade 6 students, a political debate made up of players who fail in basic comprehension, and “bloggers” who are now incapable of writing — and reading — long form.
Worse, one can now observe laughable mudslinging between political factions even within that of the administrative camp (not to mention the even lamer debates between Yellowtards and communists that characterised their ill-fated campaign in the lead up to this year’s elections). This addiction to idiotic drama (to the extent that drama characterises relationships even among comrades) may very well be a result of the current widespread obsession with TV dramas. Rather than entertainment mirroring society, it seems it is society that is mirroring entertainment in the Philippines. Seen in this light, it can be said that television dramas (of the lame sort Filipinos are addicted to) are a serious social cancer in developing countries like the Philippines. Their effects on Philippine society are eroding the foundations (whatever such foundations exist to begin with) that would have underpinned the smart society that is essential to compete in today’s world order.
There really has never been any shortage of programming that gave producers of local media content a run for their money. Foreign media have been in the Philippines like forever. First it was Amercian TV and movies, then it was Japanese anime, now it is Korean entertainment. Through all those waves of competition, the quality of locally-produced entertainment has hardly changed. We still see the same lame premises, the same lame plots, the same lame characters, and the same intellectually-bankrupt fare being churned out by these content mills. And, guess what: the domestic market for this crap is pretty robust. Filipinos happily consume all that crap. Meanwhile vast oligarch-owned conglomerates like ABS-CBN laugh all the way to the bank year in and year out on the back of their dishonest business models. You’d be smiling too if you are able to sell 10-cent products for a hundred pesos to 100 million fools, wouldn’t you?
The point here is that Filipinos need to get their priorities right. Their political “representatives”, their “activists”, and their “journalists” routinely apply a lot of scrutiny on any sitting government supposedly evaluating whether their officials are on the ball moving the country in the right direction. To ensure consistency with that lofty goal, these cohorts need to routinely reflect on whether the “issues” they raise as fodder for their legislative agendas, their “activism”, and their “reports” are actually relevant or, at the very least, contribute to strategic development objectives. The fact is, Filipinos need to become a smart people in order to become better at building a prosperous nation. K-dramas versus Filipino teleseryes? That notion is a non-issue.",Others
Why is Leni Robredo still in the news? Because the Philippine Opposition can’t attract REAL political talent.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/why-is-leni-robredo-still-in-the-news-because-the-philippine-opposition-cant-attract-real-political-talent/,"Opposition “thought leaders” decry what they perceive to be a continued haranguing of “former vice president” Leni Robredo. Robredo, we recall “led” the Philippine Opposition to a crushing defeat in the 2022 presidential elections — an election that the Opposition deemed too important to lose. In actual practice, they did not seem to have considered it important enough to unite under a single banner to go up against what was clearly a formidable opponent. Worse, they chose Leni Robredo to be their “leader” — effectively creating a clique of wokes, associating themselves with a social elite, and effectively alienating the rest of the electorate.

Granted, Big Corporate Philippine Media is under pressure from their shareholders to bring in the clicks, eyeballs, and engagement (to further attract those clicks and eyeballs). Lowest-common-denominator wisdom dictates that a character that was buried in a national election that catapulted now-president Bongbong Marcos to power by the first ever majority vote since that 1986 “revolution” shouldn’t be the subject of content required to fulfill that business imperative. To be fair, however, we can’t really dismiss the chops of ABS-CBN’s big corporate data analytics team. Data analytics, after all, often reveals counterintuitive truths; for example, proving to people afraid of flying that crossing a street is far more dangerous than getting on a 22-hour trans-Pacific flight full of non-mask-wearing passengers.
The fact is, Robredo does attract the clicks and eyeballs but not because she is well-liked. Robredo is, to put it simply, a nice social media pastime. This is why having Leni as the subject of a social media post or piece of media content gets those thousands of “retweets”, “likes”, and reshares. This is also why, a cohort like the Yellowtards (who “led” the Opposition to oblivion over three consecutive national elections) who measure messaging success based on numbers of likes, retweets, and shares had misled themselves catastrophically so many times (and continue to do so today). Social media stats don’t necessarily spell success. They only provide insight on what keeps people entertained.
More importantly, this highlights the profound dishonesty of mainstream media “journalism”. Corporate media is, at its most fundamental, in the business of entertaining people. What was once a “public service” — news reporting — was once regarded as mere overhead. Good business strategy involves either managing overhead or finding ways to harvest economic value off costly activities that can’t be gotten rid of. Television “news reporting” evolved (or, rather, devolved) very likely as a result of that management imperative — transformed from a sober public service to a bells-and-whistles entertainment product that delivers nagbabagang balita! (emphasis on the exclamation mark).
Coming close to a year after the Marcos-Duterte tandem utterly buried the Opposition, it seems kinda sad that Robredo — loser embodied — continues to be seen as the face of the Opposition. That a country of more than 110 million cannot produce even one Opposition leader to replace this loser says a lot about the pool of talent in its society. If not to win the next national election, the Opposition should at least prove that the Philippines’ got talent. If Filipinos can’t create global P- or F-pop phenomena, can’t replace decrepit jeepneys with modern public transport, or even invent longer-lasting light bulbs (despite the legend that a Filipino “invented” fluorescent lighting), at least show that somebody with potential to be a better opposition leader than Leni Robredo is slogging through her math textbooks at the Ateneo — or scrounging around for pagpag somewhere within those steaming squatter colonies while dreaming of becoming the next President of the Philippines.",Others

“In its latest project, the NBA takes a deep dive into the country’s love affair with the sport of basketball.”
Luisa Morales – Philstar.com
February 19, 2023 | 5:28pm
The usual suspects trying to capitalize on the pinoy’s natural thirst to be in the NBA. A thirst that has yet to be quenched by any Filipino native. The NBA is a basketball league that has the best players in the world which they cram into 30 teams. That league makes money charging admission to the games involving NBA teams , selling the broadcast rights and selling the merchandise.
I have no idea how Philstar extends the production of basketball podcasts with employees from ESPN, GQ, Foxsports, Spin PH and equate that to “The NBA”. Yes, they cover the NBA but just because Philstar does a review of Antman does not make Philstar Disney and / or Marvel. The NBA logo is on the Hoops Paradise podcast and is promoted on the NBA website. The problem is the hosts of those podcasts (CJ Toledano, Cassidy Hubbarth, Sarah Kustok,Nikko Ramos and Alex Wong ) are employed by the media outlets I mentioned above. If they all don’t work for the NBA directly then how is the NBA doing a deep dive?  They devoted their best people to it even if they aren’t their people?  The NBA has bigger fish to fry. A lot of media cover the NBA using podcasts without being the NBA. Usual KSP ploy of grasping at straws by looking at the slimmest connection and then exaggerating it. Didn’t I just define a misnomer?
The podcast brags about people they perceive as ” Filipino American”. Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was born in Illinois. He played high school and college basketball in Oregon. Neither US state is in the Philippines the last time I looked. He did visit the Philippines several times and hosted basketball camps because of his connection to the Miami Heat. The Heat website talks about members of his family that carved out a career in sports and no pinoy sports are mentioned.
Someone else that is supposed to give the people insight on how the Philippines is a Hoops Paradise is Houston Rocket Jalen Green. Again , he was born in California and played all his high school basketball there. He went straight to the G- League after high school. He is only 21 years old. I have no idea if there is a better researcher than can show how both Green & Spoelstra can cite the Philippines as a reason for their success or how they can explain “Hoops Paradise”.
The world never cared about pinoy basketball. I doubt this podcast will change anything. Download numbers mean nothing since we all know Filipinos love to stuff the ballot box when it comes to international voting. All that matters is the number of people who download who are actual customers of the sponsors.  Statistics show that if you are born in the Philippines or played high school and/ or college basketball in the Philippines you will not make the NBA. Only pinoys care about pinoy basketball and the NBA is the only league that pinoys give two flying sheets about that is not pinoy. This pinoy devotion to the game with the orange ball may be cute to pinoys but that is the best it can be. That tunnel vision does not translate to either NBA players or even wins in the international stage.
“To determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is it that I am not permitted to criticize?”
Kevin Alfred Strom.
When you read the article from Philstar, they want you to believe the world and the NBA worship how Filipinos love the NBA. The NBA as a league does not worship the Philippines. However they worship China as I detailed in this piece written back in 2020.  LeBron James , Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich proved that China ruled them by denying any wrong doing by the Chinese government. The funny thing about Kevin Alfred Strom , the Associated Press said he is an American white nationalist and Holocaust denier.
Pinoys obsess over basketball and no other sport comes close. No Filipino men have ever won an Olympic gold medal in any sport. Filipinos are invisible in other high profile team sports where many other nations including Asian nations thrive mainly because basketball gets all the funding and attention .They have nobody from here playing in the NBA. They have not even qualified for the Olympics in half a century. They consider it a badge of honor to be recruited by a league that has been only opened it doors seven years ago.  The PBA is unknown to international basketball audiences. Anytime the Philippines is involved in FIBA,  the announcers exaggerate their value despite the lack of wins.  The devotion is there, the lack of tangible results abroad are not.

Liberal Party exec and former Congressman Teddy Baguilat caught spreading fake news about Rep. Sandro Marcos!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/liberal-party-exec-and-former-congressman-teddy-baguilat-caught-spreading-fake-news-about-rep-sandro-marcos/,"The Philippine Opposition like fancying themselves champions of some sort of “war” against “disinformation”. Indeed, their foremost “thought leaders” are convinced that the catastrophic loss they suffered in this year’s national elections in which current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr won by a massive landslide is an outcome of a sinister “disinformation” campaign against their hapless leader Leni Robredo.
Thus it is quite interesting to behold no less than former Congressman Teddy Baguilat, vice president for internal affairs of the Liberal Party, caught red-handed spreading “fake news”. In a tweet he has since deleted, Baguilat shared on Twitter an obviously fake quote card that featured House Representative Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Araneta Marcos III (1st District Ilocos Norte) stating…
Why the big fuss about the prices of red onions? Common sense dictates that you use white onions when red onions are expensive and alternatively, you should use red onions when white onions are expensive. Simple problems need simple solutions.
…to which Baguilat sneers in Tagalog, “In short, ang gusto nila sabihin, mag tiis kayo. Pag ganyan ang problem-solving skills ng leaders natin, kawawa tayo. Sana solusyonan kung bakit nahihirapan ang farmers kya nagmahal…” (translated to English: “what they want to say is, suck it up. When our leaders’ problem solving skills are such, poor us. Why not just find a solution to address farmers’ hardships that result in higher prices”).
The fake quote card bears the markings of Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI), evidence that there may, indeed, be a disinformation campaign being perpetrated by the Opposition camp.
The network has since issued a statement condemning this act of sabotage…
NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC:
SMNI News strongly condemns unauthorized and malicious use of its logo in fake news items pic.twitter.com/QAisNLub1k

Rep. Marcos also responded to Baguilat’s deleted tweet pointing out the error in the former Congressman’s ways.
This was not before eminent Opposition “journalists” Boo Chanco of The Philippine Star and Inday Espina Varona of Rappler had, themselves, contributed to the spread of this fakery. Fortunately for them, they had managed to delete their tweets before any further fallout and narrowly escaped Baguilat’s fate.
One would think seasoned “journalists” like Chanco and Varona would know better, right? Note, however, that Chanco was not above making a snide remark about Rep. Marcos inadvertently revealing the root cause of his own foolish lapse in judgement. We see the same mindset in a half-assed apology issued by Baguilat on Twitter following his inexcusable gaffe…
Nowhere in Baguilat’s apology tweet does he mention (i.e. add a “@sandromarcos7” to the tweet) Rep. Marcos. It’s typical of Yellowtard character — a lack of spine to, at least, directly address whoever they speak of. Baguilat’s intent was evidently to give the impression that he is apologising more to his followers while treating Marcos as a mere footnote in his “apology”.
Such class acts indeed. It is one thing that they noisily beat the war drum against “disinformation” and appoint themselves God’s “Truth Tellers”. Yellowtard “journalists” like Baguilat (he was once one) as well as Boo Chanco and Inday Espina Varona have so far yet to prove that they walk their talk. Until then, hypocrisy pa more, ladies.",Others
"With just a week to go, Yellowtards get a crash course in GOOD MANNERS from starlet Bianca Gonzalez",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/with-just-a-week-to-go-yellowtards-get-a-crash-course-in-good-manners-from-starlet-bianca-gonzalez/,"The desperate Yellowtard house-to-house campaign launched by Tricia Robredo, daughter of Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo soldiers on. With just a week to go before the official campaign period of these elections closes this weekend, the Yellowtards are willing to try anything.
They may be in luck this week. Esteemed Pinoy Big Brother alumna Bianca Gonzalez had recently stepped up to a particularly tough task — teach Yellowtard partisans basic good manners and social graces. In a series of tweets she issued today, Gonzalez lays out a short course in character development for her Opposition colleagues…
Gonzalez basically lays out a manifesto on how her Yellowtard pals can more effectively engage with Filipino voters (which she repreatedly refers to as “they”) to further their agenda of converting them to the Yellow “cause”.
What Gonzalez attempts to impart on her flock is stuff most normal people would have likely learned in kindergarten. Engaging with people effectively requires empathy and self-awareness. The core dysfunction that led the Yellowtards to the desperate situation they find themselves in today has to do with an abject lack of both these basic human virtues in the character of their campaign. Rather than invest the time to really understand where ordinary Filipinos are coming from, the Yellowtards, instead, ran a campaign that involved shoving high-horsed notions such as “human rights”, “gender equality”, “feminism”, and “press freedom” down people’s throats. Worse, they felt an entitlement to the absolute ascendancy of their “cause” on the imagined basis of their lot being the “good guys” in their manufactured narrative of these elections being a battle between “good” and “evil”.
To be fair, Gonzalez has the job cut out for her. She’s a revered celebrity and commands an enormous following on social media. If there is anyone Yellowtardom’s starstruck partisans will tingala to, it would be a starlet like Gonzalez. With just several days of campaign to go, the challenge ahead is a daunting one. Fortunately for the Yellowtards, their belief that they are “good” and all the rest of them are “evil” is keeping them motivated to campaign harder.",Others
Why Rappler should be BANNED from covering Malacañang,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/why-rappler-should-be-banned-from-covering-malacanang/,"President-elect Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. ran under a “unity” platform and it seems he is making good on this. He is now putting together a diverse team to help run the new Philippine Government and has even included a strong economic team with a good number of noted and highly-qualified technocrats. This is contrary to Chief Yellowtard “Economist” and Rapplerette JC Punongbayan crowing some time back that he expects the Marcos administration to experience huge challenges cobbling together an economic team because “at least 273 of the country’s leading economists backed [“vice president” Leni Robredo’s] campaign”.
Punongbayan has evidently eaten his words (or, in this case, his tweet) since then. The Inquirer today reports “Business groups nod as Marcos forms economic team” noting that Felipe Medalla, former dean of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Economics (Punongbayan’s supposed alma mater), has been nominated Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) governor.
Local business groups on Thursday welcomed the economic team taking shape.
“They are all seasoned and competent economic leaders. We believe they would do good in managing our fiscal affairs,” said George Barcelon, head of the country’s biggest business group Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Barcelon said such leaders were needed as the Philippines faced critical issues, such as the huge debt, budget deficit and the need for postpandemic reforms and programs to sustain recovery, among others.
Punongbayan’s hastily-taken position on the matter of Marcos’s economic team illustrates the whole trouble with his employer, “social news network” Rappler to which he contributes his “expertise” on matters of national economics. Rappler has long made no secret of its mission to be an agent for the undermining of any administration that is not friendly to its preferred partisan camp — specifically the Yellowtards under the banner of which failed presidential candidate Leni Robredo ran her ill-fated campaign.
In short, Rappler cannot be trusted to cover the administration of President Marcos with an objective lens. Its “news” team and panel of so-called “thought leaders” habitually backward-engineer “stories” from the party playbook and will likely keep their audience gaslit on the idea that Marcos is out to perpetrate “evil” over the coming six years of his presidential term. Given the challenges Filipinos face, a media organisation that has been found to be harbouring — and possibly concealing — links to foreign funding and influence is best kept out of the loop on government matters of national consequence.
There are also many other large, well capitalised, and highly-experienced media organisations in the country that employ mature and seasoned professionals. Rappler, on the other hand, is of questionable fiscal soundness and, worse, is staffed primarily by sophomoric amateurs who bob like little corks on a roiling sea of often misleading politically-motivated sentiment. It is thus not surprising that Rappler is, according to a Reuters-Oxford report, among the least-trusted news media organisations in the Philippines.
Indeed, it is a no-brainer. Why even bother with Rappler when it is essentially an inconsequential parasitical media organisation of questionable value to the public interest? There are limits to inclusivity specially when one considers an organisation with possible foreign ties, is headed by a US citizen, and that holds an extensive track record of propagating divisive — often seditious — messages. Rappler is free to compete for attention in the free market of ideas. Nobody is denying them that “right”. However, it and its dishonest “reporters” are not entitled to privileged access to Malacañang which is now headed by a person they had, for many years now, viciously demonised at every turn.",Others
"If Professor Clarita Carlos is a “pet analyst”, then JC Punongbayan is a quack “economist”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/if-professor-clarita-carlos-is-a-pet-analyst-then-jc-punongbayan-is-a-quack-economist/,"Rappler kiddie “reporter” Lian Buan should be careful what she calls esteemed University of the Philippines Professor Clarita Carlos. A “report” she authored published on the disgraced “social news network” was headlined “UP political science department distances from Marcos pet analyst” effectively denigrating the qualifications of this veteran academic with no apparent bases. Buan uncritically “reports”…
The University of the Philippines (UP) Department of Political Science issued a public notice on Saturday, May 21, distancing itself from – perhaps even short of disowning – retired professor Clarita Carlos, who has been the pet analyst of the supporters of presumptive president Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.
What does Buan argue to substantiate her assertion that Carlos is a “pet analyst” of Marcos’s supporters? Well, she writes, “Carlos has been criticized for past remarks whitewashing the atrocities of Ferdinand Marcos’ Martial Law.” Who were her critics and what specific “whitewashing” do they refer to? Don’t look at Buan because she provides answers to neither in her “report”. All Buan provides is a small sample of Carlos’s political opinions which, when one steps back to regard these objectively, every Filipino is entitled to express in the free market of ideas that is the Philippines’ platform for free expression. In so doing, nobody, certainly not one like Carlos who applies more than the average rigour to vetting the views she issues, deserves to be slapped a label by some two-bit “journalist”.
Indeed, Carlos has a vast body of scholarly work to her name — something a Rapplerette like Buan is unlikely to have parsed over a big enough sample set for solid bases for input into her “news reporting”. There’s also the more important matter of the Yellowtards actually being the true pioneers of cultivating  “pet analysts” to quote too when crafting “reports” that slant to their preferred narrative. An example of their dishonest produce is Buan’s fellow Rapplerette JC Punongbayan who is routinely put up as the unofficial Chief Yellowtard Economist.
Punongbayan is some sort of product of the University of the Philippines School of Economics — a PhD holder, we are told. He is known for his intellectually dishonest habit of backward-engineering his “analysis” from pre-determined politically-motivated “conclusions”. Back in 2018, he ran some sort of forum to explore the idea of the Philippine economy “in the time of Marcos and Duterte”. Just from the title of the forum alone, it was evident that Punongbayan sought to establish a causal relationship between the economy and the governments of the two men by merely correlating economic performance to the periods over which they governed. For all the curls in his do, Punongbayan seems to be unable to grasp the basic pitfall that discredits the work of most kiddie analysts like him — that causation cannot be readily-concluded from mere correlation.
I wrote back then…
The title of Punongbayan’s symposium aims to lure its audience into arriving at that perverted conclusion — that economic indicators that marked the administrations of Ferdinand Marcos and Rodrigo Duterte constitute proof that they caused the economic conditions these indicators described. This is bald dishonest use of data — feeding it into a patently rigged algorithm or evaluation method and publishing a conclusion that is not subject to critical evaluation by qualified people.
Small surprise that Rappler holds the distinction of being one of the least trusted media outlets in the Philippines. How, after all, can one have confidence in the soundness of a media channel that licenses “journalists” like Lian Buan to make sophomoric critiques (if it can even be called that) on the work of an academic stalwart such as Professor Clarita Carlos?
The University of the Philippines can “distance” itself from Professor Carlos all it wants. She is, after all, retired and no longer part of the UP faculty. Besides, that’s just UP being UP — the communist-infested den whose officials habitually presume to represent the sentiments of an otherwise diverse student body and community of alumni. Buan, for her part, should go back to “journalism” school and learn that there is more to writing “news reports” than indulging one’s personal political biases. Then again, perhaps that is exactly what Rappler is — a journalism school where a bunch of spoilt brats learn a perverse form of this craft on the job.",Others
Yellowtard “journalists” like @HowieSeverino would rather rely on hearsay information than do REAL research,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/yellowtard-journalists-like-howieseverino-would-rather-rely-on-hearsay-information-than-do-real-research/,"It all started out as a benign response to a tweet issued by GMA Network “broadcast journalist, anchor, host, documentarist and podcaster” Howie Severino. Evidently (at the time of this writing) travelling from Manila to South Korea soon, the eminent “journalist” tweeted, “Dear recent travelers to Korea, any new Covid/health requirements?” Only wishing to help, I tweeted what I thought was a helpful a response.
Clearly this was not something the admired “broadcaster” found insightful and the outcome of this lack of curiosity is an all-too-familiar Yellowtard response.
Interestingly enough, one of his followers — a certain Mary Anne Señir — later shared some research on the matter that she had taken the initiative to undertake and provided a link to a website run by the embassy of South Korea in the Philippines.
Hi, Sir. I’ve been doing a research on travel requirements of top destinations of Pinoys. Got this from the Korean Embassy visa section on Dec 14. Here’s the link mentioned in the email [Link provided]
The link opens a page containing the information Severino sought. Dated the 4th October 2022, the notice reads “Notice on the Lifting of PCR COVID-19 test after entering to the Republic of Korea(From Oct.1, 2022) […] We inform you that those who entered the Republic of Korea after midnight on October 1st do not have to undergo the COVID-19 PCR TEST after entering the country.” The date of the notice, perhaps, was something that gave Severino doubts prompting him to earlier tweet, “Much of the online info on Korea requirements seems outdated or conflicting. Info from real-world experience helps. Thanks friends :-)”
Whatever Severino meant by “info from real-world experience”, it seems the revered “documentarist” would rather believe disembodied voices on Twitter than a reliable source-of-truth such as a page from the Korean Embassy website. This is perhaps an outcome of the the Philippines being host to a low-trust society. Nonetheless, that didn’t stop him from retweeting the tweet, perhaps realising that he is, in fact, surrounded by idiots he decides he would rather not trust.
This sort of behaviour coming from a “thought leader” of the Philippine “journalism” establishment reveals the character of said community. It’s no wonder that Philippine “journalism” is at the state it’s in seeing how its top opinion-shapers are comfy “crowdsourcing” information that would otherwise have best been sourced from more authoritative channels. Acting and reacting on the basis of hearsay is at the root of much of the world’s evils and it is ironic that this behaviour is most observed in the leaders of a political camp that habitually shrieks the loudest about the “evils” of “disinformation”.",Others
What next for the Philippines’ DISCREDITED mainstream corporate news media?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/what-next-for-the-philippines-discredited-mainstream-corporate-news-media/,"The Philippines’ mainstream news media is in a death spiral. Many of the country’s top media outfits led by ABS-CBN, Rappler, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and even relatively professional CNN Philippines went for broke in this year’s elections. They bet their entire reputations on the campaign of now-failed Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo. They tossed all semblance of objectivity out the window and took part in the solidarity-in-desperation that characterised Robredo’s campaign particularly in the final weeks leading to the 9th of May.
Following all that, the buzzword among the stragglers in the aftermath of the landslide win of administration tandem Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte is “disinformation”. Marcos and Duterte, the losers insist, won on the back of a “disinformation campaign” — one mounted on a “massive” scale, they screech. In essence, the Yellowtards are attempting to gaslight the majority electorate into believing they were victims of a vast conspiracy to mislead them. To make things worse, key personalities employed by the very news organisations that now suffer severe crises of credibility remain unable to reflect on the self-inflicted damage to their priceless reputations seeing that they continue to amplify the baseless assertions of the partisan camps they evidently remain loyal to.
So where to for these media organisations who now suffer a colossal loss of face not to mention their place at the top of the pedestal they built for themselves and directed the audience they once monopolised to bow to? The credibility void their folly created is now rapidly being filled by new players — enabled by the very social media platforms they sought to police (an act of hubris that also contributed to further losing the trust of the Filipino people).
Mainstream media have to face reality — they need to compete for credibility in today’s hyper-competitive mass communication landscape. If it is the “disinformation” bogey they are worried about, they need to get over that phantom and, instead, focus on proving to an audience who enjoy an abundance of information channels to tune into that theirs is the real deal. Ultimately, however, the public has sole power to decide who is and who isn’t that real deal. No amount of fashioning one’s self to be “official fact checkers” and, believing so, presume to act as Disinformation Police will win back the trust of the public. Only the better brand will.
It is now a cliché but there is no denying the reality of the free market of ideas. The alternative is a policed market of the sort that “fact checkers” Maria Ressa of Rappler and Ellen Tordesillas of VERA Files aspire to institute on Facebook. Unfortunately for them Facebook is but one of many options for information dissemination that ordinary people are at liberty to sign up to. To count on policing the Net as being even possible and stubbornly hanging on to that notion is the sort of thing that, in all ironies, loses one precious ground. Issuing a label against a worthy opponent rather than competing with her head-to-head for worth in the sporting manner the free market demands is a comfy space Disinformation Crybabies prefer to inhabit. Yet again they had lost an entire people because of that laziness.",Others
Filipino movie and TV actors don’t know how to play rich people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/filipino-movie-and-tv-actors-dont-know-how-to-play-rich-people/,"Many people have been wondering why Filipino films and television shows are such massive cringes. On the surface, the most obvious observation is that the emotional hooks used by the template plots of these products are overused and obsolete. Shouting matches, loud monologues, and slapstick chatter pepper stories about “love” between characters from opposite sides of the tracks, one-dimensional infidelity, and infantile youth angst. In short, the cinematic devices haven’t evolved much since Lavinia Arguelles played by the late Cherie Gil issued the words “You’re nothing, but a second-rate trying hard copycat!” to Dorina Pineda played by Sharon Cuneta in the 1985 film Bituing Walang Ningning.
Unfortunately the root causes that contribute to the mediocre quality of Philippine cinema and TV run deeper. Filipino script writers are incapable of grasping the nuances of what it means to be a true member of the alta ciudad (high society). To top that with another layer of dysfunction, Filipino actors and actresses are woefully ill-equipped to play such characters. Back in 2018, Get Real Post contributor Kate Natividad wrote a damning piece about that year’s ABS-CBN Ball that captures the kernel of the bankrupt cultural faculties of Philippine showbiz that likely accounts for this creative deficit…
But the Filipino elite — the real ones — are nothing like the poor copies on exhibit in this Ball. To be fair, the untrained eye would be hard-pressed to find fault in the dresses of the girls. But, man, the boys. Their outfits were screaming f…. (sorry, we’re no longer allowed to used that word).
Natividad goes on to eviscerate any semblance of what’s left of a talent-poor industry’s pitch to much needed fresh blood…
Tasteful fashion is hard to get. Trying hard to get it makes it even harder. Perhaps the first step is to try to make working in showbiz a bit more of a viable career path for the supposed “best and brightest” of the private school set. Otherwise, all you’ll get are designers of stories and looks who know nothing about the “rich” characters they populate their dramas and romcoms with. That’s a tall order as well considering Pinoy showbiz has still to shake off the baduy stigma it suffers…
The sad fact is that people who write and perform for the Philippines’ mass entertainment businesses come from those baduy classes. As such, they craft the characters of their stories, direct their “talent”, and perform the parts using the underclass perspective they bring to the industry. The products are predictable: rich kids dressed in label-screaming outfits acting like assholes shouting at their servants in trying-hard English and poor folk doing the old batang yagit act to tug heartstrings. Really edgy stuff, right?
This is a huge gap considering that class war is the default thematic frame of most of Philippine mass entertainment products.
When will Philippine cinema and TV level up in a region of players already starting to give Hollywood a run for its money? It begins when a bit more reality and a bit less unimaginative melodrama and stereotypes are applied to the local craft. The world is an interesting place and, as such, offers no excuse to creators who suffer a deficit of imagination and a lack of focus on quality.",Others
An alliance between the Yellowtards and the Marcos dynasty forms the Philippines’ new ruling oligarchy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/an-alliance-between-the-yellowtards-and-the-marcos-dynasty-forms-the-philippines-new-ruling-oligarchy/,"In his Inquirer piece “Media, politics, and foreign relations”, columnist Randy David illuminates the recent media re-circus surrounding President Bongbong Marcos’s alleged history of drug use…
It must have taken no small amount of pressure by the former president to get [Senator Ronald “Bato”] Dela Rosa, his erstwhile police chief, to initiate an investigation into an alleged cocaine session involving Mr. Marcos that supposedly happened 12 years ago. Well, the senator is seeking re-election, and he may have been inveigled into thinking the Senate investigation could give him media exposure. But how to make something musty newsworthy again—that was the challenge. The new spin had to come from something previously unreported. That is where movie actress Maricel Soriano, in whose condo the 2012 cocaine session was supposed to have taken place, came in. Soriano’s appearance at the hearing—and whatever else her supposed link to Mr. Marcos might suggest—was more than enough to land Dela Rosa’s investigation in the news.
Perhaps just the most recent of his small contributions to efforts to undermine the credibility of the current admin but, in this one, David misses the real issue which is the performance of the Marcos administration thus far. You can’t help but think that his mindset is Marcos is the lesser evil when compared to the “demonic” former President Rodrigo Duterte, which is why he makes light of the accusation of drug use and the brouhaha over the mess of the secret agreement, initially being pinned on Duterte and what appears to be now, another one by the Marcos administration with the Chinese.
Marcos’ cocaine use is the worst kept secret in the alta sociedad of Manila. This began back in the day when they lorded it over Manila’s social set, with their extended barkada of children of Marcos government officials and cronies. It’s old news. The only issue which makes it relevant is how it can be tied in to the prevalence of drugs during the administration the late former President Noynoy Aquino, seemingly under the protection of its highest officials, all the way to Malacañan, which many have linked to the death of then Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Jesse Robredo and the filing of charges against its former Justice Secretary, Leila De Lima.
Robredo had been building up dossiers on government officials involved in illegal drugs and gambling. This was found out by Undersecretary Rico Puno who belonged to the Samar faction in the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. It was precisely the reason why he was given that appointment. The dossiers were part of Jesse’s grand strategy to become President in 2016.
One of the sterling traits of Yellowidiots is hypocrisy. The fact that Marcos is pro-US and intends to demolish the Duterte brand is enough common ground for the Yellowidiots to stop branding Marcos as a thief. They implore him to give the victims of the drug war justice by handing Duterte over to the International Criminal Court (ICC), if and when the time comes. The Araneta family to which First Lady Marie Louise “Liza” Araneta Marcos (née Marie Louise Cacho Araneta) is more Yellow than pro-Marcos which is another reason why the Yellowidiots have hope.
Those who voted for the UniTeam didn’t expect this to happen. They were looking forward to an end to political divisiveness. Unfortunately, what we have now is more of the same. The optics are excellent in the Marcos administration but governance is sorely lacking and while government working with the private sector should be a positive development, the signs are there that this is just another specie in the evolution of cronyism, which never actually became extinct, even if the late former President Cory Aquino said she would put a stop to it.
Perhaps this is why Globe Telecom is brazen enough to slap a transaction fee even if you’re transferring money from your BPI account to your GCash account or simply buying load for your Globe prepaid SIM. Pati yung limang piso o piso di pa pinatawad.
This is why critical thinking Filipinos aren’t enamored of the excellent optics and the press releases churned out by the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) about all the good Marcos is doing. They long for Duterte who protected them from such abuse by the oligarchs. You get the impression that Marcos is weak and the reason why that is so is because you know he’s not the only one making decisions of national importance. The leadership is a triumvirate of the president, the wife and the cousin. What will become of the country with the unholy alliance between the Marcos’ and the Yellowidiots?

Philippine elections 2025: Idiots equipped with smartphones with minds altered by social media are a menace!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/philippine-elections-2025-idiots-equipped-with-smartphones-with-minds-altered-by-social-media-are-a-menace/,"Too much social media? This is, of course, a global problem leading some countries like Australia to apply minimum age limits to the creation of accounts on popular social media services. This particular age limits “solution”, interestingly enough, highlights the core issue of how access to unregulated information poses a potential hazard to impressionable young minds.
Bad news then for the Philippines when one considers that this is a country renowned for its people’s stunted comprehension faculties. According to a recent report, inauthentic agents and communities on the Net have “shaped the conversation” surrounding this year’s mid-term elections there.
[…] up to 45% of discussions about the elections – a showdown between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and the Duterte camp – have been driven by inauthentic accounts, including sock puppets, avatars and bots.
“What we found in the Philippines isn’t just disinformation spike – it’s digital warfare,” said Cyabra’s chief executive, Dan Brahmy.
Step back and take the time to put two and two together. Potent mind-altering substances such as alcohol and narcotics have long been regulated and, in the case of the latter, prohibited. Severe penalties are applied to people who use them when operating dangerous machinery (which includes common road vehicles).
The key words here are mind-altering. It describes the key impact of these substances that make them dangerous. Upon this principle, one can then make a strong argument posed by unfettered access to that quintessentially 21st Century mind-altering drug — social media. People under the influence of this substance shouldn’t be allowed to operate dangerous machinery — such as mobile phones which are known to be the primary hardware used to spread disinformation. Like drunk drivers and deranged, ill-trained public bus and jeepney drivers, morons equipped with smartphones are a menace to society.
Think then of just how vulnerable the Philippines is to mind-altering technologies. It is a nation of lazy thinkers. It’s a huge ask of Filipinos to think things through before reacting or forming opinion about a piece of information they would come across over a given day. As a result, public discourse in the Philippines is characterised by a lack of new ideas or a failure to engage with new information. It is easy to observe that this has led to stagnation or decline in the nation’s collective intellectual abilities. Laziness and impoverished minds impede an entire people’s capacity to think critically and engage with the world in a meaningful way.
Indeed, as we observed in a previous article, 50% of Filipinos stunted at childhood in the 1980s could be why the Philippines is so intellectually-bankrupt today!
[Inquirer columnist Cielito Habito] cites the incidence of stunting in Filipino children — that “[the] World Bank sees us as having the fifth highest stunting prevalence in the East Asia and Pacific region, and among the top 10 countries worldwide with the most number of stunted children.” Physical stunting (which is the subject of the WB report) in children likely has a strong impact on brain development. This is the bomb Habito drops on his readers…
One can better appreciate how critical this all is knowing that a child’s first five years is the most critical period in shaping his/her life-long outcomes. There’s a simple reason for this: 90 percent of human brain development occurs by age 5. Development institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme thus see strategic interventions in those early years as the most efficient and effective means to address persistent social and economic inequities. A child stunted at age 5 only has the remaining 10 percent of brain development left, hence is damaged for life with lifelong effects on her/his physical, cognitive, linguistic, and socio-emotional abilities.
Tinapay na nga naging bato pa.
Suddenly it all makes sense. Wonder no more why Filipinos seem to suffer a clearly-evident collective intellectual bankruptcy today.
Therein lies the irony that flies way above Filipinos’ pointed heads. While many harp about the proliferation of “dangerous drugs” against which former President Rodrigo Duterte supposedly waged his “war” and for which he now languishes in The Hague before an “international criminal court”, few realise the technological drug that now addles the minds of an entire generation of young Filipino voters.",Others
Astounding double standard: Mainstream media mum over government intimidation of political bloggers,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/astounding-double-standard-mainstream-media-mum-over-government-intimidation-of-political-bloggers/,"Chalk another one up for the double standard of the Philippines’ mainstream media. On one hand, they would be up in arms over even the slightest hint of government and powerful politicians’ influence — much more suppression — of citizens’ rights to express themselves in a public forum. On the other, and in today’s case, they’d let slide an obvious concerted effort to suppress a strong collective voice.
At the core of this “debate” over freedom of expression is the assertion by politicians that certain bloggers and content creators are exploiting their large social media followings to disseminate information of questionable quality. Then again, if one would stop to step back from the tech media available today and look at the first principles here, how different is blogging and social media posting from the act of stepping onto a soapbox in a public square and shouting out one’s views?
To be fair, many digital content publishers apply malicious intent in the delivery of their craft. Some have, rightly so, been called out for the outright falsehoods they liberally pepper their work with. Then again, “journalists” employed by traditional media organisations would also be hard-pressed to disprove a lack of balance or malicious bias in their work. Indeed, look no further than the suspicious circumstances surrounding the founding of “social news media” organisation Rappler in 2012 — impeccably timed to coincide with the impeachment circus against the late Chief Justice (at the time) Renato Corona that was about to erupt. Rappler then joined other mainstream media organisations in an all-out demonisation campaign against Corona, publishing and amplifying outrageous and unverified information about him.
Worse things were perpetrated by this mob back then. Rappler “online reporter” Magtanggol de la Cruz published the balance of one of Corona’s foreign currency deposits in an article that bears the ironic title ‘Secrecy in foreign currency deposits‘ dated the 8th of Feb…
The latest one that has grabbed my attention has to do with whether or not a Philippine bank can be compelled via a subpoena to disclose information relating to a foreign currency bank deposit of its depositor, in this case, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The scuttlebutt, of course, is that Justice Corona has a US$[bleep] deposit held by the Philippine Savings Bank (PSBank) and that the prosecutors even know its account number.
…refering to a previous article dated the 4th of Feb where “online reporter” Carmela Fonbuena reveals not only that dollar amount but the account number where it is deposited as well…
The $[bleep] deposited in account number [bleep] is supposedly just one of 14 accounts that the Chief Justice and his wife Cristina individually and jointly own with daughter Carla Castillo and her husband Constantino III. Prosecution wants the branch manager of PSBank Katipunan branch to appear before the court and bring the bank documents on February 7, Tuesday.
All the above were potential criminal acts that reflected badly on the integrity of the then Senate impeachment trial court which, it can be argued, became party to violations of bank secrecy laws when it allowed admission of evidence obtained by unlawful means.
The short of it is that really bad things were done by supposedly credentialled “journalists” working for “reputable” corporate institutions such as Rappler. Why then is Congress today giving the time of day spending precious taxpayer funds turning the screws on small fry such as these personalities within the so-called “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) blogger community? Perhaps these content creators are, in fact, perceived to be a significant threat to today’s powers-that-be — a government and political camp that had, in fairness to them, handily outwitted their vastly more popular nemesis camp.
The camp of former President Rodrigo Duterte, unfortunately, have not much left other than an ability to stir up public discontent via the messaging of its cadre of political bloggers. In light of this, perhaps it would be sensible for the DDS community to carefully consider the quality and soundness of their methodology seeing that a desperate foe becomes more dangerous as their desperation escalates.",Others
The administration of the University of the Philippines is NOT a democracy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/the-administration-of-the-university-of-the-philippines-is-not-a-democracy/,"In her Inquirer piece “UP Diliman’s top-down leadership” today, columnist Anna Cristina Tuazon laments how “outside observers” are wont to “dismiss” the “passionate, sometimes chaotic expressions of [University of the Philippines (UP)] Diliman students, faculty, and staff” as “disrespectful behavior (or worse, to Red-tag them)”. She then goes on to suggest that members of this UP community are victims of “top-down decisions” that “have not served them well”.
The first big assumption Tuazon makes is a whopper — that those so-called “activists” who violently and destructively protested the decision of the UP Diliman Board of Regents (BOR) to to select UP College of Law dean Edgardo Carlo Vistan II over former UP Diliman chancellor Fidel Nemenzo (said “activists'” preferred candidate) as the new Chancellor of the UP Diliman campus are representative of the overall UP Diliman community. What is Tuazon’s basis for arriving at such a conclusion that she’d confidently state it categorically as fact in her column? Did she do a proper statistical analysis to check if her sample size allows her to assert that conclusion at 95 percent confidence? How many of those crybaby “activists” are even students of the UP Diliman?
The second assumption Tuazon makes is that the UP is administered as a “democracy” and makes an all-too-familiar appeal: “Genuine democracy requires allowing opposition to have a place in the arena of decision-making. Merely following top-down orders is not democracy. We cannot even elect our own leader, the minimum for democracy. To ridicule their outrage and protests is akin to ridiculing citizens who protest against their authoritarian regimes.” On the back of all that, Tuazon then issues this pompous challenge to the new chancellor (my boldface for emphasis):
Incoming Chancellor Vistan has a huge gap to reconcile. He has been appointed by the UP Board of Regents. He was not appointed by the people. To be a genuine leader of this headstrong multicultural community of fierce independent thinkers, he needs to realize sooner rather than later that his power will not come from the BOR but through the trust he will earn from the people he will serve.
The rules surrounding the appointment of a UP campus chancellor are clearly spelt out in the Administration page of the UP website: “The Chancellor of the constituent university shall be elected by the Board upon nomination of the President of the University, following a process of consultation with the constituents of the constituent university based on standards and guidelines set by the Board.” For its part, the Faculty Manual of the UP Diliman states, “Administration of each [constituent unit (CU)] is vested upon the Chancellor insofar as authorized by the Board of Regents and the UP President. The Chancellor of each CU is elected by the BOR upon nomination by the UP President.”
So, okkkaaayyy… “Opposition”? “Elect our own leader”? “Appointed by the people”? “Authoritarian regimes”? What was Tuazon smoking when she peppered her article with all this “activist” bullshit? Nowhere is it documented that who gets to be chancellor is determined “by the people”. The closest phrase available in official documentation that supports Tuazon’s UP-is-a-democracy ululation is that the BOR is expected to abide by “a process of consultation with the constituents” that is “based on standards and guidelines set by the Board”. Beyond that, Tuazon spins a mere personal fantasy of a “democracy” where none exists which she then dishonestly uses as a crude foundation for her quaint efforts to defend the infantile behaviour of the infantile “activist” community she is personally sympathetic to.
It is no wonder that Filipinos no longer trust Opposition “thought leaders” and their parrots in the media. They routinely insult their readers’ intelligence with their shrill melodrama and the bankrupt reasoning faculties they apply to their work.",Others
There is no evidence that Sass Rogando Sasot’s accounts on Facebook were deleted or banned for political reasons,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/there-is-no-evidence-that-sass-rogando-sasots-accounts-on-facebook-were-deleted-or-banned-for-political-reasons/,"The buzz going around at the moment is that popular pro-Duterte social media personality Sass Rogando Sasot was banned from Facebook. Both critics and supporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter, current Philippine Vice President Inday Sara Duterte, insist that this action taken by Facebook is “legit” after having been “checked”…
Critics of the Duterte clan and their legions of loyalist supporters (a.k.a. the Die-hard Duterte Supporters or “DDS”) have been long known to be rabid in their call to “deplatform” DDS influencers. The most recent victim of this witch-hunt is podcast program PumaPodcast which, back in May 2023, dared cast an episode featuring Sasot as a guest. Yellowtard “social news network” Rappler published a “report” on this travesty authored by a certain Jairo Bolledo that included cherry-picked opinions on the matter from various sources. The featured quote in Bolledo’s report pretty much summed up the slant…
One Twitter user said people shoot themselves in the foot when legitimate platforms are shared with individuals “who brought us to this political climate.” The same user added that personalities like Sasot “should be deplatformed, ostracized from public [forums], and her existence be erased from public memory.”
In the absence of a murder weapon, all that the amateur sleuthing surrounding Sasot’s demise on Facebook have to work with is motive on the bases of the above Rappler “report”. Well, that and a photo of Sasot holding up a phone that seemingly exhibits a message on Facebook notifying her of the suspension of her account.
Facebook does not normally issue any explanation for action it takes against user accounts. Its community standards guidelines are the only bases it offers. The most relevant guideline to Sasot’s case is likely the one on “misinformation” and this paragraph in particular…
We remove misinformation where it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm. We also remove content that is likely to directly contribute to interference with the functioning of political processes and certain highly deceptive manipulated media. In determining what constitutes misinformation in these categories, we partner with independent experts who possess knowledge and expertise to assess the truth of the content and whether it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent harm. This includes, for instance, partnering with human rights organisations with a presence on the ground in a country to determine the truth of a rumour about civil conflict, and partnering with health organisations during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
A clue (by a long shot, perhaps) is reference made by Facebook to “partnering with human rights organisations with a presence on the ground in a country to determine the truth of a rumour about civil conflict”. Rappler along with Vera Files are reportedly two of Facebook’s “fact check” partners in the Philippines. Indeed, The Straits Times reported back then…
VERA Files and Rappler IQ are the only two Philippine-based members of an international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in the United States.
Both of Facebook’s “partners” are widely known for their editorial slant in favour of the Philippines’ Yellowtard-Communist Axis. Vera Files was founded by Ellen Tordesillas who, for more than two decades, observers insist, published her “journalism” in the service of this camp. Back in April 2018 when Vera Files announced its “fact check” partnership with Facebook, Tordesillas was found to be lacking a working definition of “fake news” when grilled by then ANC Early Edition host Ian Esguerra.
Nonetheless, the idea that Sasot’s suspension from the Facebook platform was motivated by anti-Duterte agents that had infiltrated it is circumstantial at best. Unless more “legit” evidence that directly establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between Sasot’s “plight” and the political agendas of both the Yellowtard-Communist Axis as well as that of the camp of current President Bongbong Marcos (the latter also being accused of having a hand in this “censorship” campaign) can be presented, it is best, for now, to sit back and apply just a healthy enough dose of bemusement as we watch the usual Tardic Wars that Philippine politics is renowned for play out.",Others
Maria Ressa on a rampage as Reuters Institute report reveals Rappler among LEAST TRUSTED media organisations again,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/maria-ressa-on-a-rampage-as-reuters-institute-report-reveals-rappler-among-least-trusted-media-organisations-again/,"There’s something to be said about the consistency of Opposition “social news network” Rappler — in both its ability to make itself the news and the quickness of its CEO, Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate Maria Ressa to pounce on its critics. The 2023 Report on Digital Media published by the Oxford University based Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism revealed that a dismal 47 percent of survey respondents rated Rappler trustworthy, the lowest amongst media brands included in the study. Consistent to that, 33 percent of respondents indicated that they don’t trust Rappler — the highest amongst the included media brands.
Reuters Institute made sure to include the caveat that the study covered only a limited number of media organisations and, as such, the outcome “should not be treated as a list of the most or least trusted brands as it is not exhaustive.” This and other clarifications called out by Reuters Institute on its report did not stop Ressa from launching into a monumental tantrum over what she considers a piece of content that could be “weaponised” against her lot…
We are not alone. This ‘study’ is like giving a loaded gun to autocratic governments trying to silence independent journalists not just in the Philippines but in countries like Brazil and India, where information operations and the lawfare are used to persecute, harass, and chill.”
It admits that social media has taken over distribution, but it is not critical of biases that are implicit in social media and how this has turned the world upside down…
In response, the Institute fielded a tweet in which they expressed how they were sorry that their work “has been abused and [that] Maria Ressa thinks our methodology risks undermining media in the Global South” but then points out a post where their director Rasmus Nielsen “explains that we stand by our work, how we reviewed it, and steps taken to mitigate any abuse”.
Based on these reviews and the input we have received, we believe the survey methodology, questions, and research findings in the Digital News Report are robust. Our approach has undergone review by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee, it serves as the basis for many peer-reviewed academic publications both by ourselves and many other researchers who rely on the data and cite our work, and is pursued under the University’s Code on academic integrity in research, which explicitly prohibits the omission of inconvenient data from analysis and publication. In line with the latter, we always seek to present data that we believe is robust in a consistent way across all the brands and countries covered.
Ressa, in an all-too-familiar effort to have the last word on the matter, rejected the apology over a 10-tweet thread where she called upon her cronies in the industry for backup…
It’s not enough to be sorry when your work is used to attack journalists in “inconvenient” countries.  Journalism research has no integrity if it endangers journalists at risk. How did this “study” fare in South Africa @brankobrkic? Or in Brazil @camposmello?
After 4 years of behind-the-scenes feedback with no substantive changes and no acknowledgement of its harms, you have to ask – what is the purpose of this research? Of the bar graphs that are meant to get attention at our expense.
From last year: Excerpt from my email from 7/4/22: “f you don’t acknowledge your mistake, you will repeat it – and other more vulnerable news groups may not weather it as well as we can …”
From 7/4/22: ” … because the government and its propaganda machine are now using Oxford University against us (which is the reason RISJ must be beyond reproach, and in this case, you’re not – and you will continue to make the same mistake until you acknowledge it).”
From 7/4/22: “The graphics you have used through the years are misleading and lack proper labels. The note you quote, ‘should not be treated as a list of the most trusted brands’ is not enough when it’s not part of the chart itself.”
(The tirade continues from there over several more tweets.)
This is behaviour that is telling of the character of Ressa and the culture of the news organisation she heads. Whenever data does not fit the preferred narrative, it is “flawed” — or so goes the thinking of these people. Ressa herself has long demonstrated that she is, herself, not above using bogeymen that are products of her slanted imagination to prop up her storytelling. For example, she shrieks that “the government and its propaganda machine are now using Oxford University against us” and expects that to stand on its own as “evidence” of her victimhood.
The Reuters Institute was overly generous in what is essentially an unnecessary apology. It does a service to all that this fine institute is committed to stand by its data and the interpretation of this data in the informative manner with which it was delivered to the public.",Others
Why is Philippine politics so full of drama?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/why-is-philippine-politics-so-full-of-drama/,"If the Philippines got a penny whenever wonder over its dysfunctional politics is raised, it’d be a First World country by now. Indeed, emotionalism reins supreme in the National “Debate” there. Facts and critical thinking routinely take a back seat to shrill hysterics exchanged amongst its foremost “thought leaders”. Social media had exacerbated this predisposition to unproductive mudslinging and the landscape is increasingly hopelessly paralysed.
The most evident manifestation of this dysfunction is the continued coalescing into cults of personality among the country’s chattering classes. Having been utterly crushed in the 2022 national elections, the Yellowtard-Communist Axis — regarded widely as the bloc of left-of-centre “liberals” — are a scattered, hopelessly-fragmented and ineffective force. For its part, having taken hold of the nation, the arguably right-wing “Unity Team” of winning tandem of Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte — now President and Vice President respectively — are now seeing their support base polarised into the Marcos “BBM” and Duterte “DDS” camps.
The common denominator here, aside from the traditional stupidity of the “debate” surrounding these “developments” is continued beholdenness to personalities. Issues are not unpacked in this “debate” through the application of systematic thinking. They are regarded from the lens of the perceived personal loyalties of the actors and agents contributing to it. It is easy to see why no conversation moves forward. The intellectual bankruptcy of the landscape turned what is supposed to be a free market of ideas into a deadly minefield where most great ideas get blown up trying the navigate it.
One has to be baduy to make a mark as an “influential” in today’s political chatter. But even in cultivating a baduy persona, one needs to be consistent. Failed presidential candidate Leni Robredo learnt this the hard way when she made a misguided foray into baduy theatrics during her ill-fated campaign. She is supported by a community made up of Manila’s chi chi private school elite to which she makes a woke social justice appeal. As such, her pedestrian antics come across as absolute cringe.
One can easily argue that all this merely mirrors society today in the age of social media and the shortening of attention spans this state of things has induced. However, all things being equal, Filipino minds have proven to be particularly predisposed to being easily-swayed by theatrics. Even before social media became a thing, Philippine politics was already known for its showbiz character and lowest-common-denominator “debate”. Even before the Internet became a ubiquitous household technology, Filipinos were already voting uneducated celebrities to office and gushing over unqualified scions of manufactured “national heroes”.
To be fair, all this makes Philippine politics fertile ground for the sorts of “influencers” we see today — baduy and malaswa and all mukhang pera. There are no principles at stake, only personal brands and access to power. This is pure capitalism in an industrially-bankrupt economy — except that no assets are created and brand equity is fleeting as evident in the way once-prominent personalities flame out under the weight of their individual dependencies on patrons and lack of a foundation of stable principles. Add to that an inability to innovate in their approach to messaging and we get what is all clearly evident today — an intellectually bankrupt society.",Others

Big fucking deal. It was all inevitable. These bozos were once best friends for life. Now they are sworn enemies.
See, this is why we at GRP don’t make friends with fellow bloggers. The minute you do, the sooner your freedom to write whatever you want gets compromised. There’s more to life than blogging and that means one necessarily has a life outside of the blogosphere that is inaccessible to ordinary members of our audience. The blogosphere is just a place to express ones views. I don’t see it as a place to make friends.
This is why Get Real Philippines persists as the one and only real objective blog outlet on the Philippine social issues landscape. It’s because we’re not in this space to make friends or form alliances. Why are we here? We’re here to invite people to prove us wrong. And guess what: so far, nobody’s stepped up to that challenge.
We’re in this for the pure intellectual pursuit. We’re here to test concepts. We’re not here to worship people. We’re here to stand by ideas. As the late former US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was said to have said…
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
The only real way one can come across as stupid in a debate is to declare one’s loyalty to a cult of personality as a credential of some sort. Since when has being a Dutertard, Marcostard, or Lenitard been a basis for determining how right or wrong someone is? Only in the Philippines, it seems. The fact is, “you’re wrong because you’re a Marcos supporter” holds as little water as “you’re wrong because you are a Duterte supporter”. Camps that spend the bigger chunk of their time doing deep “investigations” into how rabidly-loyal (or disloyal, for that matter) one or the other bozo is to their cult leader are all dens of intellectual bankruptcy.
So where does all this leave the Philippine blogosphere? With not much. Philippine society has long been known as an intellectually-bankrupt cesspool. World IQ rankings substantiate that fact, the dismal state and priority placed on public education proves it, and the quality of Filipino social and political blogs mirror this confronting reality.
So why is it so hard for Filipino “thought leaders” to come across as anything more than stupid? Maybe it’s because they talk about people a lot. Coffee in my Coffeemate, cereal in my milk. Makes sense to me.",Others
Marcos Loyalists like @TheaDTan continue to pretend there is no organised demolition campaign against the Dutertes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/marcos-loyalists-like-theadtan-continue-to-pretend-there-is-no-organised-demolition-campaign-against-the-dutertes/,"Diplomats normally pursue peaceful solutions and don’t agitate for war. Does  House Speaker Martin Romualdez really want a shooting war to breakout between the US and China over the Philippines? The Marcos Loyalists praise President Bongbong Marcos for his hardline stance on Philippine sovereignty over the so-called disputed areas when this is clearly not the case even if we go by the arbitral tribunal ruling. The Scarborough Shoal was lost because of Uncle Sam through the deal it brokered with China and arbitral tribunal ruling. It also wasn’t included in any of the treaties signed by the United States when the Philippines was still its colony.
So now we have Marcos propagandists calling out the Vice-President to issue a statement with the implication that her silence is tantamount to treason.
Isn’t this a narrow view of a complicated issue? I’m not a stalker or a troll unlike someone who used to listen in quietly when I used to go on Spaces on a regular basis. Now I find out the information I shared was used by said someone for their own benefit later on. If this isn’t intellectual thievery then I don’t know what is. Let’s cut the crap about there not being any organized campaign against the Dutertes because obviously there is. As I keep on repeating, the optics are excellent in the Marcos administration but where is the substance?
For the record, I have also called out the Vice-President for her errors of omission, such as referring to the NPA as the national people’s army in her statement against the resumption of peace talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF. There is also the matter of her obviously reading from the teleprompter which Marcos also does. It’s funny how a propagandist goes to the extent of calling out “Duterte’s trolls'” inability to “elucidate” and understand the “nuances” of her arguments. Pray tell, how can a troll have intellectual depth to begin with? It’s not like any of the loyalist propagandists possess the same.
It’s best that we just stick to the facts. As I’ve pointed out in a separate  post, it was former President Rodrigo Duterte who paved Marcos’s path to the presidency. Would Marcos have won by a landslide without a Duterte by his side? This article in a German publication reinforces the claim that victory by “the Marcos, Duterte, Macapagal-Arroyo, and Estrada families, along with their allies” was achieved through a disinformation campaign targeted at the masses.
…the [2022] elections turned into an asymmetric battle dominated by a well-funded machinery of mostly unseen non-traditional actors, but directed by the usual suspects, working since 2015 using new, tech-based and data-driven tools that systematically supplied wholesale disinformation, manipulated public opinion, and quietly perverted everyday narratives accessible to most Filipinos. The disinformation, narratives, and messages of political micro-targeting were eventually refined and sharpened over the six years of the Duterte administration to make the political coalition led by the top families (Marcos, Duterte, Macapagal-Arroyo, and Estrada) the preferred choice of voters.
What it doesn’t take into account is the genuine dissatisfaction of a majority of Filipinos over the administration of the late former President Benigno Aquino III who ran the Yellow brand to the ground over his term of office from 2010 through 2016. The article claims that Marcos is just as “illiberal” as Duterte but lo and behold, he has basically fulfilled the campaign promises of his leftist-liberal opponent. The leadership of the leftist-militant groups don’t even dare mention his name on social media platforms over the enforcement of the final deadline for the public utility vehicles (PUV) modernization which would see the phase-out of the decrepit jeepneys that have been the bane of generations of Filipino commuters. These very same leftist-militant “activists” had long rallied behind the operators and drivers of these affronts to modern public transport.
The same is true with the Yellowidiots. The quote from Hitchens applies to those who are equally noisy but bereft of substance.

It seems Romualdez would rather spend his tax-funded time campaigning for the next election than doing his job crafting laws in his office. Then again stunts like this usually work, to be fair — because Filipinos are always up for a bit of free food scraps tossed at them by one or the other two-bit politician.
One does not need to look too far back to find an example of this sort of dishonest behaviour in former senator and failed presidential wannabe Mar Roxas who spent most of his time in the various offices he occupied performing before the cameras.
Behaviour like this is usually most evident in the lead up to an election. The timing of Romualdez’s quaint stunts is astounding in that it has only been a bit more than a year since the last national elections in 2022 and he is already on the campaign trail wasting people’s already-small attention spans. Yet it is unlikely that people like Romualdez, in their normal daily lives, ever give their next meal a second thought. Indeed, most people like him expect a proper breakfast spread laid out for them by their servants every morning as a matter of normal routine among other things.
The only real way politicians can convince people they are for real is to live like real Filipinos over a long enough period of time that actually hurts. Sometime back within the context of similar PR stunts involving politicians being photographed taking public transport to show their “solidarity” with hapless Filipino commuters I proposed in my piece “How can Metro Manila ever improve if Filipino politicians do not take public transport?” how one could really walk the talk…
If Filipino polticians want to make epal, why not make them do it all the way. Here is what I propose Filipinos — Metro Manilans in particular — demand of their politicians:
Start taking public transport everyday for the next two years leading to the 2016 elections.
Any baboon can make like a traffic cop or a palengkero for the 15 minutes it takes to produce a campaign video. But if Filipino politicians want to demonstrate how serious they are about improving the lot of ordinary Filipinos who, as part of their day-to-day lives, suffer the results of decades of government mismanagement, they should show Filipinos that they can take personal accountability for the idiocy of the government they want to be officers of.
If House Speaker Martin Romualdez would rather spend his tax-funded time making epal before the cameras, perhaps he should go the whole nine yards and do it properly. Show Filipinos he can afford food and enjoy a decent standard of living within the means a normal Filipino income allows. Otherwise, he should just go back to his office and do his job.",Others
Rappler admits USAID funding but still neither confirms nor denies receiving grants from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED),https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/rappler-admits-usaid-funding-but-still-neither-confirms-nor-denies-receiving-grants-from-the-national-endowment-for-democracy-ned/,"Yellowtard “social news network” Rappler continues to flail over the gutting of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by US President Donald Trump. Gaby Baizas, a “digital forensics researcher” there insists in her piece “The lies, attacks on USAID spreading in the Philippines” that “USAID has been providing humanitarian aid to several countries, including the Philippines” and that “[its] programs aim to address a variety of key issues, such as access to public health, ending conflict in poor regions, promoting democracy and human rights, among others”.
Baizas also defends the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) which, she also insists, “was created in 1983 to support programs that promote good governance, human rights, and democratic values in nearly 100 countries around the world.” Note that Baizas categorically stated in her “report” that “Rappler, Vera Files, and PCIJ were partners of the USAID-funded Initiative for Media Freedom (IMF) project by Internews” as part of funding extended to “select Philippine news outlets for certain periods during the previous Duterte administration”. However, it is also interesting to note that Baizas made no similar categorical disclosure or denial of Rappler’s relationship with NED opting, instead, to use these nebulous words…
Before the current hate campaign against USAID and NED, Duterte’s disinformation networks had already blasted independent Philippine newsrooms that have received funding from NED for their fact-checking initiatives. Yet, this has always been publicly disclosed; Rappler and Vera Files stated they receive grants for their fact-checking, research, and media and information literacy efforts, while PCIJ said they receive funds for its training seminar-workshops.
Note the text in italics (formatted as such by this author). Baizas “reports” that Rappler and Vera Files “receive grants” but was not entirely explicit in stating categorically who disbursed these grants. Was the NED, aside from USAID, one such grantor?
Whatever, right? Either way, Rappler CEO (and Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate) Maria Ressa should issue stronger instructions to her “reporters” to check their “facts”. It is worth considering that Ressa and her stakeholders see this is a fact checking issue or an issue to do with being consistent with the overarching agenda of their fellows in the Yellowtard-Communist Axis that, for so long, have been battling the forces of “fascism”. Fascism, from their perspective, apparently is anything and everything to do with whatever is associated with their two favourite bogeymen — former president Rodrigo Duterte and current President Bongbong Marcos (i.e., for that matter, anyone in power who is not a part of their Axis).
Ressa may find it interesting that her pals in the Philippines’ left-leaning “activist” communities are, ironically, not very big fans of Uncle Sam’s “foreign aid” — whether coursed via USAID or the NED. Indeed, they even express skepticism around whether these are all in aid of democracy (as Rappler’s “researchers” assert) to begin with. Sonny Africa, director of IBON Foundation, a leftist “non-profit research, education and information-development institution with programs in research, education and advocacy based in the Philippines”, wrote in a paper back in 2013 of how the United States “used this [aid] as leverage for an increased US military presence in the Philippines as part of its global ‘war on terror’.” Africa further writes of this focus on military aid; how it continues “even as the Philippine military and its paramilitary forces have been found to be complicit in mounting human rights violations and a wave of political killings, forced disappearances and abductions.”
Of the component of “aid” channelled to the Philippines via USAID, Africa notes that these had “become concentrated in local community projects in the Mindanao region”. He then suggests that these were mostly covertly in support of the US military agenda citing how “[these] southern provinces were the re-entry point for US military forces in the country in 2002. Since 2002, there has been in the Philippines a continuous presence of US troops – from a few hundred to over 6,000 (especially in Mindanao) – pre-positioning of war materiel and the transit of US forces heading for Afghanistan and Iraq.”
Hardly surprising then that the Axis routinely fails in its efforts to get messaging out that resonates over a broad swathe of the Filipino public.

The Dutertard “influencers” need to EVOLVE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/the-dutertard-influencers-need-to-evolve/,"The circle of “influencers’ surrounding former President Rodrigo Duterte and his clan, which includes current Vice President Sara Duterte, need to shape up. The cult of personality approach where everything is an appeal to emotion — personal loyalty, patriotism, regionalism, and the all-time greatest hit, utang na loob (debt of gratitude) have all become passé. Yet these comms relics continue to be flogged by the “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) mob.
Strip all the shrill emotionalism from the “issue” of the former president’s “plight” in The Hague under the thumb of the “International Criminal Court” (ICC) and we are left with a few sensible things to work with top of which is the questionable nature of the ICC itself and its manufactured jurisdiction as a “court” to reckon with and, as such, the sketchy circumstances surrounding how a Filipino citizen — a former chief executive, no less — was simply packed up and handed over to a foreign colonial power.
But then even discounting the formidable critical mass of “international law” and the Global North powers that enforce it, Duterte is a difficult man to defend. Foremost is his own predisposition to self-incrimination. He is first to not just admit but boast about his homicidal approach to law enforcement encompassing his gigs as Davao City mayor and President of the Philippines. Philippine Presidents, after all, are all the same in the extrajudicial manner with which they kill anyone they perceive to be a threat to their feudal clan. The sensible ones, however, do so covertly. Duterte wasn’t — and isn’t — as subtle nor as discreet. Neither is he as sensible.
Those are the key facts surrounding this latest circus. The “content creators” buzzing around this clown show should then work with these factual input and stop their incessant rosary rallies of delivering tired DDS slogans ad nauseum. Work on building sound arguments and educated scenarios and enough of the batang yagit, Joan Of Arc, and Rudy Fernandez narratives!
Perhaps a tad too vulcan for the OA Fipino mind? Fair enough. Maybe a bit of emotional icing can be slathered over the propaganda cake. Consider then that the Philippines now has the distinction of being the only Asian country that voluntarily handed over a former head of state to a former colonial power. Nakakahiya, right? The perfect touch for a society motivated by hiya and not much else.
The perfect time for strategic innovation is now given that the “thought leaders” of the true enemy here — the Yellowtard-Communist Axis — are showing no signs of strategic competence in story telling either. Are the Dutertards up to the job? As always, abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Others
Patricia Evangelista’s bullshit published on The @NewYorker,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/patricia-evangelistas-bullshit-published-on-the-newyorker/,"The basic problem with Rappler‘s journalists has always been their reportage adheres to the cliché of the “rules-based international order,” which is whatever is the latest dictate in the West about social and moral mores. At the country level, they don’t bother to take into account what the reality is on the ground.
The latest source of high-profile Western “insight” into the situation in the Philippines, however, revolves around former Rapplerette Patricia Evangelista. She, along with her new book Some People Need Killing, are the subjects of a piece published on the New Yorker and authored by David Remnick. Remnick calls Evangelista “a very rare talent” who has “written a journalistic masterpiece”. Basing his views on what he was told by Rappler CEO and Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate Maria Ressa, Remnick writes…
Ressa would surely be the first to say that there would have been no Nobel, and very little truth in the Duterte era, were it not for the meticulous reporting of Evangelista and others like her. Evangelista was on the street every night, surveying the horror, examining the corpses, talking to the grieving families, and prodding the police. She wrote news pieces, and she wrote longer investigations.
…or so he and many of us keep being told.
Ask any average Filipino if they thought the drug problem of the country in 2016 was serious or not and their answer would be yes. I saw it for myself and several of my friends had close kin who had drug problems, particularly ones involving shabu. I had verified information also that several officials of the administration of the late former President Benigno Aquino III were protectors of drug lords. It was why the problem was prevalent and most or the majority of the barangays had to contend with it.
Evangelista writes about impunity but she fails to take into account the bigger picture; the menace to society and what effect it had on the victims of heinous crimes as a direct effect of the problem and that of the drug addicts and pushers families themselves. More laughable is how Evangelista claims that she had to move to New York because her life was in danger.
Now, how long has it been since you left the Philippines?
A few months, give or take. It was recommended that it was in my best interests.
What does that mean?
It means we don’t know the risk of my having released this book. There was a security assessment, and the assessment was, Get the fuck out.
And do you think you’ll go back?
Yes, absolutely. When I’ll go back is not certain, but I have to go back. It’s not moral patriotism or anything—that’s my home. And the story is ongoing. It’s not over. People are still dying on the streets. Journalists have been shot in Manila. And there are many other stories that have to be told about my country. I am a field reporter; that’s where I belong.
Bullshit. Evangelista’s mother is the sister of a good friend of mine. Their ancestral home is in Heroes Hills QC. No journalists, who were staunch critics of former President Rodrigo Duterte, were killed during his six-year term. It’s common knowledge that cRappler is funded by American liberal interest groups and the CIA front organizations as well. The very people who are against Duterte can hardly be called Filipinos because they don’t think and act like the typical Filipino. Maria Ressa herself is an interloper because the Philippines allows her to have dual citizenship.
Patricia Evangelista didn’t move to New York because of death threats. She moved to New York because that’s been her lifelong dream; to be an American and move in the intellectual and literary circles of the journalistic elite in America.",Others
“Some people need killing”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/some-people-need-killing/,"Former Rapplerete Patricia Evangelista used this as the title of her book on — what else? — the allegedly murderous administration of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

Buan “reports” that this “book launch” was hosted by “Columbia Journalism School’s Dart Center”.

Buan goes on to “report” that Rappler CEO and winner of last year’s Nobel “Peace Prize” Maria Ressa calls Evangelista’s book “the best narrative literary journalism to come out of our country.” But of course, right? And, yes, no “reporting” from these people would be complete without the customary presentation of evidence that all this gushing is validated by some dude from a noted Western establishment…

Philippine society elite ridicule Vice President Sara Duterte’s Visayan accent,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/philippine-society-elite-ridicule-vice-president-sara-dutertes-visayan-accent/,"Remember how the ouster of former President Joseph ‘Erap’ Estrada was engineered by the Yellowidiots led by former presidents Fidel ‘Tabako’ Ramos and Cory Aquino in 2001? Then when former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA) and Cory got into a tiff over Hacienda Luisita, the Yellowidiots turned against GMA and began a demolition job on her for the rest of her term. When Noynoy Aquino won the presidency in 2010, his first order of business was to lock her up at Veterans Memorial Hospital.
We see now that every lever is being similarly pulled to cast Vice President Sara Duterte as an object to launch a hundred administrative and “activist” movements against. Even the trivial is not spared as is evident in how the media now amplify “viral” mockery of the VP’s Visayan accent in this latest example of lazy “journalism”, “‘Shimenet’: The new term going viral online” published by the Philippine Star to capitalise on a snippet taken from Duterte’s response she gave during an ongoing budget hearing…
“Everyone has the right to know about these. It’s a matter of public interest. We are asking for transparency and accountability,” Brosas said.
The vice president responded, “She may not like my answer. She may not like how I answer. She may not like the content of my answer, but I am answering.”
However, Filipinos noticed that Duterte’s pronunciation of “she may not” sounded like “shimenet,” and that spawned dozens of memes and humorous edits online.
In what is but the most recent example of dishonest news “reporting” where “journalists” cherry-pick social media posts to bolster their preferred narrative, author Kristofer Purnell exhibits the gold nugget of this “report” citing a post on the subject issued by award-winning international starlet Dolly de Leon on X. Evidently, de Leon too found it funny.
Doesn’t this sound familiar because history seems to be repeating itself with the Marcoses and the Dutertes? What’s happening now in the Philippines isn’t only a political battle but also a class war. Former President Rodrigo Duterte is the promdi who made it to the presidency in 2016 but his family didn’t make an effort to climb the ladder of Manila’s high society because they aren’t plastic. What’s happening now is simply the hypocrisy of their political enemies being exposed. The so-called fe buena familia Marcos, Araneta and Romualdez plus the pretending-to-be-concerned-for-the-poor cadre of leftist-militant bohemians.
I don’t know about you but to my mind, the administration of President Bongbong Marcos is just a repeat of the second Aquino administration. The two scions of the greatest rivals in Philippine politics are no different from each other. They’re cut from the same cloth. Worse is the fact that instead of leading an evolution into an issues-based public discourse, the two camps sustain and encourage all the traditional ad hominem attacks from the “influencers” of both camps the members of which suffer from an absence of intellectual depth. These morons target the masa, who prefer not to work, but instead wait for the ayuda to be handed down by politicians to them in exchange for votes.

Shutdown SMNI and Seize Quiboloy’s Assets!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/shutdown-smni-and-seize-quiboloys-assets/,"There is a call from certain sectors for the Marcos Junior Administration to shutdown SMNI and seize Apollo Quiboloy’s assets in connection with the warrant for his arrest by the FBI. Likewise other sectors say that Quiboloy being strongly sympathetic to China, could make for a dangerous confluence with suspected armed Chinese sleeper cells in the country.
According to the official FBI website, the arrest warrant was issued upon his indictment by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Santa Ana, California, for conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion and sex trafficking of children; sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion; conspiracy; and bulk cash smuggling, and on November 10, 2021.
The page on which his arrest warrant appears on the FBI site further states:
Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the founder of a Philippines-based church, is wanted for his alleged participation in a labor trafficking scheme that brought church members to the United States, via fraudulently obtained visas, and forced the members to solicit donations for a bogus charity, donations that actually were used to finance church operations and the lavish lifestyles of its leaders. Members who proved successful at soliciting for the church allegedly were forced to enter into sham marriages or obtain fraudulent student visas to continue soliciting in the United States year-round.
Furthermore, it is alleged that females were recruited to work as personal assistants, or “pastorals,” for Quiboloy and that victims prepared his meals, cleaned his residences, gave him massages and were required to have sex with Quiboloy in what the pastorals called “night duty.”
In a response to the indictment which was published around June 2023, Quiboloy said that the accusations against him were fabricated as well as religious and political persecution.
He also issued a challenge — presumably to the US government — to reveal everything they have against him and he will show that he is “bullet proof”.
His actual words were, “Ilabas niyo lahat ng bala niyo sa akin. Gusto ko lang ipaalam sa inyo, bulletproof ako.”
Perhaps meaning that he cannot be made to submit to the US court or that the charges against him would not prosper.
Otherwise, it would be outlandish to think he meant he could actually survive being shot using all of the guns at the disposal of the US Armed Forces. Then again, Quiboloy has been known for his outlandishness and one of the most widely known was his claim of commanding an earthquake in Mindanao to stop — that is, apart from his moniker “appointed son of God.”
That said, the Philippine Department of Justice has not said anything about Quiboloy’s FBI arrest warrant since December last year, after Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla assured that the PH-US extradition treaty would be followed. However, DOJ Spokesman Mico Clavano said that the DOJ had not yet received a request for extradition and such would only happen if the US government takes action in the Philippines.
In the meantime, Quiboloy has been using SMNI’s social media accounts and other social media accounts associated with SMNI to contradict the Philippine as well as the US stand on China’s aggressive moves in the West Philippine Sea.
Quiboloy, a known close associate of former President Rodrigo Road Duterte, is known to be strongly sympathetic to China and has allowed SMNI to be used for pro-China propaganda on the WPS.
Given the considerable resources of Quiboloy’s church and large number of followers, he could be potentially troublesome to the PH-US alliance against Chinese aggression in the WPS.
This could conceivably even lead to a confluence with suspected Chinese armed clandestine moves which former DILG Secretary Rafael Alunan spoke about recently.
In a Facebook post, Alunan III voiced concerned over the discovery of the so-called “sleeper cell” in an exclusive subdivision in Pasig City where the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) captured six suspected Chinese terrorists and two. Filipino on October 16.
According to a report, several high-powered firearms branded “From People’s Republic of China” with badges labeled “blasting team,” “recon team,” “support team,” “assault team” were seized from the suspects.

We need a more INTELLIGENT “troll” narrative,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/we-need-a-more-intelligent-troll-narrative/,"The Filipino people need to put their collective foot down and take the social media “troll” narrative back into the level playing field of the broader public discourse. At the moment, the “woke” members of the Opposition, particularly the most rabid bloc within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards), presume to be the sole judge of who is a “troll” or what a “troll” is. They exercise their self-appointment as judges in a Yellowtard court they set up with their liberal Mainstream Media allies to both rule on and bear down on those they summarily deem to be “trolls”.
Manila Times columnist and self-appointed “social media expert” Noemi Dado so succinctly encapsulates this arrogant and presumptuous position Yellowtardom takes on “troll” politics here…
“Trolls [and] supporters [of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte] are mostly reactive to the organic display of criticism,” said Noemi Dado, a blogger and member of the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation. “Duterte is supposed to have a high satisfaction rating… so the trolls must make it look like Duterte is loved.”
…that it was used as a key reference in the now-infamous dishonest Washington Post “report” authored by its Manila correspondent Regine Cabato which I featured in a previous article.
Cabato’s public dishonesty stems from her attempt to mislead people into thinking that the main criteria used by Twitter to suspend users is their support for the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. This is evident in the title of said piece, “Twitter suspends accounts defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic”.
Totally dishonest indeed. Twitter, like many other large social media platforms, apply generally consistent sets of guidelines to ensure “community standards” are adhered to but don’t include any sort of partisan affiliation as criteria for determining violations. Thus, to claim that Twitter singles out “accounts defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic” is absolutely unfounded.
Cabato’s behaviour when challenged to clarify the sloppy journalism she subjects her readers to is also typical of the arrogance “woke” Opposition partisans contribute to the national discourse. Cabato says she finds it “troubling when the people who advise our politicians’ campaigns are informed by Get Real PH instead of news organizations.” This is a bit sad coming from a Washington Post “reporter” seeing how a person employed by an enterprise within a declining industry struggles to defend it. Indeed, “news organisations” aren’t exactly enjoying their heyday as far as people’s trust goes nowadays. “Journalists” are seriously overdue for a bit of reflection seeing how practitioners such as Cabato routinely make assertions they are woefully unable to back with verifiable specifics.
In the end, the only recourse “woke” people like Cabato habitually take is to silence people who dissent.
Ironic, right? More so considering that Cabato describes herself in her Twitter profile as a “tough cookie” who “blooms in adversity”.
Double unfortunate is how “woke” journalism pulls down into the abyss it is falling into erstwhile noble liberal Western concepts such as “human rights”. No less than Filipino “human rights” guru himself, the eminent Carlos Conde, weighed in on the Cabato imbroglio tweeting that, “[if] you are a journalist and you get attacked by the morons over at Get Real PH, that means you are doing your job.”
Let’s examine more closely Conde’s logic, which basically goes like this…
IF you get “attacked” by GRP;
THEN “you are doing your job”
Scratch that. The above is an insult to the very notion of logic. Conde fails at the most basic principle of intelligent conversation — establishing a sound premise to frame one’s argument. Conde builds his entire argument upon two lame pillars: (1) that Cabato was “attacked” by GRP and (2) that Cabato was “doing her job”. Firstly, Conde has so far failed to exhibit any evidence that such an attack transpired and continues to fail to produce such despite several challenges to step up and do so. And then there is the idea that Regine Cabato was “doing her job”. Perhaps she was. The question is what defines said “job”? Was it a job as a true journalist in the honourable sense of the profession, or a job as lackey of the owners of the very chi chi but increasingly irrelevant Washington Post?
Dialling back to what defines a real troll, it seems that self-proclaimed “thought leaders” like “social media expert” Noemi Dado, Washington Post “reporter” Regine Cabato, and “human rights activist” Carlos Conde are the ones who exhibit the very trollish behaviour they presume to rail about. They issue assertions they are unable to substantiate specially when challenged to do so, make liberal use of credentials to demand that their arguments be deferred to, defend their hollow assertions using medieval reasoning, and silence dissent when challenged to respond.
It is high time Filipinos open their eyes to the blatant insult to their intelligence these people dishonestly institutionalise as “thought leadership” and “journalism”. It’s time Filipinos take back their public political discourse and take to task those who seek to pervert it towards their insidious agendas.",Others
There is no proof Twitter suspended accounts just because they were supportive of the Duterte government,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/there-is-no-proof-twitter-suspended-accounts-just-because-they-were-supportive-of-the-duterte-government/,"A Washington Post article has caused a stir among Filipino Netizens recently after it claimed popular social networking site Twitter suspended accounts “defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic”.
When I saw the article making the rounds, the first thing I thought was that it was quite suspect that a foreign media owned company would write about harmless activities of Filipinos online. Then when I read it, my suspicion was confirmed. The article was written by a Filipino, so-called “journalist” Regine Cabato who works for the Washington Post and yet another one of those “media practitioners” who could not separate her partisan sentiment from her work. The article was badly-written and had too many logical holes. It was obvious the writer was just trying to piece together her own biases about separate unrelated events and then came to her own conclusion that Twitter decided to suspend accounts supporting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Cabato claimed that hashtags initiated by the Opposition #OustDuterte mobilised government supporters online to counter it with their own hashtags #IStandWithThePresident and #YesToABSCBNShutdown, which brought down the ranking of #OustDuterte hashtag. She also implied that accounts supportive of the government are mere “trolls”, saying they had “suspicious elements” such as “bot-like numbers on Twitter handles, few followers and new accounts”.
Her analysis fails the “So what”? test. A lot of Filipinos would be new to Twitter because, unlike Facebook, Twitter is not part of the free data scope of many Philippine telco providers. Getting charged to use it would have turned them off signing up earlier on. Besides, the character limit imposed by Twitter is something a lot of Filipinos are not used to which is why they do not find it as “useful” as Facebook.
To be honest, Cabato’s article gave me goosebumps. It made me cringe. If you read her article, which I know would be hard because it got bumped down the feedline, you would wonder how it got published on the Washington Post at all. It was total nonsense.  It wasn’t based on facts, but only on the writer’s hunch. Here’s an excerpt:
On April 1, a video report by broadcasting giant ABS-CBN on arrests among the urban poor went viral.
#OustDuterte became the top trending hashtag in the Philippines.
The next day, the hashtags #IStand With The President and #YesToABSCBNShutdown trended. The network is facing issues regarding the renewal of its franchise, and celebrities under its entertainment circle also decried the government response.
By April 3, critics responded with #ICantStandThe President. On April 4, troll-like accounts responded to #OustDuterte with #OursDuterte.
What a piece of crap, right? What kind of journalist would write something as shallow as that? Most likely a journalist who cannot think outside of the box and who is suffering from tunnel vision. Cabato appears to hate the Duterte government so much that the only thing she could write about during a pandemic is about trolls. She thinks that just because someone supports the government, one could already assume that that person is a troll. She didn’t even give any data or say how many of the accounts she claims Twitter suspended are “bot-like”. It seems as if she was just making things up.
I tried to ask her politely on Twitter how she came to the conclusion that Twitter suspended only Duterte government supporters but I did not get a response. She probably thinks I was just trolling her. That’s another problem with members of the Opposition, they are good at ignoring people who ask questions that put them on the spot.
Instead of responding, Cabato took a dig at Get Real Philippines writers and said she finds it “troubling when the people who advise our politicians’ campaigns are informed by Get Real PH instead of news organizations.”
The idea that politicians are being “informed” by GRP writers is another strange product of Cabato’s imagination. Let’s just say what she is saying is true – that politicians are paying more attention to our advice than that of members of mainstream media. That’s only because a lot of writers from news organizations like her employer do not have anything intelligent to add to the conversation. They do not present alternative solutions to solving the country’s problems. Cabato’s article is a classic example of something published by a major news organisation like Washington Post that, unfortunately, lacks substance. It was pure click-bait. It’s not surprising that savvy politicians are not taking journalists like her seriously.
Cabato is not a true professional and this is evident in how she couldn’t be bothered to take stock of points of view from both sides of the fence. She only took soundbites from Noemi Dado who is a known rabid member of the Opposition. Dado hates everything about Duterte and thinks everyone who disagrees with her are trolls. As a journalist, Cabato should have taken another point of view just to balance her article. One can be forgiven for saying Cabato was acting like a troll herself – just trying to stir controversy with her article and then ignoring demands to provide evidence of her claims.",Others
How Filipinos can fix their broken “democracy”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/how-filipinos-can-fix-their-broken-democracy/,"Perhaps rightly so, Opposition partisans in the Philippines lament the way “democracy” is working for them nowadays. They lost an entire nation in the 2016 elections that catapulted former Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte to the presidency today and botched a chance to gain a foothold into Congress when they suffered a catastrophic loss in the 2019 national elections. Indeed, it is not that big a stretch to perceive Philippine “democracy” to be quite sick when you are at its losing end.
The trouble with this thinking is that it lacks perspective. If Opposition “thought leaders” step back for a minute and regard the complete picture, they will find that Philippine democracy is working as it should be; that is, according to how the 1987 Constitution intended it to. Leaders in the executive branch and representatives in the legislature are elected by popular vote within their respective jurisdictions. Worse, the Vice President is elected separately to the President — very likely a decision made by the framers of the Constitution informed by the paranoia over a possible “return to tyranny” that marked the period following the EDSA “revolution” of 1986.
In short, the Opposition led by a rabidly partisan bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) made their own bed when they signed up to the 1987 Yellowtard Constitution. This was a charter, after all, that put a premium on popularity over qualifications. The thinking at the time is that the “will of the people”, read the majority, rules. As it turns out, this was all just a euphemism for the oxymoron on exhibit today, that popularity makes it right.
How then do you “fix” democracy, seeing that democracy is, by its very nature, a popularity-makes-it-right ideology?
This is a question that haunts today’s democrats and liberals. When the very system you championed suddenly turns you into a loser, the natural recourse is to discredit this system. That’s coming in a bit late to the party. Back in mid-2015, I had already pointed out Filipinos’ rather retarded approach to participating in the democratic process…
Coming back closer to home, to the Philippine setting, we see the way Filipinos have also retarded themselves to using democracy as a mere toy rather than a real tool for modern governance. We can see in the Philippine national “debate” in the lead-up to the 2016 national elections that there is hardly any trace of intellectual substance in the rhetoric dished out by the Philippines’ so-called “thought leaders” and opinion shapers. The candidates being evaluated all fall far short of the bar set by real statesmen of a calibre that makes real sovereigns and real national leaders. Yet the national obsession remains fixated on the three- to four-odd bozos vying for that lucrative seat in Malacanang.
Nothing much has changed. Today’s Opposition, though boasting a who’s-who of chi chi private Catholic school educated partisans, “activists”, “thought leaders”, and “media practitioners”, has contributed very little to the uplift of the national “debate”. This is hardly surprising considering that an environment in which popularity holds primary currency does not provide fertile ground for intellectual conversation to thrive. This is also the reason mainstream media community had consistently failed to contribute to building a more intelligent society. This is because its members’ business models constrain them to channeling the bulk of their investment funds and resources towards delivering the lowest common denominator content to their audience — low-brow mass entertainment.
Democracy per se cannot be fixed. What can be fixed, however, is the quality of its participants. If Filipinos want to remain a democracy, they will need to participate in its processes more intelligently. It is quite evident that the Opposition are not up to the task of leading such an initiative. They remain fixated to a bad habit of negative campaigning — seeking to tear down rather than propose compelling alternatives to move forward. And as to that other big institution that presumes to “guide” Filipino thinking, the Roman Catholic Church, well, there is something to be said about an organisation that continues to uphold doctrines that its own officials deem exempt from critical scrutiny and challenge. The Yellowtards, mainstream media, and the Roman Catholic Church — institutions that exert strong influence over Filipinos — are all inherently incapable of evolving.
Filipinos should start their long-overdue evolution into smart participants in a modern democracy by rejecting the perverted leadership of the Yellowtards, mainstream media, and the Church. We could start by embracing independent thinking and turn our backs towards the obsolete tradition of idolatry — to self-appointed “thought leaders” and heroes, to credentials of dubious substance, and to medieval robes and sceptres — that characterises today’s political discourse. Only then can we begin a march to true democratic maturity.",Others
Stopping ABS-CBN’s Franchise Renewal By Hook and By Crook,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/stopping-abs-cbns-franchise-renewal-by-hook-and-by-crook/,"This morning Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the franchises of ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc “as they are unlawfully exercising their legislative franchises.”
It would look like the final nail in the coffin of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal. That is if we consider that a number of cases lodged in the Supreme Court were decided in favor of Duterte’s allies and against his enemies.
Ordinarily, ABS-CBN would have 30 days in which to respond to the quo warranto position but, according to a reporter at the Supreme Court, this period may be shortened.
This is because it may be overtaken by the recess of Congress which happens in about two weeks and without bill renewing ABS-CBN’s franchise passing the Third and Final reading, this will spell the end for the broadcast network’s operations.
So far,  11 bills seeking ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal have yet to be calendared. Attempts to renew ABS-CBN’s franchise were similarly stalled in previous sessions of congress.
A copy of Calida’s quo warranto could not be obtained immediately by reporters at the scene of the filing of the petition. Attempts by reporters to interview Calida on the basis of the quo warranto petition were refused with the solicitor general saying that he was headed to another appointment. He however had time enough to rebuff one male reporter, accusing him of hitting him and told him that “you better just practice (law) so we can see each other in court.”
However, in what appears to be a statement issued by Solicitor General Calida published by Facebook page Bulatlat, it was said that the quo warranto petition filed sought to “…put an end to what we discovered to be highly abusive practices of ABS-CBN benefitting a greedy few at the expense of millions of loyal subscribers. These practices have gone unnoticed or were disregarded for years,”
Further on in the statement it is claimed that “…petition will show that ABS-CBN has been broadcasting for a fee, which is beyond the scope of its legislative franchise. Further, the media giant, hiding behind an ‘elaborately crafted corporate veil’ has been allowing foreign investors to take part in the ownership of a Philippine mass media entity, in gross violation of the foreign interest restriction of mass media provided under Section 11, Article XVI of the Constitution.
“ABS-CBN abused the privilege granted by the State when it launched and operated a pay-per-view channel in ABS-CBN TV Plus, the KBO Channel, without prior approval or permit from the National Telecommunications Commission.”
“Further, like Rappler, ABS-CBN had issued Philippine Deposit Receipts (PDRs) through ABS-CBN Holdings Corporations to foreigners, in violation of the foreign ownership restriction on mass media in the Constitution.”
Near the end of the statement it was said, “ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc (formerly Multi Media Telepony Inc) resorted to an ingenious corporate layering scheme in order to transfer its franchise without the necessary Congressional approval. It also failed to publicly offer any of its outstanding capital stock to any securities exchange within the Philippines within five years from the start of its operations, which is an indispensable condition in its franchise.”
In an interview on ANC, Congressman Rufus Rodriguez characterized Solicitor General’s petition as a direct assault to the freedom of the press and violated the equality as well as independence of the branches of government.
Rodriguez asserted that challenges to ABS-CBN’s franchise should be heard in Congress because it is the only branch of government given specific charge over the granting of franchises. He said he believes that the Supreme Court will deny the Solicitor General’s petition.
Rodriguez called on the leadership of the House of Representatives to start hearings on the bills filed in the Committee on Legislative Franchises and ASSERT its independence from the Executive branch of government.
All in all, it doesn’t look like ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal was NEVER going to be given a fair shot.",Others
Let us all please FACT CHECK the VERA Files “fact check” on Drilon’s dozing off incident on TV!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/let-us-all-please-fact-check-the-vera-files-fact-check-on-drilons-dozing-off-incident-on-tv/,"A recent “fact check” done by “investigative journalist” Ellen Tordesillas’s agency VERA Files — a so-called “independent fact checker” of Facebook — asserts that Senator Franklin Drilon did not doze off during an interview with CNN Philippines’ Pinky Webb on her show The Source. In their report “VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Jay Sonza, RJ Nieto help propagate wrong claim that Drilon snoozed in CNN PH interview” published the 7th March 2020, VERA Files makes the following claim:
Drilon did not fall asleep at any time during the interview.
VERA Files obtained from CNN Philippines a screen grab of the clip without the character generator (chargen) — the graphics placed on the bottom portion of videos — that shows Drilon not sleeping, but looking at the documents on the table in front of him.
The “report” included the following graphic provided by CNN Philippines to illustrate this claim.
To further lend credence to itself, the VERA Files “report” also quoted the following tweet issued by Webb on Twitter:
Here’s what happened. As I was laying the premise for my question, I saw Sen Drilon look down at the documents he had on the table. I did not see him fall asleep.
It is interesting to note that VERA Files used sources from only one side of the story — that of CNN Philippines and its contracted talent Pinky Webb. It did not even manage to secure a full unedited version of the footage and used a mere “screen grab” to “prove” that Drilon was, over the course of the brief footage, reading off documents on his desk. VERA Files had no third party to corroborate the “evidence” it presents — only itself and CNN Philippines and certain parties under its payroll. It seems VERA Files could not even be bothered to take a statement from Senator Drilon himself.
Furthermore, the footage used in this “fact check” was taken directly from the published and edited version of the interview (shown below).
It could be noted that a momentary shot of Drilon with his head down was aired. The camera then cut to Webb who was caught in the middle of a chuckle while repeating the question seemingly recognising that Drilon may indeed have been dozing off when she asked it the first time.
Do Filipinos have to take Webb’s account of what really happened? Can they trust VERA Files which lazily reports an account of the story using information provided entirely by CNN Philippines? It is almost as if VERA Files was in collusion with CNN Philippines when it issued this “fact check” report!
It is also very well-known that Ellen Tordesillas is allied closely with the Philippine Opposition which, nowadays, is effectively a coalition of communists and other “progressive” elements led by the Liberal Party of the Philippines. Tordesillas was a strong defender of former Opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes who is a convicted mutineer and renowned for being rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan.
People should put their foot down and say enough is enough with these bald insults on their intelligence. In the same way we witnessed Senator Grace Poe, despite being laden with a mountain of conflicts-of-interest, squander taxpayers’ resources and use the Senate as a theatre for ABS-CBN’s song-and-dance, we now see “fact check” agency VERA Files in collusion with another media outlet, CNN Philippines, in a similarly brazen dishonest act. Truly, Big Corporate Media lead our community of communicators in perpetrating the biggest acts of dishonesty in the business!
Step back for a moment and think about it. What makes VERA Files more correct than other people who viewed the very same video? It’s not as if VERA Files provided footage from a different camera angle or over the full length of the incident with no edits applied by CNN Philippines production personnel. It is not as if VERA Files offers any facts that are not already accessible and readily-evident to all Filipinos.
The smart way forward from here is for Filipinos to apply a bit of critical thinking when examining the facts caught on video. It’s really a personal choice, but the exercise befits the thinking faculties of modern consumers of mass media. VERA Files is, by no means, exempt from critical scrutiny.",Others
Brazen Red Tapism at the House Hearing on ABS-CBN Franchise Renewal,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/brazen-red-tapism-at-the-house-hearing-on-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal/,"With the speed that some bills and budgets got passed, it’s really a wonder why the House of Representatives under the leadership of House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano is subjecting ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise renewal to a form of red tapism.
As I pointed out in previous posts on the topic of ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise renewal, the House Committee on Legislative Franchises could have begun hearings on the 11 bills pending before since last year and avoided the “artificial” 11th hour proceedings that we saw this afternoon.
And what did we witness this afternoon?
We saw our congressmen deliberating over committee rules as if THIS were the first time that the House Committee on Legislative Franchises were tackling the granting of the very first ever TV network legislative franchise.
Even more jarring was the motion to divide participating congressmen in the hearing into those opposed to ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal and those for it.
Deputy Speaker South Cotabato Representative Ferdinand L. Hernandez’ interjection in the midst of the bickering over the minutiae of House Rules seemed to settle the discussion in favor of the more established minority-majortity-independent grouping of congressman participants in the hearing.
Hernandez was right in reminding the more polarized members of the House of Representatives that not all members of the house had chosen a side on the issue.
In fact, because the House Committee on Legislative Franchise Chairman’s move to bar sponsorship speeches of those for the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise, in my opinion deprived everyone of a chance to hear the merits of proposed franchise renewal.
Perhaps because I am more tuned in to the social media feeds of avid supporters of the Duterte Administration, I am more aware of the allegations against ABS-CBN and the reasons for not renewing their legislative franchise.
From where I am, I would have liked to have heard the proponents of ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise renewal at the very start of the hearing.
In fact, this would have helped the House of Representatives do away with the image it is building up as the stamp pad for the Executive Branch.
The thing that worries me about what transpired at the House hearing on ABS-CBN today was the proposal for an open ended provisional authority to operate from the NTC.
If one wanted to keep ABS-CBN on a short leash, such a provisional authority would not only be a short leash but a choker and muzzle.
With no clear rules and procedures on the administration of this provisional authority from the NTC, this may be giving the body a carte blanche and who knows what reason or unreason could lead to the closure of ABS-CBN.
In such a situation, it might as well be a form of censorship and in that vein, further legitimizes the view of a case of a curtailment of the freedom of the press.
If the biggest broadcast network can be made to kneel and kowtow to the government, I doubt lesser broadcast networks and media companies can resist.
If press freedom is only for those voices that pleases the ears of the powers that be, then we have surely lost it and never deserved it in the first place.",Others
Reporters Without Borders Lists Duterte Admin As Press Freedom Digital Predator,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/reporters-without-borders-lists-duterte-admin-as-press-freedom-digital-predator/,"I do not necessarily agree with Reporters Without Borders listing of the Philippine government or the Duterte Administration as a press freedom digital predator because of the opposition faced by ABS-CBN’s efforts to renew its legislative franchise.
In fact, I continue to be skeptical of foreign “press organizations” that continue to publish reports and ratings of press freedom in the Philippines based on news reports or even assessments from their associates here in the Philippines.
Human Rights Watch, for example, is an organization I encountered during my work with President Duterte’s Presidential Task Force on Media Security which aided in the pursuit of conviction of those who perpetrated the Maguindanao Massacre. In a number of instances, Human Right Watch’s Caloy Conde was caught several times basing his reports to the foreign press organizations on news reports which he did not himself validate. In a number of instances, his tally of supposed government sanctioned killings were erroneous as it included homicide cases unrelated to the government’s anti illegal drugs drive.
In my mind, I tend to lump organizations like Reporters Without Borders (RSF) with organizations such as Human Rights Watch and others.
It doesn’t help that in its 2020 list of 20 Press Freedom Digital Predators, it makes a bare claim that “call center hubs” are being used in “Disseminating fake or maliciously edited content, and fake memes, conducting targeted harassment campaigns“.
Even more disconcerting is RSF’s claim that “President Duterte’s supporters have launched a campaign to smear and boycott the ABS-CBN radio and TV network with the aim of blocking the renewal of its licence. They have even gone so far as to denounce an imaginary conspiracy by various media outlets to overthrow the president. Cyber-troll armies, which have become big business ever since Duterte’s 2016 election campaign, support and amplify the messages of members of the government with the aim of smearing the media and manipulating public opinion.”
That’s a rather ham-fisted way of going about using RSF in ABS-CBN’s fight to renew its legislative franchise. It’s just too damned lazy.
If I were to read more into RSF’s allegation of call centers being brought to bear against ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal efforts, I would think it would be saying that government resources were being used for a propaganda war against a legitimate privately owned media organization.
That would, in fact, be saying that a privately owned media organization was being illegally penalized  by government using public funds to employ criminal means that would amount to libel.
If RSF were to go about using rigorous and legitimate means to expose what looks like government funded thuggery, it would have to use its Filipino associates to dig into the executive branch’s budget allocations for intelligence as well as communications to find proof that actual call centers or its equivalent in a government set up is being deployed against ABS-CBN.
That would be nearly impossible in the case of intelligence funds but not so for government agencies with hefty communications budgets.
To unmask such an operation, it could use a program to mine and map publicly searchable posts on social media and links on search engines for clues leading to their source or sources.
Eventually, this could lead to identifying social media accounts and websites. But even then, these social media accounts and websites may still be virtually anonymous.
Then again, with persistent sleuthing and perhaps given the enormity of such an operation, there’s bound to be a trip up somewhere.
It could be one or several call center agent coming out into the open to admit to such an operation being perpetrated against ABS-CBN and showing clear evidence of such.
But, until then, this call center theory is another one of those conspiracy theories.
I still maintain though that the overt, rather than covert, means of keeping ABS-CBN from getting its legislative franchise renewed is the one at play here.
On the judicial front, some see the hand of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco — whose son Cong. Lord Allan Velasco is supposedly in a term sharing agreement with current House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.
On the legislative front, we see the hand of House Speaker Cayetano who was reported to have admitted to stalling deliberations on bills proposing the grant of ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise.

"A Tale of Three Viruses: How Smallpox, the 1918 ‘Spanish’ Flu, and COVID-19 Changed the World",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/a-tale-of-three-viruses-how-smallpox-the-1918-spanish-flu-and-covid-19-changed-the-world/,"The history of human civilization is riddled with course-changing epochs in world history related to the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. I learned that important concept in evolutionary medicine when I studied evolutionary biology as a graduate student. Not only did we study the history of evolutionary theory, evidence for evolution, the origin of life, the origins of animals and the Cambrian explosion, genetic evolution, molecular phylogeny versus morphological phylogeny, genetic evolution, natural selection vs sexual selection, microevolution vs macroevolution, species and speciation, and human evolution but we also explored some of the most important evolutionary issues in modern medicine. We learned how medicine is, in fact a form of applied evolution, and the vulnerabilities of human body from an evolutionary perspective, considering disorders ranging from cancer, autoimmune disorders and allergies. We also explored how quickly pathogenic microorganisms can replicate inside and how they can be transmitted from one host to another by studying the evolution of virulence such as the ever-evolving seasonal flu that rapidly evolves each year, and processes such as viral reassortment that give rise to new genotypes. Such is the case with the 1918-1919 influenza that killed at least 50 million people worldwide. Evolutionary biology helps explain why it was so virulent and how scientists can prepare for new pandemics. As people became very mobile, their pathogenic microorganisms have gone along for a ride. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond leaves space for the microbes that swept the Aztec empire at the beginning of the 16th century in his seminal book, Guns, Germs, and Steel:
The importance of lethal microbes in human history is well illustrated by Europeans’ conquest and depopulation of the New World. Far more Native Americans died in bed from Eurasian germs than on the battlefield from European guns and swords. Those germs undermined Indian resistance by killing most Indians and their leaders and by sapping the survivors’ morale. For instance, in 1519 Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with 600 Spaniards, to conquer the fiercely militaristic Aztec Empire with a population of many millions… What gave the Spaniards a decisive military advantage was smallpox, which reached Mexico in 1520 with one infected slave arriving from Spanish Cuba. The resulting epidemic proceeded to kill nearly half of the Aztecs, including Emperor Cuitláhuac. Aztec survivors were demoralized by the mysterious illness that killed Indians and spared Spaniards, as if advertising Spaniards’ invincibility. By 1618, Mexico’s initial population of about 20 million had plummeted to about 1.6 million people.
Mr. Diamond also makes a compelling case for the powerful influence of geography and environment in world history. According to him, many discoveries and scientific breakthroughs helped transform kingdoms in western Europe into empires that spanned the globe at the beginning of the 16th century. Some Europeans ventured to distant countries to spread their faith or gain religious freedom, but most went in search for metals and other commodities that would enrich their lives and the monarchs they served. Conquistadores from Spain who ventured to the New World made Spain the world’s largest and richest empire in the 16th century. He also explained that, when conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro arrived in the New World, they brought with them new diseases such as measles and smallpox that were deadlier than their weapons. Their movements have brought diseases to people who were never exposed to them before. In some cases, the encounter has been devastating (Diamond, 1997).
We also learned in our class that, for many centuries, these devastating pathogenic microorganisms and their human hosts in Europe had been in a coevolutionary arms race. As a result, Europeans had some resistance to the disease. But when these pathogens arrived in the New World, they began to infect human populations whose immune systems had not been part of the arms race. Native Americans had no acquired immunity to diseases colonizers introduced, and no horses, firearms, or swords to thwart the invaders. The impact of Europeans on the natives was devastating. They wiped out an estimated 90 percent of the residents of North and South America in the first few decades after first contact with Europeans. If not for the coevolution of humans and pathogens, world history would have taken a different path.
The Perfect Storm
Four hundred years after Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico and brought their pathogens for the ride, another virus killed more people than any outbreak of disease in human history that originated from Haskell County, an isolated and sparsely populated county in Kansas, USA. In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond’s 2005 sequel to Guns, Germs, and Steel, he explores several cases to explain the complex interplay of different factors that affect historical outcomes, including environment and government policies, the role of the mass media and intelligentsia, political leadership, etc. The unprecedented fury of the First World War that convulsed the world is an eloquent example of Mr. Diamond’s broader approach to his wide-ranging research.
Every history buff knows that the First World War originated in the Balkans, where the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, a 19-year-old Serbian nationalist, caused conflict between Austria-Hungary and Russia, two troubled empire with powerful allies. The conflict pitted the Central Powers against the Allied Powers. When war broke out in 1914, Americans opposed the involvement of US troops, and President Woodrow Wilson declared the country’s neutrality. Whether the sinking of the passenger ship SS Lusitania or the interception of the United States of the “Zimmerman Note” had triggered a cascade of events that led to the United States to join the war, the Congress and President Wilson had to mobilize quickly to rally the soldiers and the citizens behind their war effort with the help of the mass media and the intelligentsia.
In Media Control –The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda, Noam Chomsky explained that the Wilson administration had to do something about it. When they established the Creel Commission (named after the former Denver Post columnist George Creel, a muckraker who spearheaded the first modern-day propaganda of the Wilson administration) in 1917, he was able to “turn a pacifist population into a war-mongering population.” Among those who participated actively and enthusiastically, Chomsky continues, were the progressive intellectuals, people of the John Dewey circle, who took great pride in having shown that what they called “more intelligent members of the community” namely themselves, were able to drive a reluctant population into a war by terrifying them and eliciting jingoist fanaticism. In Intellectuals and Society, Thomas Sowell describes the propaganda techniques used by these members of the intelligentsia. He contends that the Committee on Public Information, aptly described as “the West’s first modern ministry of propaganda” was created and run by Progressive George Creel, who took it as his mission to turn public opinion into “one white-hot mass” of support for the war, in the name of “100% Americanism,“ with anyone who “refuses to back the President in this crisis” being branded “worse than a traitor.” And, he continues, “while the public was being propagandized on a mass scale – by tens of millions of pamphlets and with ‘war studies’ created in high school and colleges, for example – a Sedition Act was passed which forbade ‘uttering, writing, printing, or publishing any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the United States government and the military.’”
These factors as well as the unprecedented world travel enabled the explosion and created a perfect storm scenario that enabled the spread of a deadly influenza strain.
How did the flu from Kansas spread across the world?
The “Spanish flu” of 1918-1919, which caused tens of million deaths worldwide, is a misnomer because the outbreak had originated in the United States during World War 1. Countries involved during World War 1 suppressed their press and withheld information from their citizens except Spain. When their king, Alphonse X111, fell ill because of the flu, the pandemic that swept across the world became known as the ‘Spanish Flu.’ However, different epidemiological studies have identified Camp Funston in Kansas as the origin of the influenza outbreak. As the story goes, sometime in 1918, a prominent doctor named Loring Miner started observing an especially severe flu that cropped up among his patients in rural Haskell County, Kansas (Barry, 2005). Miner had seen influenza before, and he knew it well, but this was different and he was shocked by what he saw (Zimmer, 2013):
This virus ravaged his patient’s bodies fast, and it killed, sometimes within a single day. An unusually virulent strain had evolved and begun to spread within the local community. Normally, this kind of outbreak would not get far before disappearing. By killing its hosts too fast, it should have driven itself extinct. But his particular virulent strain did not die out. That’s because America was going to war. The same week that Loring Minor’s patients fell ill, two recruits named Ernest Elliott and Dean Nilson took the train Haskell County to Camp Funston, the second largest training camp in the country. Within a month, thousands of soldiers were hospitalized with the flu and thousands more were treated at infirmaries throughout the base. All the while, troops were being shipped between camps, and from the camps to the European front. Two weeks after that, influenza outbreaks hit other training camps. By that point, the virus had spread with American troops to the trenches; from there it swept across Europe and then China, to New Zealand and Australia, and back again to the United States. As many as 100 million people would die before the 1918 flu pandemic came to an end.
But how did this strain evolve to be so deadly? Wartime conditions changed the nature of selection acting on the influenza virus, permitting the evolution and spread of an extraordinarily deadly strain. Because it was wartime, troops were moving on overcrowded ships to filthy battlefields. Furthermore, President Woodrow Wilson strictly enforced the newly enacted “Sedition Act” that prohibited any news considered “unfavorable to the war effort of the US government and the military.” Normally victims of an epidemic become bedridden in hospitals or home. As a result, they make relatively little contact with healthy people. But at the end of World War 1, wounded soldiers were being put on trains and ships, where they could infect other bedridden hosts (Zimmer, 2013). The viruses could replicate faster because they didn’t have to travel far to infect someone else. If not for the participation of the United States in World War I, the virus would not evolve and become more virulent and the world history would have taken a different path.
How the COVID-19 fares against the world’s deadliest pandemics in history
Too many political pundits, social media influencers, TV host analysts, pseudo- intellectual obscurantists, journalists and modern-day Cassandras surrender to the cognitive bias of assessing the world through memes, anecdotes and images rather than statistical analysis, data and facts when it comes to disseminating information about the COVID-19. The contagion of fear and panic they spread is more virulent that the contagion of virus itself. Fortunately, the virus turned out not to be like the 1918 pandemic because it was relatively mild in terms of virulence and fatality rate. Still, that was little comfort to the families of the estimated 278,000 people (as of March 21, 2020) who have contracted the virus and at least 11,570 who died of the strain, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. However, one of the characteristics of viruses is its ability to mutate at a high rate and change the nature of selection, permitting the evolution and spread of an extraordinarily deadly strain from human to human.
For example, subsequent pandemics have evolved every few decades after the reassortment (blending) of the 1918 flu virus such as the “Asian flu” of 1957-58 that killed 1.5 million people and the “Hongkong flu” of 1968-69 that killed 1 million people. These strains continue to circulate today but cause less mortality because human populations have developed immunity to them.
Nowadays, hundreds of thousands of people die each year in the United States alone from influenza but they don’t make worldwide headlines and create worldwide panic. However, the worldwide pandemic we have to worry more about and what experts really are afraid of is a new strain of flu that the human population has not been exposed to before, one that virtually everyone will not have any immunity against—one that scientists believe is worse than the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed tens of millions worldwide. Scientists recently discovered a triple assortant that mixed genes from classic swine flu with genes from bird viruses and human viruses. From our class, we also learned that even the most optimistic scenarios for how the next worldwide flu epidemic (pandemic) might proceed are grim. Experts believe that reassorted influenza virus can affect 20% of the world’s population, with close to 30 million people needing hospitalization, a quarter of whom will die. Pandemics result when a virus to which most people have no immunity, usually an avian strain, acquires the ability to transmit readily from animal to person, and then from person to person. This can happen by the virus mutating so that it can be passed between people, or it could exchange genes with a common human flu strain.
Case in point: In 2002, a mysterious new disease began to spread through China. At first, a Chinese farmer came to a hospital suffering from a high fever and died soon afterward. Other people from the same region of China began to develop the disease as well but didn’t reach the world’s attention until an American businessman flying back from China fell ill on a flight to Singapore and eventually died in Hanoi, Vietnam. The disease was given a new name: SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome (Zimmer, 2013). The outbreak of SARS almost triggered a global recession. Fear of the virus caused serious financial damage to businesses. During the height of SARS, nobody was going to restaurants and people didn’t want to go shopping. Estimates of economic impact ranged from $40 billion or so. If you’re looking for the economic impact of the current global pandemic, you’re looking at an impact measured in the trillions of dollars.  Experts now believe that the odds of a global recession are more likely to happen than it was a month or two ago when the COVID-19 swept across the world. What is scarier is that experts in epidemiology, public health and evolutionary biology had been warning us about a global pandemic for years and we paid a high price for not listening and heeding their advice.

Washington Post “report” by Regine Cabato claiming Twitter suspended pro-Duterte accounts is MISLEADING,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/washington-post-report-by-regine-cabato-claiming-twitter-suspended-pro-duterte-accounts-is-misleading/,"A Washington Post article authored by Philippine correspondent Regine Cabato claiming that “Twitter suspends accounts defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic” seems to have been either taken down or has since been buried. The article was widely shared over social media yesterday. Opposition “thought leader” and self-described “social media expert” Noemi Dado, in a tweet on the 9th of April, shared screenshots of the report text together with what seems to be a link to the original page where the article was posted. However, clicking on the link just leads to a generic list of Post articles related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The article quoted Dado as a reference to support the assertion that pro-administration “trolls” were behind a campaign to “trend” hashtags like “#IstandWithDuterte” which Opposition partisans and Cabato claim were part of an “orchestrated” campaign “defending the response of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s government to the coronavirus pandemic”.
“Trolls [and] supporters are mostly reactive to the organic display of criticism,” said Noemi Dado, a blogger and member of the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation. “Duterte is supposed to have a high satisfaction rating… so the trolls must make it look like Duterte is loved.”
In the same seemingly-missing Washington Post “report”, Cabato also claims, “[since] Duterte was elected president in 2016, online political support in the Philippines has been largely manufactured. Politicians, through public relations strategists, tap ‘trolls’ to create multiple accounts to foster an illusion of support and sway public opinion”.
We reached out to Noemi Dado for comment but had not heard from her as of this writing.
GMA News Online also ran the story on Regine Cabato’s mysterious “report”. They report, however, that, beyond the Washington Post, there seems to be no other source to verify whether or not all that Cabato writes and Dado claims is actually true.
Sought for confirmation and comment, Twitter said it was the Washington Post which first reached out and there was nothing further it could share on record.
For her part, Cabato also took to Twitter to defend herself and her so-called “report” insisting that the article remains online and quotes the same misleading link Dado shared earlier. According to Cabato, the “report” is “part of a live feed, short dispatches on COVID worldwide, which is why you have to scroll down and why it’s not on my byline page.”
Twitter, like most social media sites, attests to its precise moderation guidelines that are, for the most part, agnostic to users’ partisan loyalties. As such, there is evidently no basis in Cabato’s claims that the accounts in question were suspended because they were “defending Philippine government response to coronavirus pandemic”. To suggest so is, therefore, misleading and does not help the already embattled “journalism” profession which increasingly struggles for relevance and suffers an acute crisis of credibility.",Others
Senator Grace Poe should RESIGN following the ABS-CBN conflict-of-interest fiasco!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/senator-grace-poe-should-resign-following-the-abs-cbn-conflict-of-interest-fiasco/,"Pressure is mounting on Senator Grace Poe to hold herself accountable for misappropriating public resources down a Senate “inquiry” into the ABS-CBN franchise renewal “issue”. The “inquiry” which Poe claimed was “in aid of legislation” has done nothing beyond giving ABS-CBN a platform for emotional blackmail. Poe is hard-pressed to report to the Filipino public what lessons were learned from the “inquiry” that could be applied to aid legislation.
Thus far, what did come out of this circus is working against Poe. Laid bare thus far is how much money her family is making off the cozy relationship her family estate enjoys with Big Corporate ABS-CBN. A recent eye-opening exposé into the Poe family’s financial interests in ABS-CBN (and vice versa) authored by former Ambassador Bobi Tiglao featured in the Manila Times details just how lucrative this relationship is. It starts with Poe’s mother, Susan Roces (widow of her late father Fernando ‘FPJ’ Poe Jr), currently being a major contracted talent of ABS-CBN…
Her mother plays the role of a main character (Flora “Lola Kap”) in ABS-CBN’s hugely successful drama “Ang Probinsiyano,” which has been running for over four years, with about 1,136 episodes. Lola Kap is a village captain and the sagacious grandmother of the series’ hero Cardo (played by Coco Martin), who imparts life lessons in most every episode.
Assuming that Roces gets a very conservative P200,000 per episode, that means income for her of over P230 million so far from that ABS-CBN production. That’s a fair estimate, considering that lead actor Martin is known to have become a billionaire from his earnings from “Ang Probinsyano.”
Tiglao goes further to cite how the estate of FPJ — presumably under his surviving heirs’ management — very likely earns royalties from every commercial use of its intellectual assets; for example, everytime an FPJ movie is streamed via ABS-CBN’s extensive portfolio of global content distribution channels.
Thus the obvious next step, taking her up on her claim that this “inquiry” was done “in aid of legislation”, is for Poe to spell out what the next steps are. That is in assuming, of course, that Poe had thought things through that far ahead when she initiated this “inquiry”. By the way she and members of the Opposition had been giving one another mutual high-fives in the couple of days following the ABS-CBN “inquiry”, it seems that no such next steps were even thought about to begin with. Indeed, they are celebrating the dishonest outcome — the award-winning theatrics of ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak during the “inquiry” and his subsequent elevation to idol status by his newly-acquired fandom — as an end of itself.
This astounding use of public resources in the service of a private enterprise — the business interests of ABS-CBN — is a a clear case of plunder. Senator Grace Poe better give the Filipino public a good reason why she should not be charged for that crime. The first step in the right direction is to demonstrate that this exercise will lead to new legislation to improve corporate regulation in the Philippines. Failing this, it then becomes clearly evident that Poe lied about her stated intention — that this exercise was “in aid of legislation” — when she initiated this “inquiry”.",Others
Why is the media giving Vico Sotto more than his fair share of exposure?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/why-is-the-media-giving-vico-sotto-more-than-his-fair-share-of-exposure/,"It’s likely because Vico Sotto, Mayor of Pasig City is the son of showbiz personalities. His mother is Coney Reyes Mumar, former co-host of hit noontime TV variety show Student Canteen. His father is mega-star Vic Sotto, brother to Senate President Tito Sotto and a member of the huge comedy trio act Tito Vic and Joey. The Sottos are amongst the most powerful families in Philippine showbiz.
The COVID-19 outbreak seems to be proving to be a media mileage bonanza for Sotto whose “for the people” rhetoric is attracting adulation from a bevy of Opposition “thought leaders” who are quick to exploit Sotto’s telegenic looks to fashion him into a poster boy of everything Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is not. Sotto is evidently benefiting from both his family ties and the connections key Opposition leaders cultivate with Big Corporate Media businesses in the Philippines.
The Vico Sotto Media Project follows a recent scandal surrounding a similar conflict-of-interest of family fortunes intertwined with news media businesses covering scions of powerful showbiz clans. Just a month or two back, Senator Grace Poe was called out for using the Senate as a grandstand for an emotional appeal campaign being mounted by the Lopez media empire, ABS-CBN. This stunt, unfortunately for Poe, only served to bring to the fore her and her family’s financial ties with the Philippines’ biggest media network.
These cases bring to light the fundamental problem with the notion that Corporate Media is a reliable purveyor of “news”. These connections and family ties notwithstanding, Sotto is good business as far as “news reporting” goes as he attracts viewers that, in turn, translates to ad revenue. In short, the system is rigged to favour the telegenic, the well connected, and, more importantly, the Opposition choice.
In short, it is a dishonest business that claims to be a disinterested observer of a subject that is a part of its business network. It is also the dishonest politician who makes his job about himself and not about the people he is mandated to serve.",Others
Speaker Cayetano Holds Hostage the Livelihood of Thousands of ABS-CBN Employees,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/speaker-cayetano-holds-hostage-the-livelihood-of-thousands-of-abs-cbn-employees/,"One of the House Speaker’s duties is to make sure that important political and economic legislation is passed in an efficient and timely matter.
House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano prides himself for having passed the 2020 budget in record time but not without detractors alleging that he had favored allies with hundreds of millions.
Fellow political observers looking at the behavior of some congressmen say that they saw quite remarkable changes which they say could indicate that vast sums of money changed hands.
One of which was prominent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ally Mike Defensor coming out in a prominent news article saying that House Speaker Cayetano should remain as House Speaker and renege on his term sharing agreement with congressman Lord Allan Velasco. This sticks out as an odd thing for Defensor to do, considering the hate-hate relationship Arroyo and Cayetano had.
If that’s strange, you’ll get your socks blown off when I tell you that a former government functionary says he’d even go to the extent of buying and planting kilos of illegal drugs right on the doorstep of Velasco so that he doesn’t get a chance of taking over as House Speaker.
But even as tons of cash giving people at the House of Representatives a giddy high, thousands of ABS-CBN’s employees and stakeholders have to do with weeks of restless sleep.
This is chiefly because their fate remains uncertain as the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise hasn’t been acted upon by Cayetano and the House Committee on Legislative Franchise chaired by Cong. Chicoy Alvarez.
The word I get is that not a single hearing has been called for the 10 or so resolutions for the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise filed by various other congressmen last year.
Seeing this situation, a fellow political observer said, “When it comes to shovelling millions into their pockets, Cawatano (referring to Cayetano) and his gang are blindingly fast. But when it comes to ensuring the livelihood of thousands of workers, they’re excruciatingly slow and quick to pass the buck.”
The political observer says that Cayetano and House Legislative Franchise committee chairman Alvarez keeps saying that he can’t act on the resolutions filed before his committee without a go signal from “upstairs” — referring to Malacanang.
Malacanang on the other hand says it is up to Congress to decide on ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal.
And while this buck passing happens between the House of Representatives and Malacanang, the calendar dates move onward and there are now just 17 days to go before the end of the 18th congress’ first regular session.
Another political observer speculates that Cayetano and his gang are sitting on ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal because they’re waiting for a higher money offer from the Lopezes.
Could Cayetano be such a depraved political entrepreneur that he’s willing to risk the livelihood of thousands just so he can get his hands on more money?",Others
Emotional testimonials from fans won’t change FACTS nor help ABS-CBN in court,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/emotional-testimonials-from-fans-wont-change-facts-nor-help-abs-cbn-in-court/,"Pro ABS-CBN activists need to come up with better arguments to support their favourite mass media network. Notice how ABS-CBN supporters are making narratives out of how they and their families here and abroad are so attached to their favourite shows from the network and how it has helped them cope with life? That’s all nothing but lame emotional blackmail. They don’t address the legal issues against the owners and the hard facts surrounding the case.
At the moment, ABS-CBN is joined by partisans in collecting testimonials from patrons of their products here and abroad. They cite how the network helps them “cope” with life and homesickness. This is the all-too-familiar tactic that keeps jeepneys operating with impunity and squatters occupying land illegally in the Philippines. It has nothing to do with quality and purpose and is just another one of those non sequitur platitudes that lazy and unoriginal “activists” use habitually.
ABS-CBN supporters do not understand that the owners of the TV network have to win the battle to renew its franchise to operate in court and not on social media. This means they have to use facts and not emo arguments. They can’t tell the judge “my relatives abroad love TFC” and expect to win this one.
The network owners should also consider the sorts of activists they are in bed with. For example, they should ask themselves: Are we associated with a partisan bloc that has “loser” written all over their faces? If so, how do we expect to get the majority of the public behind us?
No wonder the Oppostion always lose whatever they are fighting for. The public is tired of seeing and hearing from a small clique of shrill voices. They are overexposed and they talk nonsense. If these people plan to win ABS-CBN’s case using the Court of Public Opinion (rather than the Court of Real Facts and Logic) they should consider how popular their postergirls are.
Don’t get me wrong. It’s not their physical appearance that’s the problem, it’s the fact that they often post smiley photos. It’s hard to take them seriously — just like how it is hard to take seriously the way “vice president” Leni Robredo is always grinning even when she in a disaster zone. They look unaffected by the issues they flight for.
One wonders why these people continue to smile when, as Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao points out…
Is it so difficult for them to read and understand documents available to everyone, that ABS-CBN betrayed the country when it sold in 2013, about 22 percent of its effective shares — through the flimsy disguise of Philippine Depository Shares — to foreigners, 18 percent to the United States-based The Capital Group, one of the biggest investment companies in the world?
The fact is, media companies are required to  be 100% owned by Filipinos. Foreign investors are allowed to own 40% of other businesses. The fact that ABS-CBN exerts such a powerful influence over Filipinos and is subject to foreign and private business influence by themselves should be cause for concern.
More important, Filipinos also need to take stock of what ABS-CBN have so far contributed to the quality of Filipinos’ intellectual and cultural lives. They should evaluate this contribution (if any) beyond the empty emotional highs they get out of watching telenovelas, noon time variety shows, adolescent “love teams”, and trashy showbiz gossip. If we are to be serious about our desire to change television programming, we should start with calling for shows that engage the intellect. Chat shows that talk about people and their love life rather than explore ideas of substance should be purged from local television.
It is high time that television be used as a medium to transform the lives of the marginalized portion of Philippine society rather than dumb it down further. TV networks need to develop shows that promote entrepreneurship and skill development. They should create original programs and not just produce mediocre knock offs of western and Korean entertainment products.
Big mass media networks like ABS-CBN can change people’s lives. One can only hope that their powerful executives can find it in their hearts to change the course of the plot so the Filipino people can look forward to a happier ending. Key to this is in thinking about whether ABS-CBN is up to the task of helping make Filipinos a smarter people and not just make money off giving them empty emotional highs.",Others
Supporters of ABS-CBN represent the interests of the oligarchy and NOT of the Filipino people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/supporters-of-abs-cbn-represent-the-interests-of-the-oligarchy-and-not-of-the-filipino-people/,"Supporters of embattled ABS-CBN are going about their expressions of “solidarity” with the media giant the wrong way. They are framing their “cause” as one about its employees losing their jobs because of an “attack” from an “evil dictator”.
The facts, however, tell a different story. The case being built by the government against ABS-CBN makes use of legal arguments. The administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte represented by the Solicitor General’s Office (SGO) is doing things by the book. And, ultimately, the fate of ABS-CBN is in the hands of representatives in Congress — people who won an election for the privilege of representing the Filipino people’s interests.
Supporters of ABS-CBN, on the other hand, have the interests of Filipinos at the bottom of their list of priorities. At the top of their priorities are the interests of the network’s shareholders, its thousand-odd employees, and that of a channel that has a long track record of dishonest “news reporting” biased towards their partisan agenda. More importantly, the manner with which they are pressing their demands involves calls to action that lie outside the frame of the law.
ABS-CBN supporters, rather than argue the case before the government are, instead, waging a propaganda campaign to demonise it. This is, in essence, a campaign to get what they want using tactics no better than a child throwing a temper tantrum.
The notions that there is some sort of “fight” to be had and that “press freedom” is “under attack” have long been discredited and are ideas irrevocably perverted by extreme partisanism. You’d think the Opposition would have learnt this important lesson by now — that the Laban (“fight”) rhetoric and the idea of press freedom “under threat” are kisses of death on their chances of winning an election in the near future. Filipinos regard these manufactured issues with eyes rolled up to the sky at best.
One of the pillars of the ABS-CBN persuasion campaign is appeal to emotion and its darker tool, emotional blackmail. Because ABS-CBN makes most of its money off low-brow entertainment, it has ample “talent” to propagate this mind poison with the likes of celebrities like “DJ Chacha”, for example, marching to that tune.
Hindi alam ni sist ang salitang empathy. Hay. https://t.co/GrlUY9IPUN
— DJ Chacha (@_djchacha) February 21, 2020
Appeals to emotion, of course, don’t win cases in court. To be fair, they move political bodies such as Congress and win political exercises such as elections. However, the 2019 elections that saw the key Opposition coalition suffering a catastrophic loss proved that they are woefully ineffective at that game. It is indeed baffling that they continue to expect different results while doing the same thing over and over again.
The kiddies populating the lame protest rallies organised by the Opposition’s top “thought leaders” should pause and observe as the grownups take charge of resolving ABS-CBN’s problems. Already, authorised officials of the firm are issuing less inflammatory statements and reaching out to the right people and work within the system to sort this mess out. This is how things are done in a mature society — where due process is observed and intelligent conversation is carried on. There is less room for the hysterics of a discredited “activist” clique and lots of opportunity in adult conduct. It’s time Filipinos and their politics grow up — for the sake of ABS-CBN and others like it that run afoul of the law.",Others
Karen Davila failed to pin blame for ABS-CBN franchise non-renewal on Duterte during Panelo interview,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/karen-davila-failed-to-pin-blame-for-abs-cbn-franchise-non-renewal-on-duterte-during-panelo-interview/,"ABS-CBN news and talk show host Karen Davila recently had Malacanang Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo as her guest on ANC to discuss the franchise renewal of the TV network that employs her. It’s fair to say that she struggled to achieve her goal — to pin the blame on President Rodrigo Duterte over the possibility that the network could be shut down when its franchise to use their allocated public radio frequency doesn’t get renewed before it expires on the 30th March 2020.
Davila at one point asked Panelo why Congress doesn’t want to hear or tackle ABS-CBN’s franchise issue even though Duterte already said that Congress should tackle it. Panelo said “I don’t know. You should ask them”. Davila seemed baffled as to why the Speaker of the House of Representative doesn’t take the cue from the President. But, to that, Panelo also expressed bafflement as to why Congress has to wait for the President’s cue before it does its job. Less than five minutes into the program, it was already obvious the questions Davila would be throwing at Panelo were going to be silly and repetitive.
No offense to Davila, but the irony in her arguments seems to fly over her head. First, she implies that Duterte is dictating his wishes on Congress, then she answers her own question with a question: “Why is Congress not tackling the franchise issue?”
Panelo tried his best to explain to Davila that ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal to operate is in the hands of Congress and not in the President’s. It was clear that Davila either (1) had an agenda to blame the hold up on Duterte or (2) just couldn’t get the concept of separation of functions of the three independent branches of government. Either way, the interview was definitely not going her way at this point.
Davila soldiered on nonetheless and tried to paint the non-renewal as an attack on press freedom but when asked by Panelo why she believed it so, she couldn’t explain herself. Panelo reminded her that there are other networks that are still free to operate and deliver the news. Members of mainstream media keep insisting that Duterte is trying to stifle dissent while they continue to criticise him without consequences. They can’t see why their credibility is suffering as a result of inconsistencies like these.
The President may have his own beef with the owners, but that is a separate issue. To be sure, it is a fact that ABS-CBN got on Duterte’s bad side when the network failed to air P2 million worth of regional campaign ads when he was still campaigning for the Presidency. Panelo stressed that the President wants to shut down the network’s fraudulent practices such as those.
Panelo then mentioned the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against ABS-CBN, which the network also violated. A quick Google search would show that then Vice Presidential candidate Alan Peter Cayetano who is the current Speaker of the House sought the TRO a day after ABS-CBN began airing the anti-Duterte ad paid for by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, which showed clips of Duterte cursing, uttering his controversial rape remark, and saying he is ready to kill. In between these clips, various children were shown criticizing Duterte for his behavior. Panelo asserted that it was, in fact, Duterte who is a victim of ABS-CBN’s dishonest activities.
The problem with ABS-CBN owners is that they were blatant with their partisan politics and weren’t wise enough to get on Duterte’s good side even after he won the Presidency. This is a hard lesson for ABS-CBN. One has to make sure one has her affairs in order before pissing off someone powerful. Otherwise, they are toast. ABS-CBN learned this the hard way when the Solicitor General did his due diligence and decided to run a fine-toothed comb through its affairs.
According to the Quo Warranto filed by Solicitor General Jose Calida to the Supreme Court, the owners allegedly violated the law specifically with their unlawful use of frequencies reserved for free-to-air broadcasting and allowing illegal foreign investment in their business.
Unlawful use of frequencies reserved for free-to-air broadcasting
ABS-CBN is accused of charging fees to users accessing content using radio frequencies reserved for broadcasting free-to-air content “in free and unencrypted form requiring no subscription, other than on-going cost or reception fee.” Section 77 of the document lists instances where ABS-CBN used these frequencies to broadcast pay-per-view content. Counted among these broadcasts are various boxing matches, the 2019 ABS-CBN Ball, and others all accessible for fees collected by ABS-CBN. It is reiterated in Section 84 that “ABS-CBN Corporation has no lawful authority to utilize the free-to-air signals to collect fees from the viewing public…”
Illegal foreign ownership
Issuance of Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) to foreign entities, even by ABS Holdings which, some argue, is an entity apart and different to ABS-CBN Corporation, constitutes an act that, “for all intents and purposes allowed foreigners to influence and participate in the mass media enterorise of the Philippines…” The petitioner charges, as such, that, according to Section 141…
ABS Holding’ issuance of PDRs to non-Filipino citizens is a scheme employed making it appear that the share remain with the Filipino corporation while granting influence over the mass media enterprise to foreign investors. A foreign investor in this case may validly profit from a mass media corporation with a foreign equity restriction.
Is is further pointed out in Section 142…
This scheme is not only prohibited by the 1987 Constitution but criminal liability is also imposed on those who violate foreign equity restrictions and evade nationalization laws of the Philippines through various modes of proxy arrangement, making it appear as legal, but the entirety of the arrangement is to accomplish a transation not allowed under Philippine laws.
ABS-CBN with all its star power, money, and resources could not fix its problems before the authorities found the gaping hole in their business that is on exhibit today. What’s really baffling to me is why Congress didn’t tackle the franchise renewal months before. This issue has been going on for years but they did nothing to fast-track it. Rumour has it that some congressmen lack “motivation”. Some are suggesting that they are waiting for some grease money from the owners before “doing their jobs”. This is not too-farfetched because they know that the owners are cashed-up. Desperate people do extra-ordinary things when it is crunch time.
Unfortunately for ABS-CBN, time is running out. Even if Congress tackles the franchise issue now, the Quo Warranto could squash the renewal if the Supreme Court rules the owners violated the law.  They are essentially toast.",Others
Why Preempt Congress from Deciding on ABS-CBN’s Franchise Renewal?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/why-preempt-congress-from-deciding-on-abs-cbns-franchise-renewal/,"“Why are Duterte and their minions so afraid to allow Congress’ franchise hearings on ABS-CBN? Because that’s where all facts are laid bare and made public: documents, expert testimonies, official records, witnesses. No fake news, no trolling. Just the facts. #holdABSCBNhearingsnow #thinkaboutit”
That was the message I received early this morning days after the Quo Warranto reportedly filed or to be filed by the Office of the Solicitor General which would prevent Congress from having to decide on the renewal of ABS-CBN’s franchise.
As I was thinking about the employees of ABS-CBN who are bound to lose their jobs and small businesses that will go belly up if the network’s franchise is not renewed, I couldn’t help but  agree with the statement wholeheartedly.
With people’s livelihoods at stake and with most of them staring at the prospect of financial hardship in the near term, I believe this administration owes it to the people to have everything laid down out in the open and have the elected representatives of the people decide with their conscience on the right thing to do.
I think the people whose lives will be thrown in shambles will mind the suffering a little less if they can be convinced of the JUSTNESS of what President Duterte wants done to ABS-CBN.
ABS-CBN isn’t just the Lopezes, it is ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS that rely on it.
I don’t want to sound melodramatic, but depriving thousands of people of their income at a time like this could be like a death sentence.
There really aren’t that many immediate job openings for broadcast professionals. That’s not just the few hundred of people who appear in front of the camera.
That includes engineers in various fields, directors, production staff, producers, writers, make up artists, video editors, graphics artists, computer programmers, technicians, utility people, drivers, mechanics, carpenters, and thousands of other workers.
A lot of these people may have even voted for Duterte in 2016 and his allies in Congress in 2019.
So it behooves President Duterte and his administration as well as his political allies to makes certain that the concerted effort to shutdown ABS-CBN truly comes from an intent to address a misdeed and ISN’T AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL OUT PUNISHMENT OUT OF PIQUE or PERSONAL VENDETTA.
Worse, I hope that this isn’t some immoral ploy by people in the halls of power to use Malacanang’s might to gain considerable stakes and perhaps control over one of the largest corporations in the Philippines.
Observing what was happening to ABS-CBN, a friend said, “Ungas naman kasi tong gusto mo magpasara. Masyado dinadaan sa bully tactics. Kung may atraso sa kanya o sa pamahalaan eh di habulin pero kelangan ba talaga ipasara? Mas abnoy pa to sa abnoy” (English translation: Those who want ABS-CBN shut down are real assholes. They’re using bullying tactics too much. If ABS-CBN has done something wrong to Duterte or committed an illegal act, they should be brought to court. Why does it have to be Duterte or his allies to shut it down? This is more abnormal than abnormal.”)
My friend’s statement is similar to the hundreds I’ve come across on social media. Infact, it may represent the sentiment of a majority of people who do not support calls to shutdown ABS-CBN.
Actually, a swift death would seem much more merciful than having to live through months and perhaps years of misery as one tries to adjust to life in another company or a completely new job — maybe overseas.
In fact, numerous studies equate the psychological impact of job loss to the death of a family member.
Research studies have shown that job loss can take a psychological and biological toll as well, leading to depression, anxiety disorders, increased somatic symptoms, such as fatigue or headaches, and higher rates of medical illness. This toll may be worse for men, who are socialized to evaluate their self-worth in terms of their financial and career success. Suicide attempts also rise with unemployment.

What gets me is that some people are so indifferent and apathetic towards the suffering of thousands that will lose their jobs if ABS-CBN is shutdown.
Is the Duterte administration willing to punish thousands along with the Lopezes over STILL TO BE PROVEN ALLEGATIONS? Do we still have a judicial system in place or is it now just playing second fiddle to the political dictates of those in power?
Nasaan ang malasakit? Where is the compassion that this administration says it has?
In anycase, I hope the Duterte administration provides some kind of safety net for all the workers that will be jobless should ABS-CBN shutdown.
But I doubt it can provide for the continuation of salaries and benefits that ABS-CBN employees are receiving right now.
Most likely, they’ll have to suffer the UNDESERVED HUMILIATION of having to BEG for subsistence from various government offices like the rest of the country’s indigent population.
