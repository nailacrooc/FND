It’s far from a foregone conclusion.
There were 2 council by-elections yesterday Reform UK won 0.
That’s 236 council by-elections since the General Election, just 14 seats won for Reform UK.

It’s Nigel Farage, in case you’ve forgotten – because he seems to have done.
Yet Farage’s American dream has gone slightly off the rails after Donald Trump’s most generous campaign donor, Elon Musk, decided not to bankroll his way into 10 Downing Street, instead setting his cap at Rupert Lowe – who has (by a huge coincidence) now been kicked out of Reform UK.

Well now a Reform supporter with a popular Twitter account has gone one better, suggesting in an argument against free breakfast clubs for school children that it’s possible for parents to make breakfast for their kids for just 72p per week. Or just over 10p per day!
She even suggested the ‘recipe’ that makes this possible. Over to you,
