It followed a 1,000-page report by its domestic intelligence agency which said views around ethnicity held by the AfD aim to exclude certain groups from equal participation in society. Which will surely come as no surprise to anyone with an interest in this sort of thing. It surprised Rubio, though, who went so far as to say this.

It’s Nigel Farage, in case you’ve forgotten – because he seems to have done. Yet Farage’s American dream has gone slightly off the rails after Donald Trump’s most generous campaign donor, Elon Musk, decided not to bankroll his way into 10 Downing Street, instead setting his cap at Rupert Lowe – who has (by a huge coincidence) now been kicked out of Reform UK. Despite the withdrawal of patronage, Farage still seems to be acting as the Trump-Musk regime’s unofficial UK spokesperson. Or possibly the position is official – we have no idea who’s paying him and for what. During his umpteenth appearance on a BBC political programme, Farage told Laura Kuenssberg that the UK needs a DOGE-style body for every council. We’re not quite sure whether he really thinks it, is making a play to get back in Musk’s good books, or both. We’re leaning towards both. Here’s what other people thought. Source",Politics

A huge part of the US Right’s schtick is that their free speech is somehow being curtailed. Donald Trump started his own social media site – Truth Social – to address that, Elon Musk bought a social media site and broke it, and now brave warrior Liz Truss is getting in on the act. The London Economic had the details. Truss told attendees at the Saving the West Bitcoin conference in Bedford that her platform will be part of a grassroots movement that will hold the government to account.

Here’s what Kwarteng had to say just yesterday. And here’s his letter of resignation to Truss after the prime minister told him to go today. Truss gave him the boot in a desperate bid to save her own job, despite the calamitous mini budget being very much a joint effort between Numbers 10 and 11.

By her own words, she resigned because she had so much integrity that a minor security breach was too far, yet not enough integrity to stop propping up a government whose policies worried her gravely. One part of her letter was particularly passive-aggressive. The PM’s response was much less personal. Grant Shapps, who supported Rishi Sunak in the leadership race, has been brought up from the back benches to fill the vacancy.
