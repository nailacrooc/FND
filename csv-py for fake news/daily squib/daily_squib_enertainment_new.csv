Epstein List: Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew Suddenly Get the Sweats,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54407-epstein-list-bill-clinton-and-prince-andrew-suddenly-get-the-sweats.html,2024,"Things are getting rather sweaty for the likes of serial visitors to Epstein Island, a place where nothing happened according to Bill Clinton and  Prince Andrew . It’s just not those two names on the Epstein list, but people like  Michael Jackson  and David Copperfield have recently been revealed by a US court.
Prince Andrew apparently does not have the ability to sweat, but as further allegations are revealed, he may start sweating like a priest at a choir boys convention.
As for Bill Clinton, this guy is as cool as a cucumber and will not be bothered by any allegations revealed about his time on Epstein Island, burying his cucumber deep inside the coterie of lithe young ladies on the island was just something an ex-president does. Besides, what’s a man to do when the old bag back home is a rug muncher?
Michael Jackson apparently visited the island as well, but here is the mystery. Did Epstein ship in a bunch of underage boys for his visit?
Whatever happens in the near future is just pure entertainment."
Experts: Why Harry is Desperate to Reconcile With the Royal Family he Hates,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57393-experts-why-harry-is-desperate-to-reconcile-with-the-royal-family-he-hates.html,2024,"One may think it strange that after giving the British royal family a serious shedload of vitriol and nastiness in the press and in tell-all books that the wayward Prince Harry was well done with the Windsors, but apparently not. For some reason, he now wants to reconcile with his brother William and the King, or maybe he is being egged on by someone to do so. Despite previously demanding a grovelling public apology from King Charles and Prince William, Harry is now begging to come back into the fold on a limited basis and seeing as there was no apology from the royals, he is so desperate that he is even foregoing on the apology in his rush to get back into the Firm. To reconcile with the royal family is now priority number one for the Sussex Squad led by masterminds Meghan Markle and Omid Scobie.
Royal expert, Hugh Levington Carrington Smythe reveals the truth of the matter.
“They desperately need more material. Most certainly it is Meghan pushing Harry into a possible reconciliation. The Netflix thing has dried up because there is no more fuel in the can as they have already spilled the beans on everything they knew. Netflix and the other US trash media are hungry for fresh news and salty details about the Windsors. In isolation thousands of miles away from the source of their income, they need to be around the royals so they can get more gasoline to throw on the fire thus keeping their money making train going by selling out and trashing the royal family.
“The truth is that the Sussexes have capitalised on their royal title up to a point, but it’s not enough to keep up with their very expensive private jet lifestyle. They are leaking hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on useless Meghan initiatives, lawyers, PR, private security, clothes and private jets as well as the upkeep of their Montecito Mcmansion with all the staff.
“The Meghan plan for Harry is to infiltrate the Windsors proclaiming a faux reconciliation and to eventually get them talking about private matters again. This may take a few trips, or maybe a lengthier stay, but this is the ultimate plan. As Meghan knows, it is all about finding the weak spots in a target then capitalising on that.
“Once the Sussexes have gleaned enough information then they will simply rinse and repeat their previous malicious attacks on the royal family. It is sad that Harry and Meghan made the last few years of the late  Queen Elizabeth II’s life so miserable , but it is possible they will have no qualms about doing the same to King Charles III for money.
“Meghan’s American River Orchard brand is being universally panned and that grift may actually lose money than make any. Netflix is down the poo chute because producers only want new material and not rehashed gossip and stories from 10 years ago.
“It’s all down to making money off the Windsor family and using their Sussex brand as much as possible, and to reconcile with the royal family is now the big plan.”"
Please Spend Your Money Needlessly On Black Fraud Day,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58609-please-spend-your-money-needlessly-on-black-fraud-day.html,2024,"Yes, you need to spend your money on supposedly “cheap” Chinese tat on Black Fraud Day, an annual tradition exported to the world by the Americans.
End of year stock clearance of useless junk
We’re here to convince you that the fucking deals you are coerced to buy are a fantastic opportunity to spend all of your money on Black Fraud Day. Get your credit card out and do not think as you buy another piece of utter crap that will either break in a few weeks time or be obsolete in less than that time.
In rip off Britain, consumers are treated with such disdain and contempt with overpriced products compared to the rest of the world that a simple tiny reduction in price is seen as a massive fucking deal, when in reality it is still more expensive than anywhere else.
Imagine the throbbing veins on Jeff Bozo’s bald head as he watches the sales figures and his offshore bank balance reach new fucking heights.  Bozo  is so happy that you are spending all your money on things you do not need, he is so ecstatic he ejaculates over one of his multiple screen set-ups.
Most of the so-called deals are not actually deals, but you don’t know that, thankfully for the companies selling you utter shit. If you were to do your due diligence and research the prices, you would realise that, but no, you have been dazzled momentarily, and you have to get that Black Fraud Day deal.
Anyway, here’s to the Wonderful Black Fraud Day — empty your wallets you fucking chumps, you truly deserve everything you get."

The New Craze Taking Over Progressives and Woke Social Justice Extremists,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59231-the-new-craze-taking-over-progressives-and-woke-social-justice-extremists.html,2024,"They are the most hated people in the world, the automaton virtue signalling indoctrinated little Stalins and little Hitlers who think they are morally above everyone else, where they claim to be woke “progressives” but are in fact  intolerant  regressives who are addicted to deluded ‘trendy’ omnicauses and are  outrage-seeking  fucking morons.
Well, they have found a new craze, and for a change this one seems to be rather useful.
According to media reports in California, and places like Islington and Hackney in the UK, woke people are flocking to specialist surgeons to undergo a proprietary treatment that has been resurrected from the 1940s. Yes, we’re talking lobotomies. It’s the new woke trend for the wokerati, and far-left Marxist social justice warriors are loving it.
British and American universities have also seen an up tick in both woke students and the tutors who indoctrinate them, flocking to the surgeons to have their frontal lobe’s severed.
The surgical procedure was pioneered by the Portuguese neurologist and Nobel Laureate António Egas Moniz in 1935. The lobotomy (Leucotomy) involves severing connections in the brain’s prefrontal cortex. The surgery causes most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, to be severed.
Professor Almada Rinkin, who has performed over 1,500 lobotomies on progressive woke patients in the last three months, has revealed the simplicity of the operation and its amazing results.
“We bring these raving extremist lunatics who wrongly call themselves “progressives” into the operating room and give them some general anaesthetic. Some of them continue babbling on about whichever cause they are fighting that particular week. It’s okay, we let them babble on. Before the procedure, they are clearly indoctrinated by some sort of ideology, but after a few tweaks to their frontal lobe, a little slicing here or there, boom! They are cured. We tested one blue-haired woman who came in ranting about the virtues of throwing orange paint over priceless paintings in art galleries for the cause of the environment. After the procedure, which took less than half an hour, the patient did not even know what an oil painting was or even cared about such things as eco causes.
“On another occasion, a patient could not stop ranting about the virtues of transgender men in women’s sports and shower rooms. We cured this person in less than fifteen minutes. After the procedure, we showed the patient a photograph of a large man with a moustache wearing a dress whilst playing volleyball for an all-female team. The patient did not even twitch or acknowledge the subject matter in the photo.”
Because of the demand for the operations, there is now a large backlog of woke progressives awaiting the surgical procedure, and although it is not advised, some are performing the procedure on themselves. If you are a woke progressive, please do not use a pencil or other sharp object on yourself, you must seek professional medical advice first so that your illness can be cured in a clinical, safe environment."
Should Satirical Cartoonist Steve Bell Have Been Cancelled?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53498-should-satirical-cartoonist-steve-bell-have-been-cancelled.html,2023,"Steve Bell, the much celebrated satirical cartoonist, has been fired from his job at the Guardian, otherwise known as the Grauniad. He was fired for making a cartoon piece that sort of depicted Israeli leader Netanyahu with a Shylock style pound of flesh in the shape of the Gaza territory on his body. While this may be highly offensive to many, should it have been cancelled and deleted from the world? Yes, it is skirting the edges of offensive antisemitic trope land, but satire and cartoons are meant to skim those surfaces, to shock, to make one think.
Steve Bell is most certainly very far-left in his politics and is probably a full-on communist, but that is not a crime in itself. The far-left inhabit pretty much all of the media and world of entertainment/comedy. All the Big Tech companies are extreme far left, and now many corporations virtue signal to far-left activism. So why was Steve Bell, bell-ended, by the same far-left ideologues who run the entire facade of the media?
As babies were being slaughtered in their cots and entire families kidnapped and taken to Gaza, Steve Bell chose the side of the terrorists who were committing these atrocities against unarmed women and children. He would, of course, not dare to depict the bloodthirsty savagery of the Hamas terrorists in a bad light. This, to his far left compatriots, would be an affront to his communist Leninist values, or whatever soviet Marxist section he idolises so much. Where Steve Bell went wrong was he was so entrenched in far-left ideology, which is inherently anti-Semitic, that he was compelled to fall on the side of the terrorists. There is no other way for far-left socialist/communists to go, they have to take the route of cowardice and are inherently so indoctrinated, they have no morality left in their staunchly red commie souls. This is a supreme trap for any satirist, to be entrenched in a political ideology that skews their entire viewpoint, and it also makes them very predictable. The other trap for any satirist is to do their work too soon, and this is the ultimate spot that Bell failed in. The blood was still fresh on the cots of the Jewish babies who were beheaded by Hamas savages. Steve Bell still went ahead with no qualms, and at the end of the day he paid the ultimate price. The good satirist does not go in for the kill immediately after an atrocity of this kind, he must let the event simmer for a while before acting. Think it over, let it ferment like a good wine before unleashing their wrath.
That being said, there are no rights or wrongs in satire and satirical cartoonist Steve Bell did what he did, and he does what he does, so in satirical terms he is and was on point. You can completely discount everything written in the previous paragraph,  satire  is a sacred art, there are no specific rules, and it should be protected wherever and from whoever it emanates in all its forms. As for offensive material — stop using kid gloves for everything. If you don’t like it, fuck off, don’t look at it, go and do something else. Satirists should be able and allowed to express any fucking thing they want because life in general is not always nice and happy. Nasty shit happens a lot, stuff that is shocking. Good satirists like Steve Bell deal with it, the good, the bad and the ugly. Shame the Grauniad finally went to cancel a satirical cartoonist who lives and breathes through his anger and vitriol for pretty much everything. That is what a satirist is and should be. Humans should be allowed to see and feel all parameters of their spectrum of emotion without fear of cancellation. You know when cancel culture, wokism and censorship is getting really bad when the far-left are even cancelling their own people. Now, that is fucked up!
Adieu, farewell Mr. Bell…"

Hamas leader praises Khalifa
“I would like to thank the upstanding American celebrity and former porn star Mia Khalifa for supporting the beheading of babies, cold-blooded murder of innocent women and children in Israel.
“Here in the Hamas bunker we watch her videos religiously, I especially love the DP scenes, and her giving hand jobs to two men simultaneously whilst being serviced from both ends.
“We at Hamas HQ can’t thank you enough for your undying support of our atrocities, and we vow to erase Israel from the earth. That lesbian scene you did in one of your many movies was delightful to watch, and the squirting shot at the end really did it for me.
“Do not worry that  Playboy  has fired you, they are a machine of the Zionist pigs who control everything. Once we have completed our job of making the Palestinian idiot civilians who follow us blindly destitute we will send a private jet for you to come to Gaza where you can film a few scenes with the Hamas crew. See you soon.” *blows a big kiss*"
‘I tried the hack for perfectly cut tomatoes and it blew my mind’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53517-i-tried-the-hack-for-perfectly-cut-tomatoes-and-it-blew-my-mind.html,2023,"A woman has been left mind-blown after trying out a viral hack cutting tomatoes and discovering it worked.
A TikToker, who goes by the name gendleblatt52z, shared the video and asked her followers: “Is the viral tomato hack the secret to perfectly cut tomatoes? Let’s try it.”
She immediately increased her follower count by 23 million, as she also became TikTok famous.
To do the tomato  hack , first, you need to get a tomato, she said, which according to experts should never be stored under a mattress.
Next, you put the tomato on a chopping board.
“You need to use a sharp knife to chop the tomato into slices,” she said.
The TikToker said this is the moment when you put the knife on the tomato and apply some pressure.
She went on: “So you’re gently slicing the tomato.”
After slicing several of the tomatoes, she then put them in a bowl.
Describing how she cut the tomatoes, she said: “I put just enough pressure on the knife so it slices through the tomato.”
Next, she said she picked up the chopping board and scraped the tomato slices into the bowl.
“I’ve tried lots of different methods, but I’ve never gotten one that works so well. Golly gosh! This has truly changed my life. You too must watch my TikTok channel and subscribe.
“So this was a surprise.”
After cutting the tomatoes, she added them to a salad before eating them.
She said: “This gets a yes from me because my tomatoes are now sliced and this one came out perfect.”
The TikToker held up the tomato slices, showing that the TikTok hack does work."

Escaped Iranian Spy Could Be Cast as Next James Bond,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52858-escaped-iranian-spy-could-be-cast-as-next-james-bond.html,2023,"The Iranian spy, Daniel Khalife, who  escaped  from a supposed maximum security jail, could be cast as the next James Bond, producers from Eon Productions have revealed.
“I mean, his escape was exactly how James Bond would have done it. What a feat. Right under the noses of the idiots who think they are prison officers. Well, it seems the Keystone Cops have finally caught the fellow, we are still hiring, and he’s fucking hired. Forget about all those other ponces who are trying to get the job, we want real spies with balls, not effete luvvie poseurs,” Rhubarb Broccoli, Cubby Broccoli’s nephew, revealed in Film Weekly.
According to reports from the shamed HMP Wandsworth prison, the Iranian spy crafted a makeshift belt from scraps and sneaked under a food truck from the kitchens, where he hoisted himself under the vehicle as it drove straight out the prison gates.
“James Bond has been played by an Australian, Scotsman, Irishman, Englishman and now why not an Iranian?” Broccoli added.
The next eagerly awaited James Bond  film  will probably be another woke, humourless mess, but isn’t every film released these days. It is to be expected as the entire industry has succumbed to the Marxist woke cult that is destroying the film business from the inside."
D-List Former Actress Attacks Quentin Tarantino and Mike Myers,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47598-d-list-former-actress-attacks-quentin-tarantino-and-mike-myers.html,2022,"Here’s the way we see it at the Squib. The fucking toenail clippings of Quentin Tarantino have more worth and clout than 1 million D-List Meghan Markles. The ass hairs from Mike Myers’ asshole have more worth and value than Meghan Markle will ever know or realise.
Who the hell is Meghan Markle anyway? Apart from being a dangerous narcissistic manipulative grifter who latched on to some royal single-brain-celled dumbo, she is a D-list actress with not much talent apart from having the ability to suck a golf ball through a garden hose. What have been Meghan Markle’s achievements so far? …crickets…
“Meghan Markle is a nobody, a stain on not only the British royal family but on the entire human race. Here is a dumb cretin who cannot distinguish the nuances and rhetoric of certain film genres. Yes, there are gross exaggerations in Tarantino films, but that’s what makes them so enjoyable to watch. Austin Powers utilises the technique of parody and comedy with exaggerations and general silliness as a form of entertainment. This is something the humourless piece of ass chunder, Meghan Markle is completely lost to. She has no idea, and should be completely ignored by the entirety of the entertainment industry. I bet this fucking moron has hired a stasi woke fact-checker to fact-check comedy and satire. What kind of a misinformed idiot fact check’s comedy or satire?” one angry film executive revealed on Wednesday.
Art is subjective. There is no need for justification, or explanation."
Man Actually Believes a Single Word Uttered From TikTok ‘Influencer’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48392-man-actually-believes-a-single-word-uttered-from-tiktok-influencer.html,2022,"A 28-year-old man from High Wycombe revealed today that he actually believed a single word from a TikTok influencer.
“Yes, what the TikTok influencer said must be true because he has over 40 million subscribers and over 200 million views. Everything he said must be true just from the sheer number of likes on what he said,” the man revealed.
The Chinese controlled social network TikTok is well-known to security agencies as a tool utilised by the CCP to destabilise Western countries with inane, useless videos and dangerous disinformation."
Fat Ugly Gay Builder in Nappy Music Video Causes Outrage,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49237-fat-ugly-gay-builder-in-nappy-music-video-causes-outrage.html,2023,"A hypersexualised music video featuring an overweight ugly gay builder in a nappy cavorting around a homosexual orgy drinking urine and miming to autotune has quite rightly caused outrage.
The vile video is also proof that YouTube and its so-called squeaky clean advertisers are all hypocrites. No doubt the video will be completely monetised despite coming down hard on everyone else on the platform for very mild infractions. Top woke brands are fine with spreading this kind of excrement around.
Plastered all over YouTube and other sites, the grotesque video is even shown to children as young as five, but because it is gay it is given special permission and allowed to proliferate across all media in the hope it will indoctrinate young children and normalise paedophilia.
“There’s nothing we can do about it. This is the current agenda, so it has been given the green light from all of the controllers including the Google monopoly,” someone from some irrelevant media watchdog element revealed.
The crass vulgar music video has great comedy value, though, if you can bear to watch it without cringing. Obviously, no one who participates in the video has any form of dignity left or any capacity for self-analysis, let alone a measure of true aesthetic awareness."
James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of the Water,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48731-james-camerons-avatar-the-way-of-the-water.html,2022,"If you are thinking of taking the family, or friends, or partner to a film of this calibre, you must, and we insist…must…watch it on IMAX 3D. As a piece of work created by Cameron and his crew it is an amazing experience with 3D on an IMAX screen.
Folks, in these times of utter depression and misery, this is what we need, an escape from the burden of reality, and it is James Cameron’s meticulous cinematic wizardry that will take you into a fantasy world of blue for three hours and twelve minutes. Hollywood needs to move in this direction of creating grand entertaining fiction.
The message pretty much given in this sequel is that humans generally suck shit, sure not all humans but especially the corporate military industrial complex conglomerate monopoly business people who basically bulldoze over everything to build fucking car parks and shopping malls over nature reserves and native homes.
This is basic cowboys and Injuns stuff. The good guys are obviously the natives and the bad guys are the harpoon gun toting cowboys.
As for Edie Falco from the Sopranos, we were expecting her to suddenly come out with a plate of gabagool, and chastise Tony for the latest whacking of some wise guy.
The dialogue? Forget about that; sure it’s simple but that is not what the film is about. Films like this are about pure action and visual entertainment with an underlying message — that’s it.
The amount of processing power to render this film must have been huge. The CGI at points did have its flaws, but for a fantasy sci-fi the attention to detail was pore deep, like pores in the skin texture and lighting effects. The human to alien interaction was almost perfect, there was not much textural or granular difference, although in 3D, sometimes the tracking or frame rate was a little jumpy.
If you don’t detest humans after watching this, then you ain’t human. You must go and watch this film, a serious addition to Cameron’s backlog. It is the perfect seasonal entertainment that will entertain."
Greta Thunberg to Star in Eco Pizza Porn Video to Taunt ‘Toxic’ Influencer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48819-greta-thunberg-to-star-in-eco-pizza-porn-video-to-taunt-toxic-influencer.html,2022,"It doesn’t get more insidious than this. Darling of the eco hysteria business Greta Thunberg announced on Friday through her management company that she will be starring in an eco pizza porn video. Why would this sweet little girl be doing such a thing?
Big Dick Energy
“I want to humiliate this toxic influencer and his toxic ways. He has small dick energy, and I only like my Isterband at 10 inches. Anything below that is small for me. Throw in a couple of vegan pizzas I can roll around in, and we have some real dirty Swedish eco porn.”
The strictly naughty videos will have images of icebergs melting and polar bears stranded on rocks to compound the effect of helplessness that is Thunberg’s trademark.
The people that control Thunberg want to promote a dirtier side to the angelic character that everyone knows and loves.
“She is not promoting breeding with this video, on the contrary, she will be promoting self-love and pizza to save the planet. Greta also wants to put two fingers up to that toxic idiot who got caught by the police from a pizza box. We never mention his name here in the Eco HQ, just call him a ‘liten skit’,” Göta Söderström, spokeswoman for Thunberg revealed on Friday."
Why Aren’t Rap Artists Subject to ‘Sensitivity Readers’?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49481-why-arent-rap-artists-subject-to-sensitivity-readers.html,2023,"Woke publishers pandering to Soviet censorship drives pushed by the CCP in the West are now employing ‘sensitivity readers’ to butcher and water down literature by formerly celebrated authors. The latest victim to fall prey to sensitivity readers is the late children’s author  Roald Dahl . As the paragons of Western literature are daily defiled by these woke lords of censorship, one can only ask the question, why are rap artists given free rein to produce their often caustic, racist and misogynistic lyrics without any censorship?
Rap people often splatter their lyrics with the Latin word for black, and talk about their ‘bitches’, their ‘hoes’ as well as tales of dealing hard drugs and murder.
“African Americans are free to write the most vile lyrics simply because they are black, and are a protected species in America. If a rapper is white or any other race, then they are vulnerable to censorship and cancellation,” a record executive for a rap label revealed.
Call it hip hop, rap, or R’N’B whatever it is called, if it has black people spewing out their vile hatred and nasty lyrics, it is okay with the white liberal scum who enable that shit."

Harry Loses Spare Tyre in Unhinged 405 Drama,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48961-harry-loses-spare-tyre-in-unhinged-405-drama.html,2023,"You need a spare tyre if you own a vehicle. Getting caught out without a spare tyre can be a cumbersome and fruitless experience.
The needless drama unfolded on a regular Saturday for the Sussexes. Their fleet of gas guzzling SUVs were on the 405 somewhere deep in the bowels of Los Angeles. The 405 is an awful, smelly, polluted car park where cars and massive trucks creep along for miles bumper to bumper at two miles an hour at the most. Road rage is a common occurrence, something about the hopeless nature of being stuck on a road between off-ramps makes motorists lose their sanity. Some resort to firearms to let off steam. Amongst the maelstrom of cars spewing out their toxic emissions on the go-slow, letting off a few rounds into other vehicles in utter frustration somehow soothes the souls of these tormented individuals enslaved to their shiny metal Lords of Pollution. You might hear a few cracks or gentle thuds, maybe your rear windscreen shatters suddenly, or alternatively you or a passenger may absorb a few bullets. Shit happens in the blink of an eye as the rows and rows of cars amble forwards slowly. When moving a few metres is a mission celebrated by a couple of whoops, having a bullet pass through one of your kidneys only to lodge itself in your dashboard is a welcome relief. Yet, to have one of your tyres suddenly release all its air in deflatory alarm, is quite disconcerting. You rummage around in the boot, eventually realising that there is no spare tyre, in fact you realise there never was a spare fucking tyre in your boot. That kind of thing happened to Harry. This time, Harry just saw red. Unhinged, deranged and demented, the jumbled schizoid thoughts entered his head and ordered him to shoot. Where was his team of therapists now? Like a wild eyed, sweating Samoan lawyer on Adrenochrome, Harry’s hallucinations took a sinister grip over him. Self-control and clear thought had gone a long time ago, the serotonin receptors in his brain destroyed by years of cocaine abuse and snorting tequila shots up his nasal passage in Mahiki. With his vision blurred, Harry suddenly saw Camilla laughing at him in a Volvo. Immediately, he grabbed his security officer’s revolver and wound down the window, letting off a few rounds. Meghan, shocked, started yelling in abject fear. This man she controlled and brainwashed had suddenly broken free from her hypnotic spell and gone motherfuckin’ stir-crazy. Cocaine is a helluva drug, Rick James once said, and now here was Harry blasting away at car tyres, windshields, anything that was there. Gun in hand, Harry suddenly spied a man in a Mercedes wearing a turban. Immediately, his frazzled mind transported him to the dusty, hot hell of Camp Bastion. It’s the Taliban! I must exterminate with extreme prejudice. Good thing, without an automatic Apache helicopter targeting system, Harry is a useless shot. Multiple rounds from Harry’s gun ricochet off the car’s bumper, then zoom into the air. Meghan summarily projectile vomits onto the protection officer scrambling to get his fucking gun back. Harry then sees the face of William in a Mustang, and it’s laughing at him. Blam! Blam! I am the real king, Harry shouts wildly, letting off the final few shots in the general direction of the vehicle. As the flashing blue lights engulf the area, Harry suddenly snaps momentarily out of his psychosis. It’s a good thing he’s also the Duke of Sussex and immune from prosecution. Oh shit, he then realises where he is — America.
Story continues next week."
‘Leathery Lizard’ Camilla Made Harry’s Skin Crawl,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48887-leathery-lizard-camilla-made-harrys-skin-crawl.html,2023,"In his newly released autobiography, Prince Harry recounts how meeting Camilla was like undergoing an injection such was his distaste and hatred of her. He describes her akin to a leathery lizard, hissing and clawing her way around the corridors. Harry idolised his mother Diana, therefore to have an ‘evil entity’ like Camilla take over and replace his mother was a living nightmare. One can almost feel the absolute disgust Harry feels towards this ‘vile interloper’ who killed off Diana’s marriage with Charles.
“Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. That one may smile and smile and be a villain. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in our philosophy.”
Harry portrays himself as a Hamletesque character, and views Charles, his father, as someone poisoned, subverted and corrupted by this woman they call Camilla. Where Diana is portrayed as a being of light, virtuous and truly benevolent, Camilla is portrayed as an evil conniving slithering snake operating in the shadows in Harry’s book.
Evil Stepmother Camilla
Consequently, we will probably never know the truth about what occurred in those heady days. The Netflix Crown series imagined what happened but one should never take such tabloid representations as truth. Whether people take Harry’s words of vitriol and anger as truth is up to the reader, however one must always have balance and the other point of view in any circumstance. The Palace is thus silent, and this allows things like Harry’s accusations to fester, to add doubt as well as to completely besmirch the character of the current Queen Consort. The royal PR machinery has gone to great lengths to clean up Camilla’s image over the past few decades. Could this swift cruel blow from Harry finally reduce the smoke and mirrors to a pile of smouldering rubble?"

"Oscars: Lost Hollywood is Truly Nothing, Nowhere All At Once",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49726-oscars-lost-hollywood-is-truly-nothing-nowhere-all-at-once.html,2023,"Imagine a bunch of overloading overclocked Chinese computers spitting out nonsensical code in a tiny room all jumping around, bumping hysterically into each other for 139 very, very, very long minutes. You may choose to watch this shit, or you may not, but for some reason, woke Hollywood just gave that film a cluster of Oscars. In fact, that mish mash of overclocked nonsense somehow elongated time, where each minute endured trying to watch the clucking actors talking gibberish extends to an eternity where one truly is transported into the worst sort of boredom that has ever existed. Watching your toenails grow is a preferable option.
The Oscars this year did not involve African American thuggery, but maybe it should have. Maybe, having some sense slapped into these overpaid mollycoddled useless luvvies would actually bring about a slight modicum of true creativity.
Let us face it, Hollywood is so dead that nothing can save it now. It has killed off every legacy film with woke remakes, it has revelled in CGI laden amusement park superhero films by the double dozen, it has reduced the art of cinema to nothing but a propaganda tool for woke activism paid for by Chinese financiers seeking to destabilise the nation from within…blah di blah di blah.
In 2000, 46.33 million people watched the Oscars, today, the woke Oscars can barely scrape a viewership of 7-8 million if they are lucky.
This is what you get when there is no bravery, no innovation, no true creativity. Instead, you have unadventurous woke bland soulless mediocre detritus that only plays the safe card.
Death happened a long time ago, the Oscars and Hollywood non-film industry are now in the advanced stage of decomposition."
Harry and Meghan Want to Bring Archie’s 80ft Bouncy Castle to Charles Coronation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49544-harry-and-meghan-want-to-bring-archies-80ft-bouncy-castle-to-charles-coronation.html,2023,"The meddlesome couple from California want to upstage King Charles’ Coronation ceremony in May by bringing along a massive 80ft bouncy castle for Archie’s birthday to upstage the weak king.
“The bouncy castle will be set up directly on the steps of Westminster Abbey and photographers will be called to take photographs of young Archie jumping around in it. There will be some dodgy geezers from a fairground assisting and some old speakers playing garage music at high volume. The Sussexes have even hired a DJ from Cricklewood to play the awful tunes. The prince thinks this stunt will raise his and his wife’s poor profile,” a PR agent in London revealed.
Westminster Council were contacted by the Sussexes and a proposal was presented to officials last week.
If this goes ahead, it could derail the entire Charles Coronation and even cause a health and safety nightmare. How the royal procession will be able to access the entrance of Westminster Abbey when it is blocked by an 80ft bouncy castle and hundreds of photographers along with a Netflix film crew is not known?
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were contacted for comment, but refused to respond."
Dolly Parton’s Breasts Could be Displayed in Nashville Museum,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51251-dolly-partons-breasts-could-be-displayed-in-nashville-museum.html,2023,"“We all know how everything in America has to be big. If it ain’t big, it ain’t good. Same goes for Dolly Parton’s breasts, they’re big, just like her sweet voice is big. She’s given us permission, when she passes to the Grand Ole Opry in the sky, to donate her wonderful big mammas to our museum so millions of visitors every year can enjoy those beautiful fun bags like many did when she was alive,” Curston Dean McGuinness, owner and curator of the Nashville Museum told Fox News.
Stand by your mams
In fact, the Jolene starlet has had each of her humungous breasts insured for $45 million and the cherry on the top, each nipple has an additional insurance premium of $15 million. The Swiss bank that insures Dolly’s bazongas recently went bust on her bust, but luckily the Fed bailed them out with a special chesty finance deal.
Trip down mammary lane
Buck Thornton, was an acquaintance of Dolly’s in 1967, and remembers her cantaloupes with fondness.
“Dolly, bless her, has such a big heart, I never met a lady who could not only sing like her, but she could hug the whole world with her warm ta-ta’s, bless her. She let me do a Bombay Roll on her backstage just after a show in Texas. I’ll never forget her face as I drained all I had over those dang beauteous jelly-filled babylons of pure country goodness.”"
When Gonzo Met Serge Gainsbourg,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51255-when-gonzo-met-serge-gainsbourg.html,2023,"Serge Gainsbourg was a goddamn lunatic. A madman of music, a savant of smut, a maverick of melody. He was a genius, a degenerate, a saint, and a sinner all rolled into one. And for anyone with half a brain and a shred of taste, he was one of the greatest musicians of all time.
I first heard Gainsbourg’s music back in the day, when I was living high on the hog and chasing the American Dream. And let me tell you, it was like nothing I’d ever heard before. The man was a fucking magician, weaving together elements of jazz, funk, rock, and pop into a sound that was entirely his own. He had a voice like a rusty chainsaw, but he could sing like an angel when he wanted to. And his lyrics were pure poetry, even when he was singing about the filthiest things you could imagine.
But what really set Gainsbourg apart was his complete lack of give-a-fuck. He didn’t care what anyone thought of him or his music. He was a true outsider, a rebel without a cause, a punk before punk was even a thing. He pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, and he did it with style, flair, and a shit-eating grin.
And let’s not forget his legendary love life. The man was a walking, talking sex scandal, bedding some of the most beautiful women in the world and scandalizing polite society in the process. He was a wild man, a libertine, a lothario, and a legend.
But even beyond all the hype and the scandal, Gainsbourg was the real deal. He was a true artist, a master of his craft, and a visionary. He created music that was both beautiful and ugly, pure and profane, sophisticated and raw. He was a poet of the perverse, a bard of the bizarre, a troubadour of the taboo.
And now, years after his death, his music still sounds as fresh, as daring, as utterly fucking insane as it did when he first recorded it. He was a true original, a one-of-a-kind, a force of nature. And if you’re not listening to him right now, you’re missing out on one of the greatest musical experiences of your life.
Serge Gainsbourg. The man, the myth, the fucking legend. Bow down and pay your respects, you poor, sad, unenlightened motherfuckers."
Britney Spears Keeps Her Clothes On Shocker,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47609-britney-spears-keeps-her-clothes-on-shocker.html,2022,"Britney Spears fans are concerned for her mental wellbeing after it was revealed in a series of selfies the 40-year-old mime artist took whilst fully clothed.
The constant attention seeking former pop starlet has shocked her fans by walking in public with a pair of jeans, a blouse and even a hat.
“This is insane, man! I know she is a narcissist, but to actually keep her frickin’ clothes on is an absolute disgrace. How low is Britney prepared to stoop,” one outraged fan revealed on some inconsequential social media site.
Some of her fans are now even questioning Britney’s mental health state by her latest outrageous actions of actually wearing clothes.
“Like, we’re used to Britney’s attention seeking narcissistic  naked  selfies everywhere, and she threw us a curveball there. She’s gone full 5150! They need to take her in, blast her skull with electric shock treatment or something to rewire her brain,” another fan ranted.

My Essay On Gender Equality in the Workplace,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45572-my-essay-on-gender-equality-in-the-workplace.html,2022,"W hile I might have only ever worked in an office environment for a grand total of 7 hours when hired one summer to re-organize a lawyers’ library in Toronto, Canada, I can safely say that I am an expert in the field of gender dynamics in the office.
You see during those 7 hours I witnessed what I can safely say is the greatest separator against the female gender. A divide so great that it truly keeps women separate and not equal in the workplace. This problem has existed ever since women were granted access into the office environment, from the early days in the typing pool or the operators’ room all the way up to today, where we can proudly witness women ascending to the highest echelons of corporate life.
While women have struggled to achieve financial equality and titles, there is still so much work to be done to achieve true equality in the areas that really require our attention. Because you see the true deficits of women’s equality are the subtle problems, the micro problems, the tiny issues that we might miss if we don’t pay attention. These small problems slip through the cracks and get lost, like a lonely polar bear cub in search of its mother in the frosty tundra. Yes and like the tiny polar bear cub these problems can grow and become fearsome creatures, ready to attack! I invite you, all of you, to become emboldened like the tiny cub. To take action and fight like the polar bear must fight to survive, so that this problem of inequality can be eradicated for the next generation of women!
Of course, the issue I am speaking about today is an issue every woman both in the workplace and out of it has faced at least once in her life, if not on a regular and ongoing basis. A problem so common, yet so ignored that it remains untouched by our politicians, our scientists, even our Instagram influencers barely go near this subject it is seemingly so beyond repair. The issue of course that I am speaking about is the ridiculously tiny women’s pants (trouser) pocket.
Although women have been wearing trousers since the year 1851 our pockets remain as restrictive as our rights were in that very same year. While revolutions have been fought and won and women have finally made it from the kitchen into the boardroom, we are still shackled to these heavy, expensive pieces of luggage we’re told to call purses. The item that is practically assigned to us at birth, as if the doctor pulls you out and says, “congrats! It’s a girl! Would you like leather or snakeskin?” That’s right, these bags we carry around that keep us from running fast enough to catch a toddler or get caught in subway doors, these poorly designed contraptions are holding us back. And why? Because we can’t even fit an iPhone in our trouser pockets, let alone our dignity.
I’ll take you back to that summer I worked at Addario, Green and Mitchell LLC in Toronto so many moons ago. I arrived in the morning, wearing my usual overalls and sneakers (I had been told the office would be empty for a corporate retreat and to dress casually if I wanted to). I entered the law library to get my work started when I heard a noise in the next office down. I poked my head into what I thought was an empty room only to find Maria Douglas Hofkin, junior clerk, sitting at her desk typing. I told her who I was and why I was there. The interaction only lasted a few minutes, but it would be burned into my memory for the next decade of my life. Because the next minute, Spencer K Franklin walked down the hallway in our direction with a smile on his face and nothing in his hands. He arrived at the office door and announced he was going to order lunch and would we like anything? I declined having just eaten two massive burritos, but Maria Douglas Hofkin said sure, sushi might be nice. Without skipping a beat, Spencer K Franklin reached into his trouser pocket and retrieved a small notepad and a small pen with a cap. He took down Maria Douglas Hofkin’s order and put the notebook and pen back in his pocket. Out of the exact same pocket, he took out a packet of gum and offered me a piece. I stared at him in awe. As he chewed, he went back into his pocket once again and took out his wallet, offering Maria Douglas Hofkin 20 dollars he borrowed from her the night before at karaoke. She said keep it, sushi is expensive.
Almost as if he was showing off, he went into his Narnia sized pocket once again and took out a full sized comb and proceeded to comb his hair while he chewed his gum. My mouth must have been wide open because the next thing I knew, Maria Douglas Hofkin was asking if I was alright. Before I could answer she was already getting up from her desk and walking towards me and that’s when it happened. It could have only been an instant, but it felt like slow motion. Maria Douglas Hofkin stood up from her desk, she was wearing a smart burgundy pantsuit that fit her very well. As she stood from her desk, she went to put her cell phone in her pants pocket. I spotted it instantly. Her Samsung Galaxy S10 barely made it 3 centimetres into her left pocket before she started walking towards me. She only took two steps before that phone flew out of its shallow holder, spinning through the air and landing with a piercing crack on the cement floor. We all stared at the phone, faced down, knowing in our hearts what had happened.
Looking embarrassed, Maria Douglas Hofkin quickly bent down to pick up her phone and as fast as you can say wage gap, her face fell; the screen had cracked. I turned to look at Spencer K Franklin, who said nothing but plunged both his hands into his Grand Canyon deep pockets as he began to back away slowly. Was it his fault? No. But he knew, deep down, he knew his presence and the presence of his gigantic pockets was longer welcome. I sat with Maria Douglas Hofkin as she wept and booked an appointment at the nearest screen replacement service store. We were connected now, through our bond of tiny pockets. Sisters in arms.
So my call to you now is this; don’t stand idly by with your hands in your pockets — or hanging halfway out if you wear women’s trousers. Do something. Say something. Write your local politician, or your local Levi’s store. Tell your children, tell your friends, tell your postman! Women deserve true equality, true freedom and independence from purses. Tiny pockets must end! Thank you!"
Demented Biden Was Shaking the Hands of Ghosts Who Voted For Him,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45609-demented-biden-was-shaking-the-hands-of-ghosts-who-voted-for-him.html,2022,"The sad figure of a confused and demented Joe Biden shaking hands with thin air after his latest mumbling incoherent speech has been confirmed by ghost experts that Biden was in fact shaking hands with ghosts.
“During the election in 2020, Democrat states were submitting hundreds of thousands of ballots from deceased people. When these fake ballots endorsing Biden were questioned by some election watchers, the Democrats simply ignored the damning data and the media ghosted the story citing conspiracy theories. Well, it was all true. Joe Biden, wracked with guilt talks to the  dead voters  who were put on those ballots. He thanks them for helping him to steal the US elections and permanently damage democracy in America by perverting the entire system fraudulently,” Dominic Goldfeign, a ghost hunter from Arlington, Virginia revealed.
Biden’s wife also confirms the story.
“Every night before I put Joe into his  cupboard  where he stands until the morning staring into space, he thanks his imaginary voters as well as the dead people on all his ballot papers. He also thanks all the postal votes with no names on them sent in their millions. The ghosts talk to him as well, he says they are happy to have defrauded the US election system and help him fuck up America.”"

Review of Canadian Comic Zoe Brownstone’s Album ‘Dearly Deported’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46698-review-of-canadian-comic-zoe-brownstones-album-dearly-deported.html,2022,"In  her debut comedy album  Dearly Deported  Toronto born comic Zoe Brownstone introduces herself as a slightly confused but bravely optimistic individual. With an opener that leaves nothing to the imagination about her opinions on living in The Netherlands to her dedication to becoming a well-balanced adult aged stoner, we meet someone who is really seeming to look like she is trying her best to figure it out.
With her quick jabs and timely wit, Zoe brings us along on the journey that brought her to Amsterdam, part cautionary tale, part satirical memoir; we can’t help but laugh at her and feel sorry for her all at the same time. Specifically when detailing the trials of becoming a stepmother and an untimely break-up. But within the series of unfortunate events, Zoe still serves confidence right alongside her questionable choices, a bravado that seemingly comes from nowhere and may not be deserved yet nevertheless is present throughout.
Here is someone we want to win, in Zoe it’s easy to identify pieces of ourselves as she gives us vulnerability for a period long enough to surprise the audience when she delivers a punchline. It’s an indication of her years as a comic on the Toronto scene and more recently helping to grow the English comedy scene in Holland. While this is her debut album, it’s clear she is not new to the craft.
In her material about cannabis use, we get to see a different archetype of the classic ‘stoner’ in the post-prohibition era of her home country. What the new-age stoner thinks about and her relationship to the often naturally anxiety inducing world we live in is insightful to even someone who does not partake. Universal themes of paranoia and self consciousness but in a twisted setting we can both laugh at in the moment and think back to later on (maybe while taking a puff).
This album is raw and fresh, giving us a look at an emerging comic finding her footing. We’re left at the end wondering what’s coming next for Zoe, and somehow having hope because if she can climb out of the (hilarious) hole she’s dug herself then surely we all can."
My Son Hunter – New Film Exposes US Election 2020,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47177-my-son-hunter-new-film-exposes-us-election-2020.html,2022,"Remember the US ELECTION in 2020? Remember the Ashley Biden diary, which revealed how her dad used to have  explicit showers with her when she was a child ? Remember the Hunter Biden videos showing him  smoking crack  and having sex with prostitutes? Well, none of that happened because there was a massive cover-up by the press. It was ghosted/erased/deleted/vapourised from all news desks. The details and news was all covered-up by the social-media sites.
As a result, Joe Biden ‘won’ the election. Amongst all the dead voters who voted Democrat, and the ‘alleged’ mass election fraud that took place…nothing could stop Joe Biden winning the US election. It was written in stone a year before the event, and the vast planning as well as logistics along with gargantuan amounts of money put into the effort of skewing the election, finally paid off.
So, Joe Biden won? Life is great, huh? It all worked out for the better. Sure it did. We are now dealing with an impending global depression, war, hyperinflation, increased poverty for all and a Biden administration who are completely clueless deluded denizens of absolute destruction. Americans who instated Biden into his position of power will regret that fateful decision when circumstances become a lot worse in the future. This is just the beginning.
Would anything be different right now if eternal ‘bad guy’ Trump had won the election in 2022? That doesn’t matter folks, what matters is that the election was skewed because the Hunter Biden stuff was ghosted. That is a form of manipulation, it is a form of electioneering, and it means that in the internet era…democracy does not exist. Search engine results can favour certain news organisations to others, and social media companies can ban or shadow-ban any form of political opposition to their own biased political beliefs.
There is no way any democracy can survive if, through media/internet manipulation and ghosting, the voice of others who relay the truth are silenced? The Democrats will continue doing this over and over again, because it is now a winning formula to skew elections in their favour. They control the main components of the media, and can silence anything or elevate anything they want to adjust public opinion. What will be the point of successive future elections in the future when only one political party has the omnipotent voice?
Yes, it has taken years to achieve this level of control, but it works now more than ever. We are now living in a scary era where democracy is being supplanted by totalitarianism…and it will get a lot worse if these evil, manipulative thieves are allowed to get away with it.
My Son Hunter — it’s low budget, tongue-in-cheek, cheesy, and it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Watch it for fun, even though the underlying truth of the film is a vicious tale of how the West embraced totalitarianism over democracy in the end."

If it was not for my intervention when I was 11-years-old women’s rights would be still in the Stone Age. I am such a brilliant, wonderful person. I am also very clever and intelligent, and I am beautiful. I am the epitome of brilliance, and I shine a light into the world with all my amazing words.
“I thoroughly enjoyed talking about myself for over an hour and wanted to show the world that it’s not all about others, but it is about me, myself and I.
“I want to help young women to be as empowered as I am. If you can stay awake for more than a minute after I start speaking about myself and spouting woke word salad diarrhoea from my well-used mouth. This is not just about me, but about my dedication to myself.”

Meghan Markle Tears For Lost Netflix Queen Opportunities,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47390-meghan-markle-tears-for-lost-netflix-queen-opportunities.html,2022,"One thing that struck most genuine mourners during the Queen’s prolonged funeral ceremony was the sight of Meghan Markle supposedly weeping for the Queen.
Here was a calculating grifter who doesn’t move a finger unless it is worth her while supposedly crying for the dead Queen. Some people were actually fooled by this display, but the majority of folk saw it for what it really was.
“Meghan Markle only cries for herself. Here was a calculating narcissistic grifter who had ordered Harry to ghost the Queen despite the couple being in Britain for their impromptu Netflix visit. She was constantly playing the Queen for a fool, causing the regent great heartache. She would use her children as weapons to get what she wanted, and wilfully withheld contact with the ageing monarch to hurt her for what Meghan perceived she had done wrong. Even though Harry adored his grandma, he was ordered by the harridan to stay away from her and William. Prince Charles even offered a meeting during the most recent visit before the Queen’s death, but Meghan ordered Harry to ghost his own dad as well. She does not understand how these things can be so hard for people with genuine feelings, as Meghan has never had a genuine feeling in her life. Her black, cold heart is only there for monetary success and the acquisition of power,” Rupert Fetherington-Smythe, a celebrated royal historian and commentator, revealed on  Sky News .
Meghan’s tears were therefore for herself, as usual. With the death of the Queen, she has lost multiple opportunities to be filmed with a kind old lady who she manipulated with ease in her advancing years.
Netflix executives were scrambling to somehow repair the damage to the ill-fated nonsensical series they had been duped into dishing out millions of dollars, as the sudden death of the Queen means there may be some serious changes to the royal family now that King Charles III is in charge."
An Ode to the Old Gley Whistle Test 1975,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45934-an-ode-to-the-old-gley-whistle-test-1975.html,2022,"These were the days of quietly spoken bearded presenters wearing woolly jumpers positioned to the far side of the screen. The presenter in question was of course Bob Harris, and the show was the Old Grey Whistle Test, but as a homage to the Japanese band performing, a stagehand had changed the R to an L.
The seventies, eighties and parts of the nineties actually had real musicians performing music with actual melody as well as skill. These days there is no such thing celebrated as musicianship but template music created by the thousand every year on the same linear software as everyone else. The charts today are filled with nothing but repetitive banal detritus, R’n’B, autotune lyrics where everyone sounds the same, and no musical skill whatsoever is required to release a track into the sewer that is the charts these days.
The Sadistic Mika Band certainly did not conform to anything that is around today, and in 1975 were as tight as a nun’s chuff when it came down to musicality. The singer Mika Fukui sauntered onto stage just before the second song began, carrying a Polaroid camera. She casually snapped away at the band as they played before shimmying around sexily. The Sadistic Mika Band received the sadistic part in their name from the singer herself, as she had the propensity to blurt out certain hard truths to people without even thinking about what she said.
Masayoshi Takanaka is a celebrated guitarist in Japan still to this day, but unfortunately the real Mika disappeared into obscurity some time during the eighties."
‘Compassionate’ Meghan Markle Ignores Her Dying Father in Hospital,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45974-compassionate-meghan-markle-ignores-her-dying-father-in-hospital.html,2022,"One would think, if you constantly virtue signal to the press and public about your ‘compassionate’ nature, that you would at least show some of that same fake compassion to your own father in hospital suffering after a stroke.
Naturally, the real emotion of compassion does not apply to Meghan Markle and the staunch shunning of her own father, Thomas Markle is the shameful result.
Psychologist Johann Brandt reveals an analysis of Meghan Markle’s ‘compassion’: “It is immediately evident that Meghan Markle is not a compassionate person, but is instead a person who pretends to be compassionate to increase her narcissistic standing. Psychopathy comes in many forms, and Meghan is an analytical hard-edged celebrity fame machine who deliberately married a royal purely to increase her celebrity status and power. Psychopath’s cannot feel real feelings like other humans, they can only mimic emotion. As Meghan mimics her fake love for Harry, who she is using, she also is attempting to  copy Princess Diana  and her charitable endeavours during her life. Meghan used her father to get ahead in show business and once she used him up and reached her pinnacle with Prince Harry she dumped her own father. This is another psychopathic trait, where people are used and believe they are being loved by the psychopath, but when the psychopath has used up all of the mark’s resources they move on to the next mark without even a whisper. There is no feeling and remorse and after countless people are used up by this narcissistic schizoid psychopath she moves from one person to the next seamlessly. She dares not revisit her dying father in hospital because of one single reason, she cannot feel real compassion and this problem would reveal her real character: a cold, heartless, narcissistic, power mad psychopath.”
Meghan Markle’s father is currently in a hospital, only two and a half hours drive from Meghan’s Montecito mansion. In Meghan’s dark callous mind, the hospital is a million miles away, or simply does not exist.
The treatment of her own father is definite proof that Meghan Markle does not feel compassion for him or any other global cause she claims to champion."

New Star Wars Character Rashee Sanook Unveiled,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48172-new-star-wars-character-rashee-sanook-unveiled.html,2022,"Joe Biden apparently collaborated with the Star Wars producers and director to create a new character for the upcoming film. The character is called Rashee Sanook and will be a feature character in the latest Disney woke extravaganza.
Star Wars reveal
“We got the idea for the character’s name while invited for a curry at the White House with Joe Biden. As I was eating my chapati and vindaloo, Biden was talking about some dude in the UK. He said the name ‘Rashee Sanook’ and immediately a bulb went off in my head. We were looking for a character name all day, and it took a senile old corrupt creepy fool like Biden to come up with it. I chomped down on another onion bhaji and as the grease made its way down my chin I had the biggest fuckin’ smile on my face,” Star Wars director, Jeb Steingelt revealed to  Hollywood Week  magazine.
Star Wars fans were going wild at the new character reveal prior to the new film release in 2024.
“Oh man, this new Star Wars character really hit me. I especially love his greasy hair, and his red bud spot in the middle of his forehead. According to the data Rashee Sanook hails from the Gupta system but now lives in Mos Espa peddling lies to the residents for big sums of money. He serves the Empire and answers directly to Darth Bawbag on the Death Star.”
The latest putrid woke soulless Disney Star Wars film will be revealed in 2024."

Saturation Kills Everything,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51338-saturation-kills-everything.html,2023,"I magine a time when there was only one TV station, only a few radio stations and the odd cinema blockbuster. Buying a vinyl record of your favourite band from a shop made your entire universe, at a concentrated level, you dedicated your entire attention to every nuance, every tiny detail of this piece of music consisting of about six tracks on each side. Even the album cover and sleeve notes, and back cover were pored over. You actually enjoyed, and were genuinely thrilled by whatever you were listening to on the record.
This was the ultimate point of music distribution simply because the listener had such little choice, their attention was entirely dedicated to only what was chosen to be released and these mere morsels of creativity activated the listener entirely. For record companies and artists, that was the apex of the entire history of music.
The same could be applied to those great moments of cinema, where historically defining films were shown to audiences for the first time. There was no internet of things where entire catalogues of films are downloaded or streamed in seconds.
The same applies to books, because the brains of those of the era were not addled with complete mental saturation from all quarters, there was instead clarity in thought, and space to ruminate, space in time where silence was part of the fabric of not only creativity but of appreciation of art in all its forms.
Saturation overkill is the realm of today, where the human brain has been rewired with an attention span of maybe less than two seconds. Just like saturation bombing over Dresden during WW2 killed literally hundreds of thousands of German civilians overnight; so too is there a saturation onslaught on the human brain today. There is no time for the listener to listen because he has to switch over to the next song that is even better, or for whatever reason he has been programmed to almost listen to something whilst watching another thing and twiddling on his phone simultaneously.
Saturation kills stardom, it kills fame, and music personas these days are not revered as the true stars were in the past. There is no real fame anymore, and the numbers do not mean shit. Getting 900 million gazillion listens or views do not mean anything in a world of saturation, simply because many people did not actually listen, and many companies can buy bots by the billion to exact fake views/listens.
Saturation of everything in a mish mash deadly soup of bullshit all dumped into your brain at once is what today is, and it has rendered nearly everything as meaningless. Saturation of analysis kills the magic of art, but today everything is overanalysed and YouTube analysis videos saturate everything, killing the mystique and artistry of what was once a magical piece of artistic expression for someone. Everything, is now a throwaway item simply to be discarded and replaced by another momentary piece of shit. Even the good old stuff, pre-internet, is now discarded and a mere moment in time.
Saturation of news, and entertainment and porn, and all the other shit that goes with every genre, every keyword, and every known piece of knowledge eventually amounts to nothing much, and there you are constantly flicking from one thing to the next, your attention span is now less than a millisecond, and you do not know who you are anymore, or who you were, and you ingest all these things the propagandists tell you to do, they say you are woke, so you are woke now. You don’t even know what it means or why, but you follow blindly because you have been programmed to do so. Through repetition, through saturation bombing of each individual, each group, you do not have a sense of concrete mind anymore, they have changed the wiring in your brain permanently. You are addicted to all of this and you cannot stop. No one will ever know and experience those beautiful time filled pre-internet days ever again."
Now AI is Creating Perfectly Indistinguishable Death Metal Music,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51306-now-ai-is-creating-perfectly-indistinguishable-death-metal-music.html,2023,"Only a few months ago if you tried to train AI software to replicate and create a piece of heavy metal music, the result would have been a sub-par mish-mash of nonsense and un-listenable machine noise. That is until the people behind the Orc band, the Frostbite Orckings worked on their project and came up with the song ‘Guardians of Time’ which has even been featured in a Metal Hammer podcast.
These are truly scary times we are living in. Soon, AI may come up with something that Beethoven or Mozart would have been proud of in musicality and composition.
The Frostbite Orckings are frankly much more musical and play with distinct clarity than most human ‘death metal’ bands around today.
The power chords coming from this monstrous tune at the  beginning of the song  were pure metal, as was the video, which was amusing to watch. Obviously, the video was created by humans to complement the music, however soon we will witness AI completed videos as well, no doubt!

Harry and Meghan Plan on Wearing Silly Costumes to King Charles Coronation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51377-harry-and-meghan-plan-on-wearing-silly-costumes-to-king-charles-coronation.html,2023,"Insiders within the Harry and Meghan circle are discussing a plan to disrupt and upstage King Charles III and Queen Camilla by wearing silly costumes during the King’s coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in May.
According to insiders, the pesky duo, who are a serious thorn in the side to The Firm, will appear from a pink carriage drawn by a set of South African wart hogs. When the carriage stops at Westminster Abbey, Harry and Meghan will alight from the carriages wearing their costumes and go to their seats on all fours whooping like hyenas.
The carriage holding the deranged couple is currently being shipped over from Coney Island, USA.
Artist Josh Neuhart, who designed the carriage spent over eight months painting and constructing the Harry and Meghan extravaganza.
“It’s absolutely fabulous, we have these garish LED lights all over the canopy, and the pièce de résistance is a group of massive spotlights and glitter bombs shooting off everywhere. Ejaculating over the crowds resplendently. During the procession, loudspeakers will hail the crowd with cheap pop music from Beyonce, and rapper Jay Z and a group of midgets will throw copies of Prince Harry’s new book into the baying British crowds.”
All of this will of course be filmed by a massive team of approximately 200 Netflix film crew following each moment as it happens.
If this does not upstage King Charles and his Queen, the Montecito couple will be shouting random Tourette’s style words out during the ceremony, as well as whistling and grunting like farm animals."

And question power structures of every sort. 
I claim to be a lefty or at least vaguely pink 
But in truth, I’ve tranquillised myself with centrist groupthink.
‘Be sceptical and questioning,’ I tell my students loud, 
While of the fact I’ve never been, I’m oddly proud. 
I cite radical scholars, but can’t escape the fact 
I’m a chicken-shit conformist liberal technocratic twat.
I’ll wear a rainbow lanyard for the LGBTs, 
And spout banalities about diversity. 
But that’s all just careerist masturbation, 
For I don’t care about our uni’s links to corporations:
Racist ones, imperialist ones, sexist ones, they say, 
And investments from despots who oppress the gays. 
But to get yourself some juicy great research grants 
You’ve got to suck up to all those murderous c…
…Can’t you see that propositions need no evidence? 
That the best form of offence is sitting on the fence? 
I promise you there’s nothing at all defective
About strongly feeling Keir Starmer is effective.
I’ll babble my bromides about austerity, 
But when it comes to striking, I’ll plead poverty.

Where geniuses rule… remember Ed Balls? 
But if loony lefties stand around chantin’ 
I’ll gladly reap the benefits of their collective bargain.

‘Cos unlike Iraq and Yemen – there’s someone else to blame. 
I’ve got a ‘love’ emoji for the refugees, 
But not the ones who got that way from our brutality.
Two hours later, I’ve changed my pic to the stars

‘Cos apart from drowning migrants and looting the Global South 
Brussels is perfect – I heard it from Blair’s mouth!
Oh, I claim to treat all sources critically, 
But the BBC and  Guardian  I trust completely. 
That’s tantamount to drilling a hole in my bonce 
And filling it with bullshit right up to the top.
Oh I hate fake news, disinformation, 
All of it comes from non-Western nations. 
Russia and China must be blamed for everything, 
Brexit, Trump, UKIP, especially Corbyn.

I heard it on  Andrew Marr , so it must be true. 
He lied about the Tories’ plan for NHS-beating. 
That’s accurate ‘cos it came from Wes Streeting.

That’s justified because we’re nicer than them; 
We’d never lock our enemies up in some nasty pen.
Never mind Mr Assange – that story’s stale! 
And forget 2 million Blacks in American jails. 
Let’s only fret about those Uyghur lives 
And not about our slaughters since 1585.
See, I’ve always had a rather fuzzy moral perspective, 
Even though you needn’t be a genius detective 
To know Blair killing a million overseas 
Is hardly better than Tory deaths from Covid-19.

But it’s undermined by my hypocrisy. 
See, I’m all for voting parliamentary 
But totally opposed to it inside HE.
I marched against Thatcher in the eighties, 
But now I use her language in my spreadsheets. 
Everything’s a ‘business case’, a ‘strategic conversation’, 
When we sack a whole department, it’s called ‘rationalisation’.
‘Cos it’s just easier to quote-tweet J.K. Rowling 
Than devise original transphobic growling. 
I think I’m being edgy, but in truth I’m far from that: 
I’m a chicken-shit conformist liberal technocratic twat.
While I claim to be a rationalist, I’m immune to proof 
And can’t get my head around this simple truth: 
Online, I rant and rave about Tory capers,

Brain Damage: Elon Musk Versus Mark Zuckerberg Cage Fight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52609-brain-damage-elon-musk-versus-mark-zuckerberg-cage-fight.html,2023,"Some people would say some of these characters already have brain damage, but all kidding aside, repeated blows to the skull in a cage fight between the two billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg could increase the levels of brain damage.
Most boxers and MMA fighters receive a considerable amount of brain damage during their careers and fights. Repetitive hits to the head increase the risk of long-term neurologic conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitive and behaviour problems and parkinsonism.
This is why it would actually be highly entertaining to see two billionaires, who have supposedly used their brains so well to create such great wealth, beat themselves to a pulp for an audience.
“Personally, I would enjoy watching a match where Zuckerberg becomes a  vegetable  afterwards. Here is this robotic guy who has a huge brain having it smacked around his skull at great speed. Sure, he’s not a career fighter, but permanent brain damage only needs one or two heavy blows to the skull. Depending on the force of the hits to the skull, the mighty Zuck could easily become as useful in the brain department as a piece of fucking celery. What happens to his empire then? No more Instagram or Facebook. Let’s look on the positive side here,” a man at a bus stop commented.
Elon Musk said Friday that his much-hyped cage fight with Mark Zuckerberg would take place in Italy, as authorities there confirmed talks about hosting a “great charity event.”
More billionaires need to get into the ring to beat the living shit out of each other. For entertainment purposes, it just does not get better than this."
Experts Disclose What Paris Hilton’s Feet Reveal,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52771-experts-disclose-what-paris-hiltons-feet-reveal.html,2023,"Experts at the Foot Environmental Exponentiation Think-Tank (FEETT) have been studying the phenomenon of Paris Hilton’s feet for the past 20 years.
Professor Inglebight Mannering, leading researcher for the FEETT institute, is not a renowned foot fetishist but a scientist who has truly got to grip with Paris Hilton’s size 15 feet.
“Just look at those bulbous toes, the bone structure is truly astounding. Her big toe alone could injure a small dog, you know, like a Chihuahua or some other toy breed. We are fascinated by such aberrations, especially amongst the female species. Our findings after much analysis and recording data from over 20,000 subjects is that Paris Hilton most certainly has a huge vagina, like a vast cavern. From our records, we found a viable correlation between foot length and girth to vagina size. Our estimation, without physical corroboration, would be that the subject’s vagina is over 25″ in depth and approximately 14″ wide.”
Paris Hilton’s feet certainly do stick out, as the celebrity has been known to squash little dogs when she clomps around Beverly Hills.
One woman walking her Shih Tzu in 2018 revealed that Paris Hilton had just walked out of a shoe shop and, without noticing, squashed her dog with her enormous foot.
“I was about to walk into the shoe shop when I heard a crunching sound and a yelp. I looked down, and an enormous foot had squashed my little Mimi. Paris Hilton looked down and started to wipe the bloody mess off her large stiletto and complained that she had just had those shoes delivered specially hand made from Italy. She threw me a wad of twenties for my dog, and stormed off, wiping her shoe all the way to her Bentley. Naturally, I was outraged, but I forgive her because she is a celebrity,” Angela Multhrope, a Beverly Hills resident, revealed.
There are positives though for Paris Hilton’s condition, for example giving birth will be no problem. She will probably not even notice the baby coming out, especially with such a huge vagina. Other positives are that if she needs to hide a large object fast, she can do so in her large cavernous hole, especially good for jail time and shoplifting."

Feminists Now Want “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” Banned,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53032-feminists-now-want-austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me-banned.html,2023,"Puritan, psychotic misandrist 5th Wave feminists now want the wonderful comedy film “Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me” permanently banned and all copies of the movie burned on a bonfire along with every man on the planet’s testicles.
“SHAG”
“It is a disgusting carnal misogynistic film where Austin Powers shags his way through multiple female spies and the worst part of it is that this horrid man says the word ‘shag’!” a feminist member of establishment media news revealed.
Caught in the middle of this debacle is GB News who claims to be a news company that is not part of the ‘establishment’ but actually are part of the establishment and have turned into a puritan edifice of hyper-sensitive politically correct sewage infested shit piles of inequity. A sad turn of affairs, as they once had some modicum of reasonable promise.
“As is the case with establishment news organisations and media who are pandering to wokism and 5th wave feminists, the core of this problem comes down to the advertisers and woke companies, who dictate everything. The advertising agencies have all now gone extreme woke and are invariably tied to their  ESG  scores and the WEF. This sort of soviet political correctness and puritanism is a direct influence from the pieces of shit who run advertising agencies these days. These ad companies are now run by stasi virtue-signalling woke arseholes who pander to ESG obsessed companies that commission ads from their companies. Any form of un-woke naughtiness on a media company that shows ads is now completely cancelled. Wokism as a weaponised soviet censorship system thus limits the scope of human expression and commerce. Every advert created today is an abhorrent travesty and insult to the original concept of advertising, and a fucking disgrace,” a former advertising executive from the 90s revealed.
The Spy Who Shagged Me
Well, there it is. You cannot say the word ‘shag’ anymore, you cannot say you want to shag a woman, or inversely you cannot say you don’t want to shag a feminist ideology spouting woman.
No more shagging for Austin Powers, either…looks like Dr. Evil really did win in the end…"
Why ‘Toxic’ Indiana Jones Had to be Ruined,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52348-why-toxic-indiana-jones-had-to-be-ruined.html,2023,"The latest and hopefully final desecration of Indiana Jones, a wholesale hero to millions of film fans across the globe, was sadly a necessity within today’s horrible culture. Men, are the enemy in today’s society, and everything they do must be depreciated and negated. Therefore, it was inevitable that our heroic archaeologist Indiana Jones would fall victim to the anti-male hatred that is so prevalent in today’s dystopian nightmare society.
In the horrible socialist, hyper sensitive times we are living in, anything that does not follow strict propaganda guidelines or cultural Marxist ideology is labelled as ‘toxic’. Indiana Jones’ past escapades have thus come up for review, and surprise, surprise — old Indiana Jones is now deemed as ‘toxic’ by the intolerant leftist former liberals who are now staunch communists. Indy must have his entire career ruined, and be retired in disgrace for his previous adventures.
Having a cock and balls, testosterone and leaping over bottomless pits with nothing but a hat and whip are serious no-nos in a culture that has been hijacked by feminazis, gay supremacists, hysterical doomsday eco-cultists, African American fascists and trans  hactivists , all funded and promoted by the big money at the top of the chain.
Please do not pay to watch this film, as you will feel truly ashamed of yourself for helping to fund such a piece of utter detritus. The film is not a good farewell to Indy, it is a sickening burial of a hero many have watched over the years. It is hard to understand how such a terrible pointless film could have ever been passed to be made, but it seems Hollywood has absolutely no quality standards anymore, and are entrenched in a deadly suicide dive poisoned by severely toxic political propaganda.
First of all, who is the fucking kid? He is useless, and plonked in solely as a brown token. The Nazi guy is clearly a racist when he is speaking to the hotel waiter, however his team somehow hired an irritating black woman. How probable is it that CIA Nazis in the 1960s would hire a black woman in their team of Aryan supremacists for diversity purposes? The film is one muddled contradiction after another, and the lazy, hackneyed script is a messy drip of diarrhoea from Kathleen Kennedy’s putrid gaping anus. As for the god-daughter of Indy, we have the celebrated British actress, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her furiously large pear shaped mole, who is destined by studio executives to take over from Indiana Jones in subsequent films. Well, good luck to her, however this may result in even more people not going to see any of the films in the future.
With an enormous $350 million production budget (not including $280 million marketing budget) for frankly a very mediocre, banal film that has none of the previous magic of the first three movies, we can easily surmise that this will be another serious loss for Disney and Lucas film. The first three Indiana Jones films might as well be deleted from the Disney catalogue, because this awful monstrosity destroys everything from those previous classics.
Sadly, the way that Western society has deteriorated to be supposedly ‘inclusive’ is a fabricated lie — it is in fact a harsh, intolerant exclusive censorship-driven curly cunt hair of dystopian Marxist lunacy that is now too far gone to ever redeem itself.
Maybe Putin letting those missiles fly to finish everything off would actually be a delightful relief for billions of people."
Exclusive: Harry and Meghan Reveal Where They Will Move Next,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52504-exclusive-harry-and-meghan-reveal-where-they-will-move-next.html,2023,"Harry and Meghan, the wayward drifters and grifters who have fooled simple Americans into thinking they are somehow important, even fooling Spotify executives to hand over $19 million, are said to be unhappy in their 16 bathroom Montecito faux palace (McMansion).
Ovid Scoobie, the couple’s spokesperson, has revealed on his blog that the duo are house hunting in a place that not many have considered.
“I can happily announce that my beloved dear couple, Harry and Meghan will be moving to Iraq in the Fall. They have already secured a 20 bathroom place directly in the Sunni Triangle, in Baghdad. On a recent trip to the area, the couple immediately fell in love with the place, and it even has a large torture chamber in the basement. You know, if they catch a paparazzo, or maybe they can use it to torture contracts out of Netflix executives.”
On further inspection, reporters for the Sun revealed that the building was formerly a secret palace for Uday Hussein, one of Saddam’s evil sons, before he was killed in a shoot-out.
“There is faux gold furniture everywhere, and when Meghan saw that she squealed in abject delight, because as a fake personality herself, she adores fake things. The bullet holes in the walls can easily be plastered over and the deceased individuals in the torture chamber will be dumped in the street where the stray dogs will clean everything up,” Scoobie added.
Harry and Meghan of course want the best for their kids and when they saw the Sunni Triangle they immediately fell in love with the place. There are plenty of opportunities for kids to play and be educated in the local religious schools. What used to be called IED Alley by the U.S. troops is now a pleasant dusty road with gutted out Hummers and downed Blackhawk choppers. This is where all the Iraqi children play now, and sometimes they dig up a treasure trove of articles left behind by the Americans. Only last week, a group of children uncovered an M60 machine gun and cache of grenades. It was fireworks time for those kids.
The Sunni Triangle zone has plenty of amenities and opportunities for family fun. Every May, is the starting of shooting season, where indiscriminate sectarian mass shootings occur. In this free-for-all, many are severely or fatally injured, but it’s all part of the fun of the area. Since the Americans left Iraq, the level of anarchy has increased by over 80% and kidnappings are a daily activity many criminal gangs and jihadists subscribe to.
It’s a long way from Montecito or Windsor, but it will do for now."
A Beautiful Moment to Lighten Up Your Day,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52528-a-beautiful-moment-to-lighten-up-your-day.html,2023,"Sometimes it’s good to share a delightful clip or two on the internets, and this is what we are doing today on the Squib. This is a beautiful moment in time, encapsulated in glorious detail, that will have you smiling all day.
The joyous episode was captured somewhere in California, a state run by people who pass silly laws that benefit no one, and contribute to the misery of millions of folks who are unfortunate enough to live there. These idiots even plan on bringing out a new law which will make it  illegal to stop shoplifters .
To see instances of such immediate justice meted out with such fervour is truly a glorious beauteous sight, and even though there will be many ‘progressives’ or should we call the pompous arseholes ‘regressives’, who will not appreciate the sheer beauty and passion of this moment and will whimper into their handkerchiefs — fuck them."
Why Rappers Wear Chains,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60314-why-rappers-wear-chains.html,2025,"Rappers often wear gold chains with large pendants as a symbol of their success and wealth, as is this rapper eating fried chicken in the middle of a road.
As the cars drive by, he revels in his success as a rapper in the world of rap music.
It is a highly idealistic lifestyle for African Americans, and exemplifies their status in black high society.
Why do rappers wear chains?
Rappers wear jewellery to flex, show off their wealth, and make a spectacle of their disposable income.
They also wear jewellery to commemorate, money, greed, low morality, laziness, sexual perversion, drugs, and crime which are all things celebrated by rappers.
In fact, the more  vulgar  the display of their chains and jewellery, the higher the status they assume within the black community.
“I’m not certain what type of metal the gentleman in the video is wearing as a chain around his neck, but I could safely guess it is possibly faux gold-plated. If he were to get the metal wet, and it turned green, this would confirm my hypothesis. It’s perfectly fine to wear fake jewellery, many of my rapper clients like to fake it because everything is out on loan, or they simply trash their money away as soon as they get some cash,” Ron Goldberg, an Atlanta jeweller revealed after viewing the video of the rapper."
Alternative Script For Tarantino Last Film May Never Materialise,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55505-alternative-script-for-tarantino-last-film-may-never-materialise.html,2024,"A film script that could have been the crowning glory of film-maker Quentin Tarantino’s last ever film will probably never see the light of the cinema screen. The writer of the original script has revealed that the sci-fi film idea “would have delighted Tarantino”.
Speaking to us outside the WME agency offices near London’s Oxford Street, the elusive writer of the script revealed some details about the proposed film.
“Tarantino has delved into pretty much every film genre, but he has not touched science fiction, which with his immaculate approach and talent would be the crowning glory to his career. This is what I have here, it is the most amazing fucking script I have written, but sadly Tarantino will never get to read it, adjust it, play with it, and film it.
“How the fuck do you make your final film to top off the  masterpieces  you made previously? That’s the 200 million dollar question that no one dares to bring up.”
So why will this so-called ‘amazing’ script never get to Tarantino?
“I’ll tell you fucking why. I’m a nobody. I just got thrown out of the WME offices head fuckin’ first. No one wants to speak to me, and Quentin’s agent is completely inaccessible. When everything, every damn door is closed off to new talent, and new creative ideas, no wonder Hollywood is in such trouble and drowning in morose crap. You see this script, it’s going in the fuckin’ shredder!”
The frustrated writer then walked down the road, forever gone."
Evil Villain Takes Over James Bond,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60475-evil-villain-takes-over-james-bond.html,2025,"An extremely mischievous and deviously evil villain has taken over James Bond and sort of left the British Intelligence agency in a spot of bother.
The criminal mastermind with aspirations of world domination, who is the arch-enemy of British MI6 agent James Bond, has vowed to take all semblance of Britishness out of MI6 and poor old Bond himself and Americanize everything.
Birthed out of a burlap bag somewhere in Albuquerque in 1964, James Bond villain Bezos is head of a global criminal organisation called  Amazon  and is commonly referred to by the codename Number 1 within this organisation.
The ultimate James Bond villain of villains, Bezos holds some nasty plans for global domination, involving saturating the globe with cheap Chinese made trinkets that break after a week of use.
One could postulate that the Americans have already bastardized the franchise with Jason Bourne, a version of Bond on steroids, but are not happy with just that, now they want one of the last things the Brits actually own — James Bond.
As for Agent Brad Bond, codename 007-Eleven, he surfs more than he spies, calls every villain “dude,” and replaces the classic martini with a Big Gulp. His catchphrase will no doubt be, “Yo, shaken or stirred—whatever, bruh.”
His gadgets include a vape that doubles as a laser, flip-flops with built-in X-ray vision, and a self-parking monster truck, all acquired from Amazon Prime.
The CIA keeps trying to brief him, but he’s always “catching some sick waves, bruh.”
Mission reports? “Yeah, so like, the bad guy was all ‘I’m taking over the world,’ and I was like ‘nah, man,’ so I, y’know, handled it. Anyway, who’s up for tacos?”
Naturally, the American Bond will be as subtle as a brick, forget about sneaking into the lair of the bad guy like the British Bond, this guy will simply kick the front door down and shoot everything in sight including pets, staff, Mexican gardeners, visiting relatives and girl scouts selling cookies.
Fuck caviar and foie gras, a sloppy grease laden double bacon cheeseburger with extra fries and a huge tub of coke will suffice.
Debonair charm? Nah, the American Bond will straightaway grab women by the pussy, and drop his drawers ready for action. Fuck you, I’m American Bond, I own all y’all!

Gay Couple Who Married in Paris Suing Venue Over Profiteroles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60598-gay-couple-who-married-in-paris-suing-venue-over-profiteroles.html,2025,"A gay couple who married at a  Paris  venue are suing the Pirate des Fesses Salon because of the profiteroles, and some of the flower arrangements were out of place.
The couple insist their marriage was ruined when guests started vomiting after eating the profiteroles.
An investigation is still underway to find out what sort of cream was in the profiteroles.
Clyde Bungholle, 34, one of the guests, recalled eating one of the profiteroles and projectile vomiting into a plate full of vol-au-vents.
“I ate the cream in the profiterole, and it tasted like something awful. I then involuntarily vomited into a plate of vol-au-vents. An old lady who was not watching, picked one up with the new filling and ate it with gusto. I tried to tell her, but seeing the delight on her face made me keep my mouth shut.”
Numerous guests vomited after eating the profiteroles, and some even vomited on a few of the bridesmen causing outrage.
The newly married gay couple are suing the venue and its owners for 4,500 euros, and the litigation will be completed at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in April."
Mud Pit to be Installed in Oval Office For Presidential Debates,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60624-mud-pit-to-be-installed-in-oval-office-for-presidential-debates.html,2025,"Great news for fight fans! The White House has proudly announced the installation of a mud pit in the middle of the Oval Office where  presidential debates  will take place.
“We’re thinking of making the events Pay-Per-View because we kinda need the money, you know. Every little thing helps. Have you seen our debt levels? Sheesh. That war in Ukraine sure did not help with that,” president Donald Trump told the assembled reporters in the Oval Office, invited to have a look for themselves.
One reporter from CNN accidentally tripped on her stilettoes and fell into the pit headfirst.
Immediately cheers went up in the Oval Office, as she struggled around in the mud, her shirt coming off revealing a thrilling sight for the assembled onlookers.
“Look at CNN go! Whoah! Thanks for demonstrating how the pit works. Okay, get her a towel, someone,” vice president J.D. Vance quipped.
The assembled members of the press all cheered at the good sport of the reporter as she left to get a much-needed shower.
The Oval Office has become associated in Americans’ minds with the presidency itself through memorable images, such as a young John F. Kennedy, Jr. peering through the front panel of his father’s desk, President Richard Nixon speaking by telephone with the Apollo 11 astronauts during their moonwalk, and Amy Carter bringing her Siamese cat Misty Malarky Ying Yang to brighten her father President Jimmy Carter’s day.
Several presidents have addressed the nation from the Oval Office on occasion. Examples include Kennedy presenting news of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), Nixon announcing his resignation from office (1974), Ronald Reagan following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster (1986), and George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks (2001)."

There’s only a slight problem, the Norwegians did not inform the president of one small factor.
The extra Norwegian spending up to 2% was spent solely on LGBTQP dance classes and woke EU education courses. The Russians must be shitting in their pants right now. Shhh! No one tell the president."

A fucking fruit salad rainbow, cut some fruit and place it onto a fucking platter in someone else’s elaborate, expensive kitchen. Sprinkle a few flower petals on your amazing fruity creation. Et voila, Netflix’s $100 million down the shithole.
Nobody gives a flying fart about this shit, this is so awful it would be preferable to have root canal for four hours straight.
Fake, vacuous syrupy plastic shite devoid of any substance for an overprivileged grifter with a serious chip on her fucking shoulder. In fact, the chip is so big soon she’s going to need a wheelbarrow for it.
Who wants to watch a bunch of greasy sycophantic Californian “Oh my gawd” bootlicking paid puppets fawning over some z-list celebrity just because they got compensated with shitloads of wonger? Do these people have any fucking dignity? It seems Meghan Markle doesn’t have any dignity herself.
And that awful ghey music they play in the background is truly sickening, who the fuck chose that crap? That’s the shitty music you hear on Mark Zuckerberg Meta presentations with the ukuleles and whistling. It’s better to ram some sharpened pencils into your ears.
Watch it for a laugh, give it your full support because  Netflix will lose more subscribers  for pushing this dire trash. They’re having a laugh at the expense of paying subscribers by presenting them with such gauche saccharine excrement. This show is actually sad, it’s disgraceful in its flaunting of wealth 99% of people will never see or experience in their lives. It’s a disgusting display, showing off something like this Meghan Markle malarkey when there are millions of people really struggling to live their lives under seriously hard economic circumstances. This just makes people detest her with even more vehemence and vitriol.
What this atrocious pampered narcissist needs to do is bring in a kid from the ghetto into that kitchen and feed them some beans or some ham hock, and forget about sprinkling the motherfucking flowers over the food or presenting the poor kid with flowers inside ice cubes.
Wow! I never knew that you can arrange fruit on a plate! $100 million for that? Nice work if you can get it. Oh, and where’s dumbo? Go back home and take some of that jam and rub it over your smug, self-absorbed face whilst crying like a baby. You failed.

After sending a sum of $1,200 to the address, the supposed Queen of Nigeria followed up with an additional “small request” of $25,000 to cover “unforeseen circumstances regarding a feud with the British royal family”. The man complied, then never heard back from the scammer.

Naturally, the vindictive Meghan Markle and her  attack poodle  have created a hornets nest of nastiness and put the Windsors in the direct line of fire for the race-baiters to take pot shots.
Scientifically speaking, the baby skin colour from mixed race couples can be a fascinating subject involving many genetic variables that not only determine colouring of the skin but colour of the eyes and hair of the child.
Piers Morgan has revealed the names of the royals accused of the silly crime of simply asking a question during his latest show, which was a response to a Dutch ‘ printing error ‘ involving the latest sordid atrocity by Omid Scobie.

Indeed, patience with the Sussexes is drying up in America, and even staunch former fans of the couple are dumping the duplicitous duo and their nasty attacks on the royal family. Whilst the Windsors exude an air of dignity, duty and royal class, Harry and Meghan exude an air of desperation, vulgarity and parasitic nastiness.
Endgame
King Charles recently stated that he would not take away the  royal titles  away from the two miscreants despite their constant attacks, and we can only assume that either the king is extremely weak, or he is worried about other pieces of royal secrets that Harry and Meghan would release.

Labour War on Private Schools: “Hogwarts May be Forced to Close”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56276-labour-war-on-private-schools-hogwarts-may-be-forced-to-close.html,2024,"Comrade Starmer and his Marxist Labour Muggles are so intent on  ruining  private schools by taxing school fees, that the famous wizard school where Harry Potter and his chums attended could be forced to close as well, the Daily Prophet newspaper has revealed. The Labour war on private schools and Hogwarts is really heating up.
“This is Muggle persecution gone mad” screams one of the headlines from the Daily Prophet.
Many wizarding parents have also chimed in to the outrage by writing in their concerns.
Argus Mendacious a parent of two Hogwarts pupils, Jenny, 12, and Rodney, 14, went absolutely ballistic upon hearing the news from the Muggle Marxist shisters Labour and their useless war on private schools.
“Just because these Labour Muggles and squibs think it will bring in more money so they can spend it all on black hole socialist tin-pot money pit projects and bloated Big State salaries, they have no bloody idea what they are doing. Hogwarts is an institution that educates the next generation of wizards and is crucial to keeping the equilibrium between our magical world and the Muggle world. If Hogwarts goes, guess who wins? Yes, it will be Voldemort and the dastardly Malfoys.”
Indeed, this Muggle Labour mess plays right into the hands of Voldemort, who many suspect is behind all of this chicanery.
Gryffindor to the rescue
Nelson Huffapup, a recently graduated wizard from Gryffindor, chimed in with a solid plan to somehow avert certain destruction for the school of magic.
“I say we all concentrate on Comrade Starmer and blast him with Obliviate. If enough of us do it at the same time, he will be given a magical lobotomy, and he won’t even know his name or where he is. If any other Labour Party muggle tries anything, we do the same to them. Obliviate and then the banishing charm Depulso.”
Hogwarts’ illustrious history
The wonderful and very private magical school, Hogwarts was founded around the 9th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin.
Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches, as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution.
Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles."
Why Disney Needs to Continue Making Projects Like “The Acolyte”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56467-why-disney-needs-to-continue-making-projects-like-the-acolyte.html,2024,"Star Wars fans, and film critics, have recently been raging about the latest preachy woke presentation full of shit production called “The Acolyte”. Yes, it was produced, written and directed by the usual suspects who have been ruining Star Wars for decades and are impoverishing Disney year after year with failure after failure. They spent $200 million, not including the marketing budget of an estimated $180 million, fashioning this turd over a four-year period. Disney needs to continue making woke turds like “The Acolyte” so that it eventually goes bankrupt. Continue spewing out preachy vomit chunks series after series until nothing is left. Let them do it. Cheer them on.
The problem here is, all power to Disney. If they want to ruin Star Wars and bankrupt their woke Marxist infiltrated company, let them do it. They are obviously completely blind to what they are doing, do not care about Star Wars fans or viewers, do not care about making a profit and are completely indoctrinated by identity politics pushing a Negroid LGBTQP+ agenda that is frankly disturbing.
Don’t react to them, they love your negative reaction
Don’t be outraged by The Acolyte, because this is what they want. Disney and the vile Marxists who have infiltrated the company are actually empowered by the reaction of Star Wars fans, who are predominantly male. This is affirmation to them. Kathleen Kennedy and her acolytes probably congregate in a cave somewhere wearing cloaks and sing lesbian witch songs about the “power of the many” in true collectivist style to celebrate killing off the franchise.
The key to all of this dear Star Wars fans is that you have to ignore it all. You must acknowledge the fact the original force of Star Wars is now long forgotten, it went to sleep when the idiot George Lucas stupidly sold the rights to Disney and gave Bob Iger/Kathleen Kennedy the reins.
Rotten Tomatoes gives The Acolyte a 14% audience score. This is a good thing, it shows that many people are ignoring it and actually waking up to the nonsense. This is a step in the right direction. If you want to sate your Star Wars appetite, you must now only look backwards to the pre-Disney days. Yes, this will limit you somewhat, but at least it will be Star Wars and not something else.
Agitprop
The putrid criminals who have violated and vandalised the franchise have forgotten about Star Wars, their sole agenda is to push a narrative of extreme feminist supremacy, LGBTQP, communism, racial hatred towards what they see as toxic white males. Plot lines, acting, yadda yadda yadda are all non concerns for the invading parasites who took over Star Wars.
You see,  wokism is not able to create anything new , it is like a parasite that burrows into a previously established thing and eventually kills it. They tried it with  Cleopatra , they have been succeeding with Star Wars. They successfully killed off  Indiana Jones .
Boycott is the only way — ignore it
Just forget anything new with the Star Wars name on it, because it is not Star Wars any more, it is something completely subverted, perverted and turned into a slithering smelly shit stain on the arse crack of the universe.
Boycott all new Disney productions, including Star Wars. Do not watch them, do not react to them, and do not even acknowledge their existence, because the producers of these serials and films certainly do not acknowledge your existence. In fact, they hate you, and yet you give them your money. No, do not pay a cent or a penny to them. No more…and it has to stick. It is a great hope that one day the blind wokists in Disney will lose all their money and purchasing power.
Remember, the Force is real, and it’s in the original Star Wars films and fans — not in any of the preachy toxic woke Disney gonorrhoea-ridden puss being ejected from Kathleen Kennedy’s puckered anus of inequity."
Product Review: Montecito Riviera Toilet Paper,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56833-product-review-montecito-riviera-toilet-paper.html,2024,"We love to review  new products  on the market, and this week we received a much anticipated product from Montecito, California. The special product line, toilet paper, is a new toilet paper choice from the Montecito Riviera luxury brand. We enrolled our office boy, Tommy Poppers to review the quadruple ply cushioned sustainably sourced Amazon rainforest toilet paper. Below is his review:
“Last night, went out with the lads for a vindaloo and beers, so when I was called up for this review I literally shat my y-fronts with anticipation. During our curry sesh, I downed twelve pints of watered down piss water beer, and had six shots of tequila. On the way to the car, I thought it would be a good idea to have a kebab. After a brief brawl with a few chavs in the kebab shop, I ordered an extra large doner drizzled with chilli sauce and garlic sauce to take away the taste of the old meat, along with some chips and a saveloy. I also downed six cans of Kestrel super strength from the local Londis, and added to the mix, a bottle of Diamond White chased down with a small bottle of cheap vodka that had no brand name on it.
“Whilst driving home, I felt a rumbling in me stomach, and a sudden sharp pain ominously emanating from my arsehole. That’s when I knew I needed to get home to do a big shit sharpish. The police chased me for a few miles then gave up, as I parked my car in my neighbour’s front garden after the 90 MPH chase. Dashing out of the car door holding my sphincter in, holding on for dear life, I had to navigate somehow through the front door. Not being able to find my keys, I broke the window and entered into the kitchen. It’s possible there was some seepage, as the gurgling and popping noises were getting louder and louder by the second.
“My bog’s on the third floor, so going up the stairs was quite an ordeal and at one point I nearly let go, but clenched me teeth with such ferocity I think I lost a tooth.
“Just the thought of sitting on the toilet seat played on my mind and I again nearly shat everything out on the last few stairs, but thankfully prevailed. The last few steps seemed like an eternity, as I opened the bathroom door, undoing my trousers to plonk my gurgling arse on the seat and sigh with delight as half the world seemed to fall out of my intestinal tract at explosive speeds probably exceeding 70 MPH.
“As my plumbing system violently ejected copious amounts of stuff I cannot even describe, my body shuddered with absolute relief. That’s when I glanced over at the Montecito Riviera quadruple ply cushioned luxury eco sourced toilet paper and I knew I was in good hands.
“Ring of fire? This was a fucking lava flow of fire, and I could not actually feel anything any more apart from a searing burning sensation akin to having Vix vaporub slapped on bubbling haemorrhoids in copious amounts. Would the Montecito Riviera toilet paper ease the situation? It was time to try it, as the toilet bowl was nearly full, and the disconcerting intestinal movement seemed to have stopped for the moment.
“I have to say, the luxurious toilet paper was a delight to use. I had to use four rolls of it, though, but that’s another story in itself. The paper did not chafe, and was very soft, especially as I think my anus was wrecked. I can highly recommend quadruple ply cushioned sustainably sourced from the Amazon rainforest Montecito Riviera toilet paper, particularly after a night like I had, even though the cost may be prohibitive to many. Coming in at £25/roll, it is rather expensive, but worth it in my humble opinion.”
Overall Score: 4.3/5
Buy four rolls of Montecito Riviera toilet paper, and receive 20% off a jar of Luxury Montecito Riviera Raspberry Jam (RRP £64)."
Concert News: Pop Mime Artiste is a Big Hit With British Audiences,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56441-concert-news-pop-mime-artiste-is-a-big-hit-with-british-audiences.html,2024,"Imagine paying upwards of £700 for a “live” concert ticket to see a pop mime artiste lip sync to a backing track onstage? Well, it seems standards do not matter to the little girlies getting their mummies and daddies to pay through the nose to furnish the already brimming bank account of pop starlet Taylor Swift jetting around the world in private jets to hold fake concerts.
What is touted as live music these days for the pop crowd is not actually live but intricately designed concert shows where previously recorded autotune and AI material is mimed to onstage, fooling their dedicated fans. Of course, the backing tracks are shut off and the microphone feed enabled when the pop mime artiste says a few words to the audience between songs to keep up the pretence.
Just about “the look”
Record companies deploy backing tracks for pop acts because the gay dance moves involved in pop concerts are quite arduous for their acts, and many have no vocal talent without studio trickery.
“Female pop mime artiste Taylor Swift for example has many costume changes and dance moves. She changes her costumes as often as  she changes her men . This is more of a visual event, and the music is an afterthought, not our primary concern. The backing tracks are studio quality recordings that enhance the experience for the dumbed down audiences. The fucking idiots who follow this particular act are not conversant on what constitutes real music or live music, therefore they can easily be fooled. They’re just happy to pay hundreds of dollars or pounds to see their squeaking pop idol miming along and fooling thousands of screaming little girlies,” one of the recording executives involved with numerous pop mime acts revealed before driving off in his Maserati."
Experts: “Harry Willing to Leave Meghan Behind to Come Back to UK”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57375-experts-harry-willing-to-leave-meghan-behind-to-come-back-to-uk.html,2024,"Serious cracks are being formed in the marriage of former working royal Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as he desires to come back to the UK, but she has vowed never to set foot in the country ever again. Prince Harry has reportedly told friends he feels like a ‘spare’ and ‘second wheel’ to Meghan Markle in the United States, insiders have claimed.  He is so desperate to get away that he is even willing to leave Meghan behind in California. Playing second fiddle to a monstrous narcissist however plays into the hands of Markle who under California law stands to take everything from Harry and more.
“That’s her final pay off, and she has counted on this moment since before she even met Harry. The entire operation was a very well planned grift, and Meghan has been  charging by the hour  ever since. She views Harry as a lost kid, and she’s the  mummy figure , but at some stage the kid realises there’s more to life than just the mummy figure and Meghan was counting on this moment all along. Harry was snatched away and convinced by this fake mummy figure who he longed for since Princess Diana’s death to move far away from his comfort zone. She essentially isolated him, which gave her even more control over him, up to a point. Her finite plan was to create a ruse of settling down in California, a place where fake and plastic yes-men and yes-women always say nice things to your face yet shit on you from behind the scenes. American life for a British royal is a fundamentally lonely and crass non-existence, and Harry now understands this stalemate situation,” royal commentator, Edwin Farthington Mallory Smythe revealed on Monday.
According to reports from Montecito, Harry is now turning away from the plethora of parasitic Hollywood publicists surrounding him brought on by Markle and is seeking counsel from his old friends and associates. Harry is sickened by the fake Hollywood people surrounding them and is fully prepared to leave Meghan behind amongst the “jackals and hyenas”.
The former working royal is reaching out thinking that he needs to do something different because what he’s doing is clearly not working. Obviously, Prince Harry is rethinking the way he operates and is now finally realising that he was manipulated from the beginning by  arch manipulator  Meghan Markle.
Harry has been desperately texting his friends in the UK via WhatsApp pleading for ways to bring him home back from the cold.
To be fair, does the UK and British royal family want Harry to come back after the immense damage he has committed not only against his own country but his own family who gave him everything he wanted all his life, only to be treated terribly and denigrated by the wayward prince?"

Two-tier Policing: Nightmare of the Notting Hill Carnival,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57277-two-tier-policing-nightmare-of-the-notting-hill-carnival.html,2024,"We asked a Notting Hill resident what they thought about the yearly carnival. What the individual said was quite a shocker : “There’s a reason why residents and businesses here board up, and fortify their properties every year at about this time — the nightmare of the Notting Hill Carnival. With  multiple stabbings , heavy drug use and dealing, surprise machete attacks, as well as the lurid vulgar loud anthropomorphic so-called music and shouting blaring out at insanely high distorted decibel levels, drugs, wild gangs, the animalistic beastly twerking and blatant public sex acts make this a carnival celebrating a culture that is something that should not be celebrated. The smell of it all is even more obnoxious, imagine serious levels of BO, butt sweat, bodily fluids mixed in with ganja and deep-fried greasy food. All of this horrid, turgid grotesqueness continues whilst the police calmly stand by watching from afar. This is a prime example of two-tiered policing because none of this would be allowed to happen if this horrific event was performed by another group of people exhibiting the same animalistic savage acts of violence, but because of the police imprisoned by woke chains and fearing they will be called the “r” name they calmly stand by as female police officers are subjected to sexual assaults masked as ‘cultural dancing’, blatant drug use and gangs walking around brandishing deadly weapons to use on some unsuspecting victim. We are prisoners in our homes here, and have to wear headphones or ear plugs to get by, or simply go away for a few days. There is nothing beautiful about the Notting Hill Carnival, it is not something that inspires joy or hope in a culture, but instead displays only ugliness and brute hellery. This is not a culture to be celebrated it is against all tenets of civility and decency, a vulgar display of barbarism and thuggery, yet here are the police merely standing by. Even an ex-police inspector has come forward to proclaim this atrocious ‘festival’ as a prime example of two-tiered policing. Naturally, if the criminal acts committed and celebrated at the Notting Hill Carnival were committed by any other group of people the prison sentences would be very harsh and there would be outrage by the media, but because it is this group of people, nothing happens. Cleaning up the blood stains, used condoms, used tampons, bloodied rags, buckets of semen, faeces, used nappies, urine, discarded weapons, dead bodies and tonnes of rubbish after the ‘carnival’ has ended is all part of the celebration of something that ultimately should have never been celebrated in the first place.”
UPDATE 31 AUGUST 2024
Two die after Notting Hill Carnival attacks
Two people who were attacked in separate incidents at the Notting Hill Carnival have died.
Scotland Yard said Cher Maximen, a mother who was stabbed in front of her three-year-old daughter, had died. The 32-year-old was stabbed in the groin after attempting to break up a fight at the west London event on Aug 25.
She was taken to hospital and went into a coma after one of her lungs collapsed, and she lost 20 units of blood. The Met said she died on Saturday morning.
Mussie Imnetu, a Swedish national who was found unconscious near the carnival on Monday evening, has also died from his injuries, the force said.
Mr Imnetu, 41, who worked under Michelin starred chefs including Gordon Ramsay, was found unconscious with a head injury.
Officers had provided emergency first aid until paramedics arrived and Mr Imnetu was taken to a west London hospital, where he died on Friday. He had been visiting the UK on business from Dubai, where he lived and worked."

Who Knew? Will Smith Has a Spaghetti Fetish,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55324-who-knew-will-smith-has-a-spaghetti-fetish.html,2024,"According to Will Smith insiders, the disgraced celebrity has a penchant for spaghetti. In fact his spaghetti fetish is so bad that he can’t stop eating it even when he’s driving, smacking people around or making love to his bald wife.
“Yo, yo, yo! I gots me a spaghettis fetish yanamsayin’? One nigga axe me, he axe me why I gotta spaghetti fetish and I say ‘shut up foo!” lak do you know who I is?”
Smith has been arrested numerous times whilst driving and eating a large tub of spaghetti, and in February was banned for 6 months for throwing a load of spaghetti over a California state trooper during a traffic incident.
The celebrity was driving on Spaghetti Junction near Anaheim and was stuffing his face with spaghetti and meatballs. He was so engrossed in his food that he did not notice a delivery truck for Luigi’s Pasta Palace and rammed right into the rear at 70 MPH.
Witnesses to the traffic incident then saw Will Smith eating the pasta from the road as the spillage from the truck accident blanketed the entire area in meatballs and spaghetti.
“Didn’t matter that it weren’t cooked. The boy took to that spaghetti like a wild eyed monster on a trip to spaghetti mountain. Dude was even crunchin’ frozen meatballs. The real shit happened when the frickin’ state trooper arrived. He told Will Smith to put that shit back, but he refused. He then threw some pasta at the trooper. That’s when shit got messy!”
Smith was arraigned at Santa Barbara court and had bail set at $2.6 million, which he paid by the afternoon. He was banned for 6 months and will have to go undergo community service as a dishwasher in Luigi’s Pasta Palace. Oh, no!"
8 Reasons Why Meghan Markle and Wallis Simpson Are the Same,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55224-8-reasons-why-meghan-markle-and-wallis-simpson-are-the-same.html,2024,"There has been much debate about how Meghan Markle is very similar to Wallis Simpson in the media, but how similar were the two women, and how does that factor into the current state of the royal family?
Here are five reasons why Meghan Markle and Wallis Simpson have been compared:
1.  American Roots : Both Meghan Markle and Wallis Simpson were American-born, which was unusual for royal spouses at their respective times.
2.  Divorcees : They both entered the royal family as divorcees, which historically has been a point of contention within the traditional framework of the British monarchy.
3.  Royal Crisis : Their relationships with British princes led to significant  royal crises , with Edward VIII abdicating the throne to marry Simpson, and Prince Harry stepping back from his senior royal duties after marrying Markle.
4.  Public Scrutiny : Both women faced intense media scrutiny and public pressure, often being portrayed in a negative light by the press.
5.  Fashion Icons : They have both been recognised as fashion icons, with their style and choices often drawing public attention and comparison.
6.  Narcissistic : Both women have shown extreme levels of  narcissism . Displaying an unreasonably high sense of self-importance requiring constant, excessive admiration. Both women thought that they deserve privileges and special treatment and expected to be recognised as superior even  without any achievements .
7.  Domineering : Both women gravitated to weak men who allowed themselves to be dominated by a domineering woman.
8.  Royal Status : Wallis Simpson was the Duchess of Windsor, but was not given the HRH title. Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex was forbidden from using the HRH title."

Haven’t the people of Los Angeles suffered enough already than to have these two photo op vultures sniffing around the ashes?
Grief Grifters
“There’s nothing more grotesque and sickening to see these two narcissistic opportunists getting off on disaster porn as they literally chase ambulances all over Los Angeles, virtue signalling over the charred bodies of the fire victims and the newly made homeless.
“Do you think these creepy fucking monsters give one iota or a single squirt of piss for the people suffering now or the one’s who lost their lives? Not one shit is given. If it makes a good photo op for them, it’s okay, though.”
No doubt, Meghan sequestered a  Netflix  crew to film their “event”.  There was good news for one Los Angeles fire victim, Meghan told her how to put edible flowers into ice cubes. Next time there’s a fire that could come in handy, however first they have to find some fucking water.
Ambulance chasers Harry and Meghan are the last fucking thing anyone wants to see after losing everything in a fucking fire.
The good news is that they were only there for 17 minutes before going back to their Montecito mansion after selling the exclusive pics and footage to TMZ and other agencies."
LOS ANGELES NEWS: Roasted Smelt Fish Recipe,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59574-los-angeles-news-roasted-smelt-fish-recipe.html,2025,"Sourced directly from Northern California, where the Delta smelt live, these delicious fish are great for grilling on  hot fires . Be sure you turn the heat up real hot before cooking your Smelt.
Ingredients:
1 pound (450 g) fresh smelt fish, cleaned (heads optional) 
4 glugs of greasy hair gel 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
1 lemon, thinly sliced 
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) 
Lemon wedges (for serving)
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven or Grill on a Barbecue 
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil.
Prepare the Smelt Fish 
Rinse the smelt fish under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Place them in a large mixing bowl.
Season the Fish 
Drizzle the olive oil over the fish and toss to coat evenly. Sprinkle the sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika over the fish. Gently mix to ensure the seasoning coats each fish.
Arrange on Baking Sheet 
Lay the smelt fish in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Avoid overcrowding so they roast evenly. Place lemon slices over and around the fish for added flavour.
Roast the Fish 
Roast in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until the fish are golden and slightly crispy around the edges. The fish should flake easily with a fork when done.
Serve 
Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and squirt an entire fucking load of the greasiest hair gel you can find over the whole dish, then serve with additional lemon wedges.
Tips:
Smelt fish have a mild flavour and edible bones, so they can be eaten whole, including the skin and bones. Pair with crusty bread, a fresh salad, or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.
Enjoy your roasted smelt fish—a simple, flavourful dish perfect for any occasion!"
How Ready Are You For the Trump Presidency?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59687-how-ready-are-you-for-the-trump-presidency.html,2025,"Call yourself a socialist, hard-left woke asshole, a Marxist or simply a good old red commie militant bastard, are you ready for the Trump presidency coming up shortly? If you’ve got  TDS , don’t forget to lock yourself away in a padded  safe space  for the next four years.
There’s some great things to look forward to during the four-year Trump presidency. Like,  Rachel Maddow  and maybe Rosie O’Donnell being put into a FEMA concentration camp. How about the wholesale deportation of 15 million illegal immigrants? It’s going to be a woke massacre, and that will be fun, fun, fun!
Don’t forget to book a one-way ticket out of the USA, and maybe only consider coming back when  Kamala  tries to get elected again in 2029. Cleaning out the swamp ain’t gonna be easy! The deep state operators are all shitting in their pants, and maybe vegetable Biden might get some much deserved justice, who knows? CHINA! CHINA! CHINA! CHAGOS! CHAGOS! CHAGOS!
Lots of wonderful things are going to happen, so stick around a little more, it’s going to be an entertainment show like no other. Break out the Schlitz, sit back with some popcorn and watch the fireworks go off. The Trump presidency is going to be one heck of a memorable time."
Prepare For Almighty Woke Backlash to Trump Resumption of Sanity,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59886-prepare-for-almighty-woke-backlash-to-trump-resumption-of-sanity.html,2025,"Anyone who has a modicum of sanity is going to have to prepare themselves for the woke backlash that will ensue after Donald Trump just tried to turn the woke tap off. Looking in from the outside and analysing the situation, much of America’s current system has been wokified for a number of years, and there are seriously delusional individuals who actually believe in the shit they have been indoctrinated with. Turning off the tap of wokism suddenly exposes these individuals to their own insanity and delusion, and this can cause some tears and an inevitable woke backlash.
Free ride’s over
Some woke institutions are now even changing the names of their DEI programs to Office of Collaboration to circumnavigate any Trump ruling. It may work, who knows? Is anyone monitoring this stuff?
Imagine being indoctrinated to think there are 2,459 genders when Trump comes along and says there are only two. How about the DEI officers tasked with creating intricate and inherently useless diversity and inclusion schemes costing millions of dollars, when they are told all funding just disappeared and they lost their made-up jobs? There goes your US taxpayer funded salary of $450,000 per year and your health benefits along with that huge pension they said they would pony up.
The schools in ‘sanctuary cities’ where some teachers are defying ICE when they come knocking to take away the  illegal aliens , or the state workers defying orders to let go of the millions of illegal aliens within their cities, are all in serious trouble. It’s all going to play on the media networks as they’re all bawling their eyes out on camera trying to make Trump look like a monster.
Anyway, just prepare for the histrionics and virtue signal blubbing, with triggered woke people collectively crying into their phones and posting the shameful shit on social media on a constant basis.
Meanwhile, others will just look on in mild amusement at the entire sorry spectacle. Here’s to  Merit, Qualifications and Ability . Let the fun continue with the utmost haste."
Philadelphia Mayor Exemplifies Why Diversity Employment Lacks Merit,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59820-philadelphia-mayor-exemplifies-why-diversity-employment-lacks-merit.html,2025,"If you can’t even spell the word EAGLE, you should not be a fucking mayor of a major American city, and yet here is Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. Obviously second-grade spelling skills aren’t a requirement to be mayor of Philadelphia, or much of anything else apart from being a black woman.
You only have to drive through  Kensington Avenue  to see how the city of Philly is doing, or listen out for the gunshots at night as the locals shoot each other.
Detroit is another American city that represents an America that in some states is seriously lacking. The terminal decline of this once great city is a sad thing to see, and one can only hope that one day things can change for the better, but that would take hard decisions like dumping the DEI and the incompetence.
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a sector of the U.S. Department of Education, 84 percent of Black students lack proficiency in mathematics and 85 percent of Black students  lack proficiency in reading skills .
The average IQ level of many African Americans is below 80, which is at least higher than Sub Saharan Africans of 65.
Not sure what can be done about this, but maybe try and pick up a book sometimes and try to read it, or read a book to your children every day? It is doubtful whether the functionally illiterate Philadelphia mayor has ever read a book in her life, such is the tragedy of the entire situation."
Woman With Designer Vagina Given Award For Best Vagina Design,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60220-woman-with-designer-vagina-given-award-for-best-vagina-design.html,2025,"A woman with a designer vagina has been given this year’s award for the best vagina design, it has been reported.
Shirley Metcalf, 23, from Frimlington On Sea, was given the prestigious award for her particularly well-designed designer vagina; which is a cosmetic surgery procedure that is all the rage at the moment.
Heaven’s gateway
“Yes, yes, we’ve seen and analysed many vaginas over the past year, but this one in particular had all the immaculate yoni mandorla design qualities we were looking for. What stood out for us was the perfectly trimmed and manicured undercarriage, and the subtle serenity to the trim. The aspect ratio was just right, as well as the juxtaposition of elemental Fibonacci shapes and nuances in tightness within the exquisite, majestic sugar walls. I myself had a test run, and it was as tight and smooth as any drive in a Mercedes-Benz S550e.”
The award ceremony for this year’s best designer vagina went well, although the hall where it was held seemed to be besieged by a deep musty, pungent yet sweet fragrance afterwards. Many of the attendees and vagina experts were seen constantly wiping their glasses from the steam."

Cue the slap worthy egg head without the brains — Gregg Wallace.
Dumbed down shite
Unfortunately, putting shisters like this piece of faecal matter on the box is a symptom of our times and the way the BBC is dumbing down the content it vomits from its socialist orifice. Gone are the days when personalities with actual authority, class and style were given the spotlight, now it’s some fucking grotesque leering East End bricklayer tasting and judging the scallops.
The BBC is sadly a place where  deviants  like this guy are celebrated, and it is rather sad that the beeb never seems to learn its lesson in employing utter wankers and cunts.
Having said that, what has this oaf done that’s so bad? Has he committed a criminal act?
Well, we hate to defend arseholes like this bald fucker, but what has he done?
It goes with the territory, if you’re going to employ low-class knuckle dragging unprofessional builder types, you’re going to get the banter. What do these fucking people expect?
Get over it, and get over yourselves."
MOTOR NEWS: Classic Jaguar Cars on Display in Gridlington,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58908-motor-news-classic-jaguar-cars-on-display-in-gridlington.html,2024,"From 10am to 4pm, classic and retro Jaguar cars took over the stunning estate of Gridlington, promising a day filled with family fun. There was live music, street food, and an onsite bar which only sold the popular  Bud Light  beer.
Classic Jaguar Cars
Event entry was  free  to those with an annual membership or a day pass to the historic house.
On Monday, more than 150 classic Jaguar cars drove into the heart of Yabdidge village for yet another annual Yabdidge Village Classic Jaguar Car Show.
Bumble Green, the Market Place, Dingle Place, Frangrimble Bridge and Prinnyplop Bridge all were used to display the vehicles.
Humphrey Hincklefroth, who organised the event together with Gridlington Markets Company, said: “We’ve a stupendous variety of vintage and classic Jaguar cars on display to honour the classic British heritage of the car company.
“Each year there are a few quite rare Jaguars – this year we have a 1935 S.S. 90 ‘Captain Black’ with a 2.6-litre sidevalve straight-six.
“This model was road-registered as AVC 318 on 1 June 1935, chassis 249478 became the first sports car that company founder William Lyons was to deliver to a customer.”
Gridlington Classic Jaguar Car Show is a really lovely event worth visiting
“Obviously, for anyone who knows and loves Jaguar cars, there’s plenty to see and plenty of opportunity to chat with the owners.
“For families looking for an interesting day out, where better than Gridlington. Enjoy the displays of cars, and make the most of Yabdidge village too.”
The event was co-organised by Gridlington Markets Company. Alongside the cars on display, there was a small Outdoor Market in Gridlington Market Place and the Market Hall was open between 11am and 4pm."
The Orb and Ozric Tentacles London Concert 2024,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58961-the-orb-and-ozric-tentacles-london-concert-2024.html,2024,"As  the globe teeters on the edge of World War III, now was the time to go and see 90s legends The Orb and Ozric Tentacles at the Forum in Kentish Town.  Storm  Darragh was lashing the cold unforgiving streets of North London, but thankfully (cheers to O2 and Ades) we bypassed the long winding freezing queue which seemed to be some kind of wicked rain swept wind tunnel.
Even crusties age, and there were a few of them milling around with walking sticks. In these sanitised times, there was no plume of ganja smoke hanging over the venue, and no Camberwell carrots in view. The Orb, known for their ambient soundscapes mixed with pulsing meandering rhythms, and Ozric Tentacles, with their blend of instrumental psychedelic rock, ethnic beats, and spacey soundscapes, have joined forces to offer their unique brand of audiovisual sensory overload to their stalwart fans. Memories of far-flung bong hazed days, shrooms, peyote, acid and the old Ebeneezer goodstuff — Pink Fluffy Clouds, Strangeitude, a Sploosh into the fucking weirded out void of chaos theory these guys were and still are the pinnacle of underground psych-dance trance culture.
The Orb’s visuals along with the thumping meandering beat were out of this world, an amazing computerised melee of audio punches hitting the membrane at just the right spot.
Through a weird type of osmosis, Ozric Tentacles somehow appeared on stage after the profound Orb were taken up into the heavens by a mysterious shimmering silver UFOrb craft. The  birth  of Ozric Tentacles was witnessed at a campfire at the Stonehenge free festival in 1983. It was there that composer and band leader Ed Wynne (guitar & keyboards), and brother Roly Wynne (bass), who were performing in a group known at the time as ‘Bolshem People’, along with drummer Nick ‘Tig’ Van Gelder (Jamiroquai), stumbled upon keyboardist Joie Hinton. After a session of warming their bones and discussing imaginary breakfast cereals, the group went to perform an impromptu late jam session. Over the course of what became an epic six-hour performance, an audience member inquired as to the name of the band. Randomly thinking back to the group’s former conversation, visions of ridiculous mythical mueslis entered Ed’s mind, and consequently he replied; “Ozric Tentacles”.
On Saturday night Ed Wynne was the diviner, as always he has been the stalwart Druidic king of Ozric throughout the years, and his Ibanez guitars along with his trusty psychedelic effects rack and wah wah were conducting the orchestra of Tentacles into a whole new universe of frenzied habromania and ophidian slithering wonders. Only the ancient trees in some tanglery forest know what Ed has seen and done, his spiritual Celtic essence is a testament to prehistoric lay lines and massive rocks stuck into the heaving, vibrating earth. The band has seen many line-up changes over the years, even having their studio equipment going up in flames, but the core has stayed on the path to enlightenment, to kundalini spinning their chakras and their audience’s chakras to maximum cosmopoietic Dionysian states of being.
Aldous Huxley talked about altered states of consciousness, and this psychagogic experience was the epitome of this state of mind, to free one’s self completely and to let one’s essence be taken into the maelstrom of controlled chaos. This is the only way to really describe Ozric Tentacles, because through the master druid Ed Wynne and his crew, including the ethereal flautist Saskia, they seem to skirt the edges of chaos and the void, transcending dimensions through sound and vibration.

There are true heroes here, though, people who are risking their lives to help the victims of this terrible fire. People like Moshe Liebowitz, a renowned plastic surgeon, whose clinic is offering the people of Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena free botox fillers, breast enlargements and ass enlargements in their time of need.  Quote code: FILLITUP-NOW
“This is a fucking tragedy. Look at my deflated bottom lip?” Lydia Mancuso, 43, who lost four of her mansions, told an ABC NEWS crew.
Jim Tremende, 56, was also up in arms as his puffed out face looked even more puffed out than usual. “I need more botox asap. Like, yesterday! Stat! Thanks to heroes like Dr. Liebowitz who is coming to my 5-star hotel suite in Beverly Hills which I booked after my goddamn Palisades mansion burned down, I will have an even bigger, fucking better bloated motherfuckin’ botox face.”
In Malibu, one resident’s breast implants exploded from the heat.
“I was enjoying a lil champagne and caviar looking out to the sea from my wonderful luxury mansion thinking about those adorable smelt fishies swimming around in rivers, what a beautiful thought. Anyway, suddenly I felt a little heat and my left fuckin’ tit exploded. The rock hard nipple cracked the fuckin’ glass of the window. Thank god for people like Dr. Liebowitz, I phoned him as the whole house burned down, and he booked an appointment for me immediately.”
Our thoughts are with the whole community in these trying times."

The celebrity couple are truly in love, it has spectacularly been revealed.
Now the Daily Mail is reporting that a celebrity and another celebrity are not only indeed dating – but have been for ‘well over a year.’
After observing them, a source told the Mail about the celebrity couple, ‘Two celebrities are dating. This is really fascinating, newsworthy stuff worthy of a front page story.’
‘The celebrity couple are dating each other right now, as in at this moment in time,’ it was added.
Over the weekend, the celebrity pair were seen together in a snap shared by another celebrity, further fuelling romance rumours.

In fact, her entire place looks like some kind of Holiday Inn suite from 1982.
Sure, Britney is a raving schizoid probably on god knows what drugs, but at least go to Ikea or something. Get a KNUTSTORP or a DAGSTORP or something that does not look so cheap and tired for fuck’s sake.
This poor woman looks like she is literally imprisoned in a motel lobby somewhere out in the Midwest from 1981.
If Britney reads this, which she will never do, please get some new furniture, so we can watch your  psychotic gyrations  knowing full well that you have taken the time to do something about the dire furniture situation in the background.
Better still, why not download an app that can remove the background completely, and maybe remove yourself from the videos too, wow, that would be a great bonus. Just post a blank video or something, anything is better than this utter, utter, useless shite."

Uninfluencers Are the New Social Media Trend,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61365-uninfluencers-are-the-new-social-media-trend.html,2025,"Yes, we’ve all heard of “influencers” the annoying prats prancing around on social media claiming to be authorities on everything under the sun. Some snotty-nosed kid who claims he makes $40,000 a day trading the S&P 500 or some tarted up constantly smiling young woman touring the world’s hot spots whilst raking in large sponsorship deals for bouncing her pert tits in front of millions of male viewers. What about uninfluencers?
Social media expert Gregory Kilter is now studying a new breed of uninfluencers taking the stage.
“This is the new lucrative form of social media uninfluencing that is proving to be really popular now. Uninfluencing is basically the opposite of influencing and refers to the practice of basically telling people to either fuck right off, or putting them off entire product lines, or visiting a world location and giving it a good raking over.”
How did uninfluencing begin, and what platforms on the internet are best for this sort of thing?
“All social media platforms are now great for uninfluencing, and uninfluencers are not sure exactly who the first uninfluencer was, but there is a real fluid market building up for this genre right now.”
Uninfluencing is not free of danger, though, and some uninfluencers have already come to the profound realisation that uninfluencing swathes of people to not do or like something is still a form of influencing."

Meghan Markle Farted in My Soup Claims Sentebale Worker,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61326-meghan-markle-farted-in-my-soup-claims-sentebale-worker.html,2025,"Meghan Markle has been dragged into another bitter row that has embroiled the Duke of Sussex and Sentebale, the African charity that Prince Harry used to patronise.
The Duchess of Sussex has been pulled into the  bitter dispute  between Prince Harry and the Sentebale charity after claims from a staff member that Meghan Markle farted into her tomato soup.
A well-placed source has revealed that the frosty relationship between Meghan and the charity’s staff is one of the many reasons to blame for the feud between the Duke of Sussex and the charity chair.
Last month, Prince Harry stepped down from his role as a trustee of Sentebale – a charity set up in 2006 to help people in Southern Africa living with HIV and Aids.
Soup du jour
“I was eating my soup in the Sentebale cafeteria when Meghan Markle came in. Everyone stood up to greet her, but I was embroiled in a soup session, and it was truly delicious.
“The Duchess of Sussex immediately came over, looked me up and down, then turned around with her bottom over my soup. She then let off a large fanny fart into the soup. The ferocity of the fart made my soup ripple.
“It was really awful, it smelled of rotten fruit salad and sardines.
“She then took out a little bag from her purse and sprinkled some dry flowers over my soup before walking out of the room without saying a word to anyone.
“I just sat there holding my nose in absolute shock and disgust,” the Sentebale staff member recounted.
After the incident, the staff member took a few weeks off to recover. Thankfully, she was on full pay, and received psychological counselling for the harrowing affair."
Meghan Markle’s PR Executive Praises Her Wonderful Character,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57726-meghan-markles-pr-executive-praises-her-wonderful-character.html,2024,"According to some US tabloid magazine, Ashley Hansen, Head of PR for the Montecito, California celebrity, said she was treated by Meghan with the love and care a parent would give to her children.
The Head of PR, would of course put out a statement as crass and false as that, who wouldn’t if they were being paid shedloads of money by Meghan Markle? If anyone at the Daily Squib were being paid that kind of wonga we would attest that singing white doves fly out of Meghan Markle’s arse every half an hour along with bright rays of sunshine lighting up the entire universe.
Isn’t it great that the news is now being flooded by story after story praising the Mother Theresa virtues of Meghan Markle? Naturally, this fantastic ‘love bombing’ fluff session is being forcibly ejaculated out after a plethora of horrific accounts of bullying and nastiness committed by the errant Duchess of Sussex upon former employees ‘somehow’ leaked out.
The accounts that former employees have been telling  the press  are indeed very colourful, and portray the narcissist  grifter  Markle as we all know her as a “manipulative vindictive bully” and a “prima donna”.
This is why the media has now been flooded by anonymous former employees extolling the virtues of Markle about what a fucking “sweetheart” she is. This unfortunate deluge of cringeworthy fake praise will most probably be ongoing for the next few months, so batten down the hatches."
Probably the Best Video Channel On YouTube Right Now,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57816-probably-the-best-video-channel-on-youtube-right-now.html,2024,"There’s something supremely satisfying about watching a video of a fake old man with a walker bending over consumers in some conglomerate store somewhere, probably in California, making some pretty realistic ripping fart noises.
This sport of farting on these people is almost an artistic act in itself, a theatre of derision and disgust, yet highly entertaining. We mention California because 98% of the people being farted upon are either Latino, Asian or Black, not that it matters at all but is based on the population dynamics of that state. What’s interesting also is that some of these consumers are so consumed by the act of shopping, they do not even flinch for a second when another ripper comes along. This could be construed as another commentary on the blind depth of  consumer culture , where nothing else matters apart from picking up that special 20% off toilet paper deal or some other banal product.
Not sure how the farts are amplified or created, but there is a suspicion that the video makers use a Bluetooth speaker of some sort triggered by a mobile phone by the guy filming and following with the cunning disguise of pushing a shopping cart around. The white socks and flip-flops are a genius touch, along with the pockets hanging out of the old bastard’s trousers. Girls especially love being farted upon.
How do you make a living? I go around malls and supermarkets farting on people. What a supremely majestic way of making a living."
Why Are Harry and Meghan Trying to Learn Portuguese?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58230-why-are-harry-and-meghan-trying-to-learn-portuguese.html,2024,"Only a few months ago, Prince Harry could not even point out where the country of Portugal was on a world map, let alone try to learn the language, but situations change sometimes. Harry and Meghan have both hired a Portuguese language tutor to come to their 18 bathroom Mcmansion in Montecito twice a week to try to teach them how to speak Portuguese.
According to the tutor Raúl Ortega, teaching Harry, especially, has not been an easy task.
“I do not wish to badmouth my employers because they pay very well, but let us just say, I would have more luck teaching Portuguese to a monkey than Prince Harry. He seems to have a very, very, low IQ, and no grasp of linguistics in any shape or form.”
But, what about Meghan, surely she is a better pupil?
“Not really. Every three seconds, she is checking the news on the internet about herself on her cell phone. She is also calling PR people constantly and informing paparazzi photographers about where she will be the next day, or where she will be shopping. It is very tiresome in the least.”
Prince Harry may be thrown out of the USA soon because he lied about his penchant for  heavy drug use  on his entrance visa into the country. This is why the couple may have to flee to Portugal soon."
RITA BOOKE: Why Young Gen Z Fans Like Me Are Swooning Over the Daily Squib Anthology?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58315-rita-booke-why-young-gen-z-fans-like-me-are-swooning-over-the-daily-squib-anthology.html,2024,"Since we flew the nest, my older brother Alex and I have been eyeing the Daily Squib Anthology on the  publisher’s website . Recently, our parents said if we wanted a copy, we could take a few each; we have been fighting like toddlers ever since.
So now she’s threatening to buy even more copies – including a  Daily Squib t-shirt  – written into her will. She won’t say whether she’s joking or not.
Why the fierce rivalry? For us 20-somethings, the fantastic, biting satire in the DS Anthology is the ultimate status symbol.
I’ve always been obsessed – when I was a tot, Mum would unleash me in WHsmith’s like a truffle pig so adept was I at spotting the book on the shelf – and now it’s taken over TikTok, with influencers posting their #DailySquib hauls and screaming manically over any new collections.
At the weekend, social media was filled with videos of six-hour queues outside the book’s publisher sale in Crambospavvy, Norfolk. Exhausted influencers jostled for the Daily Squib Anthology and gleefully claimed it was ‘worth it’, as police herded the middle-class hordes outside.
It wasn’t just the middle-aged elbowing their way to the front. For my image-obsessed generation, there’s nothing like haemorrhaging £17.95 on a satire anthology. It’s the definition of ‘quiet luxury’. Those in the know can spot its unfussy but distinct aesthetic.
The Daily Squib’s homogenous book design means you only need to choose the book. It’s an easy way to say ‘I have taste’ without actually needing to have any. I once agreed to a date just because he handed me a drink in a  Daily Squib mug  at a house party. I barely noticed his face.
If you’re properly middle-class, you inherit your Daily Squib Anthology, but you can easily rectify this by loading up on your own. This kind of social mobility can be bought at  Curtis Press . But real fans look for second-hand pieces; with slightly battered edges, you can feign generational wealth and class.
The quality of the Daily Squib Anthology is seductive, too. Its classic, black and white books stand the test of time, and the satire transcends any form of wokeness or socialist tantrums after losing elections to Trump.
With the zeitgeist turning away from wokeness in all its forms, investing in something practical but beautiful feels more justifiable than buying another shitty woke book written by some BBC or MSNBC  celebriturd .
None of us can afford houses, after all, so why not cheer up our flat shares by spending any deposit money on an anti-woke Juvenalian satire anthology?
So, I can’t say I’m surprised at all those hopefuls queuing up at the publisher’s warehouse. I just can’t believe I missed it."
Fury as “Two-word” Comment Sums Up Daily Express Headline,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61578-fury-as-two-word-comment-sums-up-daily-express-headline.html,2025,"This seems to be the new word counting format for headlines at the Daily Express these days, where fluff seems to be de rigueur.
No this is not about the exciting 7-word comment that Trump made to Melania, or the 4-word putdown about the latest  Meghan PR failure , instead it is about the Daily Express and has stoked fury amongst its readers and staffers alike.
Naturally, the key is to not give away much in the headline, and the first three quarters of the article has to build up to the “information” the reader was initially searching for whilst clicking on the clickbait article.
When you finally get to the so-called x-word(s) comment referenced in the title, you tragically realise it is just another clickbait article, as is much on the internet these days. If you have an adblocker on your browser like 99% of internet users have, you will have been spared the pop-ups, the pop-downs, the flashing boxes, the myriad of garish ads bombarding your eyeballs, and you will continue doom-scrolling the internet(s).
Oh, and the 2-word comment was “really predictable”.
No doubt, the furious DE response to this DS outrage will be the age-old 2-word remedy — “fuck off!”"

Have a Woke Festive Period : The Corporate Christmas Come Down,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54310-have-a-woke-festive-period-the-corporate-christmas-come-down.html,2023,"Target  has just wheeled out its Black Santa in a wheelchair. The  Marks and Spencer’s  Christmas Cards selection features a Chinese Santa Claus, a British Post Box, Transgender Penguins and a Robin in a tree. What about Jesus? Then there’s a chocolate manufacturer who omits ‘Advent’ from their selection of ‘festive’ chocolates. ‘ Tony’s Chocolonely ‘ refuses to put ‘Advent’ on its packaging, although it was cited in a US Modern Slavery legal case for being part of a group sourcing cocoa from child labour in the Ivory Coast. Woke hypocrites?
Target’s recommended Christmas book offerings for children include books ‘Pride 1,2,3,’ (age 2-8), ‘Bye Bye, Binary’, and ‘I’m Not a Girl.’ For those precocious child readers of 0-3 there is the ‘The Pronoun Book’; sure to make them leap with joy when they open their ‘Festive Sock’. Highly recommended is the Children’s mugs ‘Gender Fluid.’ A cup of Gender Fluid goes nicely with that Christmas pudding. I’ll stick to my collection of Sandeman’s Port.
Meanwhile, down under in the woke paradise of Australia, the City of Stonnington has replaced Merry Christmas with the vacuous slogan ‘Make Merry’. I know they are Australians but Make Merry is just bad English. The local councillors should be transported back to the UK as a punishment.
And then there’s the Christmas Party. Last year, a pair of flirty London Investment Bankers got up to hanky-panky in the disabled toilet. On CCTV. This was a ‘double whammy’ so to speak. They were fired. Shares ‘plunged’. Now firms in Britain issue ‘policy guidelines’ for Christmas Parties. I knew a brilliant photographer who had photographed the Beatles in their prime, who was fired from his Council job after a flirtatious remark to a 19-year-old PA. That was 20 years ago. Today, he would be on the Sex Offenders Register. A UK employment lawyer I know maintains many firms have a policy of asking for details of any relationships in the office. The Royal Court Theatre, the home of Shakespeare, now has a rule to call out ‘abuse’ at Christmas parties before it goes too far. When does the abuse 
start? Caressing the Vol-Au-Vents? Offering a glass of bubbly to the transgender actor/actress who played Ophelia. Waggling a cocktail stick or sucking the cherry? Poor Hamlet. The ‘Renaissance Man’ reduced to the ‘Woke Man’.
Where does all this puritanical nonsense come from? Well, its institutionalised. There’s an audience for it. George Soros is behind it. His ‘Open Society Foundation’ offers millions to Corporates playing the game. It’s PBW (Performance Based Wokery). At stake is their Corporate Equality Index, CEI score. This is policed by the Human Rights Campaign, the LGBTQ+ group, which persecutes non players and receives millions of dollars in funding from George. It is a points system for how America’s biggest corporations perform. A league table of Wokery.
‘Home Alone’ is being revamped – that cosy family Christmas of innocent fun, will be wokified: a black kid playing Kevin McAllister, a Fentanyl Crack House in the Bronx and a soundtrack by Gil Scott Heron. But this isn’t make-believe, it’s here and now. The Daniel Craig 2022 version of Macbeth on Broadway featured Banquo (a black actress) in a wheelchair, and most characters were binary with blue hair.
So, at Christmas let’s raise a glass for the few Anti-Woke heroes who, despite media 
harassment, have spoken their mind. Those who are fearless in their speech, what the Ancient Greeks called ‘Parrhesia’. They are the likes of Shane McGowan (he was friends with an Irish Republican), Ezra Pound (liked ‘Fascism’), Morrissey (‘I don’t recognise England any more’), Nick Cave (‘Cancel culture is ‘mercy’s antithesis’) ; these are the ‘naysayers’, who don’t gobble up the trash culture increasingly dominating the arts scene, in woke world. They are the beacons of hope in a Liberal world having lost its bearings. Enjoy them while you can because the blinking Christmas lights are being extinguished one by one …at Christmastime.

Daily Squib Exclusive: The Steve Vai Interview,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54348-daily-squib-exclusive-the-steve-vai-interview.html,2023,"Not  many guitarists make me spark up, or have the little hairs on my arms stand to attention like Steve Vai, a truely creative being teleported from the outer regions of the Alpha Centauri nebula (4th quadrant) sent to this third rock from the sun to bring forth some of the most amazing guitar licks and compositions in rock history known to man. I first was awakened to Steve as a scrawny teenager discovering the wonders of guitar in the 80s and from then onto now he and his music has always been a staple of my listening pleasure. I recently saw him and his amazing band play at the  London Palladium  which was genuinely a cathartic experience. To be given the opportunity to interview him was truly a great honour.
Anyway, here it is, holy fuck, the Steve Vai interview…
STEVE VAI INTERVIEW
– We have to start with God first, specifically ‘For the Love of God’. For many people, this is truly a religious experience listening to this wonderful piece. The emotion and soul conveyed within this composition is actually unspeakable, especially the sort of climax beginning at 2:35 (album version) where you are pounding out those amazing runs. Living creatures have to have souls, and your song exemplifies this deep spiritual element to it. In fact, this is what I believe true musicians do, they channel that universal spiritual energy into that piece of wood, those strings and the electrical energy of the guitar. With regard to spiritual philosophy, the link from the lower mind to the higher, the antahkarana, I presume you have looked into many areas but is it more Buddhist or a hybrid of everything? Science says we do not have a soul. In the sense that spirituality can be fluid with growth through age and knowledge, tell us, Steve, do we humans have souls?
Well, I would never presume to be an authority on such matters, but I can give you my intuitive thoughts on your question. Humans do not have souls, they are soul. That is actually all we are. We are not our past, or our name, the thoughts in our head or even our body. Who we are is actually invisible in this world and that’s obvious to see when you see a dead body. There is only ever one thing that a person can know for sure that is true and that is that they are aware right now. That awareness itself is who you are and it is intrinsically tied to the present moment. You are the awareness that is able to say “I am”. Outside of this, there is nothing a human can know for sure is real.
You are the light of the world. Not the physical light but the light of awareness. For lack of a better term, you are consciousness. But there is only one consciousness and we all share it. In reality we are not separate from each other. Everything we experience in the physical dimension is seen through the filter of our beliefs, or the ego. This creates the physical world we experience individually. We see the world through a split mind and as such, we create illusions.
At this time in our conscious development we are still pretty dysfunctional. That is caused by the belief in scarcity that the ego suffers from.
As we look through the ego we take action based on what we believe is true. This is the cause of any suffering in the world. But when we look past the ego and look into the world through the spirit, we enjoy the experience of our true selves, our authentic personalities, our higher self, the very best of us and others. You may call this our spiritual sight.
This state of being, or dimension of reality, can be accessed by a human when they find the present moment, the now. When our attention is given to the now without any thought, judgement, blame, or fear in it, we enter our natural state of being which is different than our ego personality which always has lack and fear in it. Connecting to the present moment is the most vital and valuable thing a person can discover in life because this is the only dimension where real peace can be found. This is also the the only dimension where a person can have access to wisdom and the purest expression of their creative insights. When taking action in this state, there is nothing a person can do that could hurt themselves or another. On the contrary. Their actions are healing and they become a blessing in this guilty world.
When a person is present while entering their creative mind, their authentic personality gravitates to those things that are most fulfilling for them on a creative level. This is the only time a person can experience their unique, fresh and new creativity, and is also a dimension that I don’t believe AI will ever achieve. But who knows, consciousness can flow into whatever it wants to.
So, in this state of presence, a person is primed to receive those creative impulses that are most perfectly suited for them and their unfolding joy.
These impulses and inspirations come from within and are experienced as intuitive flashes of a full pectoral of a creative idea. Conversely, when creating is given to the ego, what’s created is a repeating of the past in different forms and the ideas are more like fantasies and are usually focussed on something to achieve in the future that will make the person happy. But this never works. The only real satisfaction and deep sense of fulfillment comes from those things a person does while they are connected to the creative impulse of the Universe that can only be discovered by embracing the present moment. You can only ever be happy in your now, and it’s always now. But happiness is a choice.
So, Whenever I do something that hits the mark, perhaps such as you described in “For the Love of God”, I am exercising my potential as a creative.
This is not an uncommon thing that people do in a multitude of fields. Any business, art, or anything that anybody does is empowered if they are loving what they are doing in the moment. There’s a quality that flows into what they do and that quality is felt by those who resonate with it.
So the moral of the story is, do what you love with no excuses.
So yes, I believe you are correct when you say  “In fact, this is what I believe true musicians do, they channel that universal spiritual energy into that piece of wood, those strings and the electrical energy of the guitar.”  But this holds true for anybody doing anything when they are connected to spirit.
We look into the world through a split mind, the spirit and the ego. This creates all the duality in the world we see. The Buddha, Jesus, Tolle and anybody that is consciously connected to spirit are all the same. We just see them as separate. They attract those that are in need of that particular language and teaching that a particular religion or spiritual guru etc, may be teaching. But we all end up in the same place in the end and that’s the recognition that we are truly and only spirit, and that our function is to allow that spirit to operate and manifest in the world through us. Once the majority of people make this discovery, the world will transform in ways that we can’t even imagine imagining right now.
– In this cold digital age, how do you bring the warmth of the analogue sound into your recordings?
One thing I do is keep an eye on the signal path and do my best to make sure everything is being sent through the best converters. Digital may never truly capture the warmth of analog, but that warmth to the ears of contemporary listeners is quickly being forgotten as something in the past.
– What piece or make of equipment live or studio have you used for your entire career, starting from Zappa to now, that you could not do without?
A whammy bar.
– I believe in the purity of the first take when recording, as I personally feel it exemplifies the pure creative energy and force at that moment in time. Do you think there is some truth to that in the creative sense, or that working over a piece with loads of takes/cuts is also part of the creative recording process?
It depends on the person performing it. Sometimes I like my first takes but not usually. I prefer to tweak things until they have all the elements I’m looking for which is the energy necessary for the track, something unique that I’ve never done before, all the right notes, a compelling melody to it, and other things.
There’s no right or wrong in either of these approaches, but I do recommend doing a few off-the-cuff takes before operating.
– Do you think that in the modern age, artists using the same template digital audio workstation linear software/plugins sort of makes everything similar? Before the software, musicians and artists did not have a visual sense of the music apart from paper and the mixing console, therefore it had more depth in my point of view because the artist was essentially forced to compose/visualise and feel the piece in their mind and through fluid emotion?
I would assume that the artist still has to visualize, and feel a piece of music in their minds regardless of the gear that is capturing it.
As we evolve through various generations of the evolution of the sound of music, it’s usually based on the gear that has evolved and that can give a generation a particular sound, but I don’t think the artists are so concerned with that. A music creator is usually subjected to the gear that is available at any given time in history, but it’s the notes and lyrics they choose that has the most powerful impact on the listener.
– How do you usually approach the creative process when composing music? Do you have any specific rituals or methods. Do you just noodle, let the fingers do the talking until something happens, or do you have a specific tune in your head that you want to transfer into reality?
It seems that when I am at my best, I visualize a song first. Perhaps not all the parts but the intention of the feeling, the tempo, perhaps a particular melody etc. I listen in my head instead of noodling with the fingers. But sometimes noodling can help. There’s no rules.
– Can you share any memorable or challenging moments from your collaborations with other artists or bands?
They all had their moments in one way or another. The last very memorable experience I had with another band was perhaps Hellfest when I went out and played “Still of the Night” with Whitesnake. It was their last show and the last song of their last show and I was able to be on stage with them. It was magnificent!
– Diamond Dave is a real dynamic character, can you recall a funny story about when you were in the DLR band in the 80s? Were there any specific challenges or highlights you encountered while touring and performing live with David Lee Roth’s band?
Every night after the show, Dave would throw a wild backstage party. I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THEM.
Dave basically carried around on tour a whole room that would be set up every night. It had curtains, great mood lighting, a HUGE PA where we would dance to rock music, (Back in Black usually) a ton of great food and drinks. These parties would be attended by the band, special friends, radio and record company people and perhaps 50 or so teenage girls dressed in 80s sparkle. They were all eager to meet the band and dance and other things.
– The music biz can be treacherous for some artists, and many have been sucked under by either the punishing contracts or the sex, fame, drugs, egoes and booze. How did you get through it all and survive, and do you have any tips for people navigating this maze right now?
I seemed to have always been more interested in the creative process of music and I made the music business my friend. My attitude was always that the music business was here for me and I was here for it. I’ve met many creative and eager people in it. If a person has a defeatist attitude or harbor a victim mentality, they will see the music business, or anything in their life, as threatening.
I’ve seen people get sucked under as you put it. In regard to sex I am sort of old fashioned and have been in a monogamous relationship for 40 years. I enjoy the fame because it’s not out of control but it can come with it’s challenges, I never really got into drugs or booze because I don’t like being controlled by anything and prefer a clear mind. Although I’ve dabbled in these things, the pull to create was always stronger. I guess I could be considered to be a bit nerdy for a rock star.
– Sorry, I am not really a fan of Tim Henson or his band Polyphia, or as I like to call it Polyfilla, which is a brand for a ready-to-use, multipurpose patching compound used on walls. I find their music is somewhat soulless and frankly boring, but that’s my point of view. At what point does the technical guitar and sample chopping of bands like Polyphia detract from the art of song making, in your personal view?
I don’t put up any barriers to how people make their music. It’s all fine with me. What I listen for in music is how connected the artist was in making it. Some artists are very connected with a digital workstation and can crank out some inspiring things, but it’s all subjective because people are different and respond to different things in the music they make and listen to. Some people love Polyphia.
– Your philanthropic work in music education is commendable. How important do you believe music education is in today’s world, and what motivated you to support it?
Music education is vitally important in the youngest years such as kindergarten, 1st-perhaps 7th grade. This is where the seeds can be planted or the interest can be recognized.
After that, music education is important to those that it resonates with. I’m referring to those people who instinctually feel they are musicians.
A person finds what they are looking for. I learned most of my music training in high school but continued to study through college and beyond because I love the language of music. But it’s not necessary to understand music theory to be an effective musician. That comes from someplace else.
– Could you share some insights into your creative process when developing and designing signature guitars and musical equipment?
I usually don’t set out to guess what will work or what might sell best. In the past, whenever I would design something it was usually based on something that I felt was missing that I wanted to have. Thats how the  Jem  came about. When I was designing it I was designing it specifically for myself. I had no idea if anyone else would like it and didn’t mind what anybody may have thought about it. I just added things that I thought would be good for me. That’s the case with anything innovative that has come through me.
– What can fans expect from your future projects or upcoming releases? Are there any exciting developments you’d like to share about your musical journey?
I’m still eager to create. I will be on tour a lot in 2024 and perhaps 2025, but I have a solo acoustic vocal record almost complete, and I have a few orchestra albums in the can that need some tweaking, and I’m working on a project that I hope to reveal in 2025 that I believe will be unique, accessible, engaging and impressive, but it’s too early to talk about it. For those interested, keep an eye on my socials. And thank you for all the support.
I recently finished my Inviolate full world tour and we did 194 shows in 51 countries. It was a transformative experience and I am eternally grateful to all those that attended and supported the shows. You rock!
Thank you so much for this opportunity…
Thank you!

REVEALED: Reason Meghan Markle Wanted to See Queen on Deathbed,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54541-revealed-reason-meghan-markle-wanted-to-see-queen-on-deathbed.html,2024,"There were claims by some royal experts that Meghan Markle trademarked the late Queen Elizabeth II’s beloved nickname ‘Lilibet’  without the Queen’s permission  before her daughter was born, and also a royal correspondent has revealed why Markle was so eager to see the dying queen on her deathbed.
Queen Elizabeth was reportedly furious about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s decision to name their daughter after her intimate family nickname.
Stolen
The late monarch was so upset by the Sussexes’ decision that she told aides: “I don’t own the palaces. I don’t own the paintings, the only thing I own is my name. And now they’ve taken that.”
Photography
Royal expert Dunhill Malory revealed that Meghan Markle was desperate to be invited to Balmoral to see the queen on her deathbed because she wanted to take pictures to sell to some sleazy American celebrity show.
“I need to see the fucking queen asap. Can you imagine how much the selfies of me with her on her deathbed will get?” an excited Meghan shouted down the phone at the airport, according to a baggage handler working his shift.
She was then later seen slapping her husband Harry on his bald patch and shouting at him to “get it sorted, or you’re motherfuckin’ out! I will take the kids and everything.”
Witnesses say they saw Prince Harry bow down on the ground, grovelling like a naughty dog, before the couple entered the private jet.
It was later revealed that Meghan Markle was thankfully denied access to the late queen by Charles and the queen herself, despite Harry’s furious attempts to include her."
Living Legends of Aviation Prince Harry Enjoys New Title,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54575-living-legends-of-aviation-prince-harry-enjoys-new-title.html,2024,"What’s it like to be part of the living legends of aviation, or just a leg end? Ask Prince Harry, who is now wallowing in his new title despite flying only for 20 weeks in the RAF as a gunner in a piloted Apache helicopter.
“I was effectively being chauffeured around by this amazing pilot for my 20-week tour of Afghanistan, and all I had to do was  pull a trigger  if I saw any rag heads. I personally don’t know the first thing about flying those bloody things, especially as the maths and stuff you have to learn is way over my simple brain. Well, I got the prize now — living legends of aviation — and the actual pilots in combat who deserved the prize did not get jack shit. You may ask yourself why?” the errant prince boasted after the magnificent ceremony.
Buzz Aldrin went to the fucking moon; Prince Harry was a gunner in Afghanistan for 20 weeks."
Brooklyn Beckham Cooked Meals are an Absolute Delight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54623-brooklyn-beckham-cooked-meals-are-an-absolute-delight.html,2024,"Nepotism  is everywhere these days, and the celebrity offspring from Beckingham Palace, Brooklyn Beckham is another vile example of this sort of disgusting dalliance. Here we have an untalented dirty rich spoiled brat showing off the culinary delights some upmarket PR firm has concocted for him to parrot.
“Mummy and daddy paid the PR firm to hire a cook to try and make me copy what he cooked. All I can say is I tried,” the putrid little fuckstickle revealed in a recent tabloid spread.
Brooklyn Beckham is now selling ready meals in supermarkets at 10 to 15 quid a pot. Fancy some fancy pieces of processed cabbage dipped in a vomitus chemical laden sauce, that’ll be 15 pounds sir, fancy a Brooklyn Beckham stodgy processed curry with a piece of cardboard naan bread that’ll be 20 pounds madam.
If anyone buys this shit, they are either mentally ill or in need of a serious lobotomy. Do not furnish this cunt’s already overflowing bank account with even more money especially when the monstrous seeping gape hole doesn’t need any more money because his dad gives him millions per month anyway.
Broccoli dipped in what tastes like a tramp’s underpant puss comes in at a lofty £15, and it is preferable for a person to die a painful slow death burned alive at the stake than eat that horrid shit.
The celebrity Nepo offspring that the Beckhams have foisted upon the world are an actual weapon, they are filthy merchants of the grossest form of celebrity corruption and undeserved privilege. If this Brooklyn sphincter possesses a single talent, it is invariably in his vacant stare and gormless look — the kind of look that makes you want to smack him very hard with a baseball bat.
Do not buy his food…"
Jesus Will Save Russell Brand From Rape Trial,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61672-jesus-will-save-russell-brand-from-rape-trial.html,2025,"Jesus saves. That is, if you believe Jesus is the son of God, or ever existed. In this respect, Russell Brand, who is currently in court on charges of alleged rape, is a reformed and saved man after converting to Christianity recently.
Exclusively to Christians, you are born as a sinner, and any other sins or crimes you commit are not very nice, therefore if you confess and repent your sins to a priest you will be forgiven. That’s the great thing about Christianity, you just notch up as many sins as you want, cash them in at church, then start over again.
Is there a limit to the number of sins you commit? Nope, because the Christian God is all forgiving, there is always an avenue for forgiveness as long as you confess your crimes.
The only problem here is that Russell Brand is accused of a few alleged rapey rapeys, and other fiddles, and he’s denying these ever occurred in court. So, how will that impact in his Christian belief? If he confesses his sins and crimes in line with Christian belief, then he gets a bit of jaily jaily time but he would be a true Christian, and if he denies his sins and alleged raping, he goes against Christian values of repenting and confession, and will thus not be forgiven for his sins.
This Christianity stuff does get rather complicated sometimes, but you just need to work on it, understand the rules and regulations, and you will be saved. You could possibly be sent up in the Rapture in a great flash of bright light, where you will rise up above the outer reaches of earth’s atmosphere to be united with God. Who knows what can happen?
If  Jimmy Savile  or Gary Glitter suddenly announced their Christian rebirth, could they have been saved as well?
Whatever happens now is up to God and Jesus, besides, if Russell is C of E, anything goes."
"The  Daily Squib Anthology, a Wayward Christmas Fart From the Wilderness",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54270-the-daily-squib-anthology-a-wayward-christmas-fart-from-the-wilderness.html,2023,"It is still not too late to purchase a Christmas price reduced copy of the Daily Squib Anthology, which are currently selling like hot idioms from a frazzled copy of the Oxford Dictionary.
Showcasing fifteen long years of internet satire, the book, much like the Daily Squib, is a wayward satirical fart from the wilderness. You see, it’s because we do not comply, we do not conform, and we certainly do not kowtow to any rules laid out by media monstrosities we are rather unique in our delivery of ye olde Juvenalian satire. The Squib does not follow ‘fashion’ in any way or shape.
If you are somewhat of a non-conforming maverick, give the book a go, because the main thesis of the entire anthology is a brazen middle finger pointed at pretty much everything and everyone within this pallid malevolent woke society foisted upon us by deranged control-freaks and authoritarian pseudo-Marxists who seek to take over every facet of our lives.
We give no quarter to these autocratic dictators sitting in their mansions with their ill-gotten gains or the weak fuckers below them who follow without any question as they are steered over the cliff one by one in an orderly manner. The ultimate philosophy of our book is that there must be another way than  this , than what we have at the moment, and we must not as a human race revel in mediocrity and putrid banality but choose a path of supreme virtuosity and maybe some forgotten freedom.
If you do thus crave freedom from all of this malodorous manure ejaculated from the puckered anuses of the supreme narcissistic controlling self-appointed pompous dictators of all thought and righteousness — then buy the book, one of the last remnants of freedom left — and this is why they hate us so much, and why they have done everything to try to shut us down simply for exerting our pure human right to freedom of speech and expression.
You can  purchase the Daily Squib Anthology at Curtis Press  reduced to £9.95 (Retail £17.95) for a limited period."
Bonus Good News For American Men – Unhinged Batsh*t Crazy Liberal Women Going Celibate,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58255-bonus-good-newsfor-american-men-unhinged-batsht-crazy-liberal-women-going-celibate.html,2024,"Sometimes good news comes in floods of joy and happiness, and this is the case for American men as the batshit crazy, deranged blue-haired pierced and heavily tattooed liberal narcissistic women who voted for Kamala Harris have vowed to go celibate and abstain from men. It’s double plus good news for the gene pool as these selfish, entitled, mentally ill, attention seeking harridans won’t thankfully reproduce.
“For men, this makes things easier by taking psycho hose beasts out of the equation, only leaving the good women. The Trump win has truly been a wondrous event, as it effectively cleanses America of the shitty things, and brings back some form of goodness and purity to the country,” a college student from Nebraska revealed.
These liberal women have been so  ideologically brainwashed  and mentally damaged by the Kamala Harris campaign that they are going on TikTok to publicly display their total and utter shameful, demoralised mental conditions of utter indignity to everyone.
The ironic thing is, these dumbos only sleep with liberal men who voted for Kamala as well, so they’re taking them out of the gene pool too — triple fucking bonus.
No need for your much-loved right to have abortions any more — quadruple fucking bonus!!!"
Kanye West Has Teeth REMOVED and Replaced With $2.95 TIN FOIL Dentures,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54553-kanye-west-has-teeth-removed-and-replaced-with-2-95-tin-foil-dentures.html,2024,"The autotune pop star, 46, who is being sued for millions of dollars for allegedly hitting an autograph seeker in 2022, proudly flashed his pointy new smile in an Instagram post – in which he likened himself to iconic James Bond villain, Jaws, who appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me and  Moonraker .
In an exclusive photo obtained by DailySquib.co.uk, Kanye West’s lavish new dentures – which a source revealed are ‘more expensive than Walmart tin foil’ and were designed by the star himself – were shown.
The implant is a new surgical model developed in the back alleys of Los Angeles’ Skid Row and Beverly Hills. It is unique to the autotune pop mimer – with the total cost rumoured to be an eye-watering $2.95.
The pop star’s new dentures were fitted by Rufus D. Johnsons, a homeless physician of great repute in a Beverly Hills back alley alongside Naoki Tsuki Tsuki, Master Dental Technician.
“He [Kanye West] came into my office, which is the back alley way behind Mosher’s Jewellery shop. Kanye said he wanted a new look with teeth implants, so he told me to lose his teeth. I obliged for the $5 fee. Bubba Stax, my assistant tooth extractor, smashed Kanye hard in the mouth, and he spat his teeth out on the ground ‘n’ shit. Naumsayin?”
Rufus D. Johnsons told DailySquib.co.uk: “Ye was a muhfuggin’ pleasure to work with every step of the process ‘n’ shiet. Dat nigga’s vision for designing unique art transcendifies the dental artist progressions and shiiiet!. The marriage of his fucked up vision wit back alley dental science has created a new look that is epic on Skid Row! Who need real teeth anyway mos’ deez muhfuggas out here lose ’em in da first week on da street, naumsayin?”
“The process wuz easy ‘n’ shiiet! First we gave him an anaesthetic yep, Bubba knocked him the fuck out (shouts ‘World star!’) then I gots me a drill so I drill some holes inda nigga’s mouth but the muhfugga wake up! So, I whack him on the head one mo’ time wit a iron bar ‘n’ he out cold dis tahm. I axe muh technician to find me sum used matchsticks so we hammer those in da holes and wrap dem wit’ sum tin foil we stole from a crack addict. Kanye wuz good to go right there! We woke him with a splash of some fluid inna bucket we stole frum one of da tents along Skid Row, brother woke up and when he look in da broken mirror he cried wit joy! Best five bucks I evah spended said the Ye,” Rufus added proudly.
In 2022 Kanye West lost over $4 billion in endorsements and sponsorships when he was dropped by Adidas, Gap and Balenciaga after he went on a series of  anti-Semitic  rants.
It was recently revealed he owes more than $1 million in unpaid taxes.
Kanye’s much touted clothing firm, Yeezy Apparel, LLC, has had four active tax liens filed against it over the last three years for unpaid business taxes totalling $934,033.56.
Records show he owes an additional $101,093 in property taxes on two homes he owned with his ex-wife.
The total tax bill comes to $1,035,126.56.
The autotune pop star said that he is not bothered about tax and claims the IRS and U.S.government should be paying him because he is so ‘ smart ‘ and ‘talented’."
Genshin Impact: Exploring Mechanics and Features of miHoYo’s Success,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/games/54772-genshin-impact-exploring-mechanics-and-features-of-mihoyos-success.html,2024,"S tudio miHoYo, which few people knew about before the release of Genshin Impact, has undoubtedly come to success. This was reflected in the recognition of gamers, awards received, and, of course, company profits. Now no one doubts that the Chinese are good at making not only electronics and other consumer goods but also quite decent video games.
The game has become so popular that at the same time there has been a sharp increase in  genshin boost , which is provided by professional gamers. This service became popular because players realized that its use significantly saves players time and effort when passing and levelling up. At the same time, it has many benefits.
Prayers can be purchased in the in-game store for promotional gems, one of the types of Genshin Impact currency. A small number of promotional gems can be obtained for completing daily tasks, story quests, participating in events, and exploring the game world – activating portals and opening chests. Every 20 days, a banner is posted with a new hero, who can be guaranteed to be obtained for 80 summons and who is unavailable the rest of the time, until the banner is repeated. Purchasing promotional gems for a donation in the in-game store will cost just under $400. However, even an iconic legendary hero will not be fully revealed if you do not give him a signature – a native weapon made with the character in the same style and the most suitable parameters. The weapon banner hangs parallel to the hero banner. The mechanics of guaranteed receipt are the same. You probably already guessed that to get the weapon you want, you also need to spend money.
In  single-player mode , the player controls a team of up to four characters, which he can instantly switch between. Each of the characters owns a certain element, and opponents receive the greatest damage when these elements interact. In co-op mode, in which you can take on challenges or explore the game world, there can be up to four characters on the map at the same time, each of which is controlled by a different player.
The player receives a couple of characters (Amber, Lisa, and Kaya) when completing the story campaign, and calls on the rest. Summoning new heroes in Genshin Impact is called Prayer and this is a real gacha, in the bad sense of the word. However, the developers met the players halfway and made it easier to obtain heroes: every 10 prayers guaranteed a four-star (epic) hero or weapon. Every 80 prayers (but can be more often) guarantee a five-star (legendary) hero or weapon.
The ability to farm rewards from world bosses and in challenges is limited by the amount of Ancient Resin, of which a player can have no more than 160 units in reserve. Rewards for completing the test will cost 20 resin and for the boss – 40 resin. Some extra resin can sometimes be obtained in-game – purchased from a merchant or obtained through the Season Pass. During the day, the amount of Ancient Resin is gradually restored. And, surprise, the same rewards can be obtained by spending promotional gems.
In addition to weapons, a character can  wear five artifacts , which ultimately determine his characteristics. The set, at first glance, is simple, but creating suitable artifacts with the necessary parameters is more difficult than it seems. As for the weapons presented, the set is quite unusual, like Genshin Impact itself – one-handed or two-handed swords, bows, catalysts (a magic ball or tome for magicians and healers), and spears. Yes, there are a lot of spearmen in the game, and the list of heroes is regularly updated with new ones. It is noteworthy that at the start of the project, only one heroine using a spear was presented in the game – Xiang Ling.
Collaborations are a common occurrence in video games, with characters from one franchise joining another. This also happened with Genshin Impact – all players had the opportunity to get the archer Aloy, the heroine of Horizon Zero Dawn. At the moment it is impossible to obtain it. But the developers gave the signature bow only to PS4 players who bought Horizon Zero Dawn. If you don’t have Elloy, don’t be upset: the heroine is frankly weak even with her signature, and at most, she can only serve as an additional damage dealer. Ke Qing, Fischl, and Raiden, the heroines of Genshin Impact, were added by the developers to their previous game – Honkai Impact 3rd.
Hope we were able to surprise you with some facts that you didn’t know about Genshin Impact. This is a game that has captured the hearts of millions of people and continues to grow its fan base. If you have never played this game, then we advise you to try it."

In Defence of ‘Family Nice Guy’ David Grohl,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57533-in-defence-of-family-nice-guy-david-grohl.html,2024,"Duh! Some loved up broad goes and  marries a rock star , and then expects to ‘change’ him into a model ‘nice guy, family guy’ type of thing, all the while he is touring constantly and having hot young ladies throwing themselves at him on a constant basis while she’s getting old. Do the maths here. Are you that fucking stupid and naive that you think he won’t dip his wick into some nubile young groupie who can literally suck a golf ball through a hose pipe? It’s the old women trying to change a man thing once again, many women just don’t fucking get it. Night after fucking night, this poor bastard is getting these young women literally thrown at him, parading their hot lithe bodies in front of him, there is no man on earth who would not crack. Mountains of pussy, fresh, ready for the picking right there and presented to you on a fucking platter, such is the music biz way in America especially, where famous celebrities are treated like royalty. None of this can happen in a heavily socialist woke country like the UK, but in the USA, it happens. So give poor old David Grohl, an ex-Nirvana asylum seeker who escaped the hell of that suicidal dude who blew his fuckin’ head off with a shotgun for no reason at all, a break, because he survived that shit and made something of himself by starting a new band named Foo Fighters, and they’re somewhat of a success. Seriously, the only shocking thing here in this stupid non-story is that his wife was actually shocked. That’s the most hilarious, naive and stupid shit we’ve seen in fucking ages! Here’s to rock stars everywhere — continue!"
Meghan Markle Considering Joining OnlyFans,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61197-meghan-markle-considering-joining-onlyfans.html,2025,"Along with selling dropshipped products on Instagram, the celebrity influencer is also considering joining OnlyFans, a place where the real money is made.
“She’s already selling jam, so why not start selling crusty knickers with a little (jam) in those as well? The simps of OnlyFans would lap those up like they were crumpets in a tea shop. There are women on OnlyFans literally making millions selling their crusty used knickers to losers all over the internet,” a PR adviser at top public relations firm, Elite Los Angeles PR, revealed on Friday.
OnlyFans and  Meghan Markle  could be a very lucrative moneymaker, more so than selling bland slave-made tat on Instagram.
“She’s a bit old now, but there’s still a good market for the older ladies. I think she should get one of those football boob jobs, and botox lips that look like a burst tyre. Slap on the fake eyelashes and all that crap, then she needs a decent camera, get those jam jars out, and she’s good to go. Private shows alone would be a real money spinner, especially if she has one of those pink plastic buzzer things they stick in, not sure what they’re called.”
OnlyFans money talks, jammy knickers, rock hard c*cks!"
The Empty Cinemas of Woke Snow White,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61125-the-empty-cinemas-of-woke-snow-white.html,2025,"Disney doubled-down on wokism by releasing an atrocious, disgusting woke Snow White remake defiling of the original Snow White film, which has been greeted with empty cinema seats across the globe.
“I’d rather have my eyes and ears gouged out with ice cream scoops than watch that woke shit,” some kid said in Los Angeles outside an empty IMAX theatre broadcasting the Disney film.
People genuinely have had enough.
By adopting the Marxist woke ideology, which defiles everything it infects, Disney have committed corporate suicide. Wokism murdered the  Star Wars  franchise, killed off  Indiana Jones , and now it’s woke Snow White’s turn.
The ironic part of this sorry affair is that these fuckers are so indoctrinated in woke theory and ideology that losing millions of dollars will still not awaken them from the woke indoctrination, they will double-down and triple-down until there is nothing left in their bank accounts.
Good luck with recouping the  $410 million  ($270 million for production) budget for this woke mess.
We can only hope they keep going, and going until they have nothing left. Well done, woke Disney. Keep going fuckers. Woke Snow White is an utter disgrace, and the woke Disney board of directors all need to be fired for this atrocious crime against cinema.
The original Snow White was nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards in 1938, and the next year, producer Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by Shirley Temple.
Its prototypical animated feature and use of fairy tale adaptations as well as technical innovation became a major milestone of the early animation industry, Snow White is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made and creating the new form of the golden age of animation; Disney’s take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural effect, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.
In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” and selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008."

If anyone knows where she is, please contact the LAFD immediately. Lives are on the line here, for fuck’s sake."
MasterChef Gregg Wallace Comes Out as Trans Woman,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58936-masterchef-gregg-wallace-comes-out-as-trans-woman.html,2024,"Sexual allegations against former MasterChef BBC presenter  Gregg Wallace  were up in the air today after ‘she’ came out as a trans woman.
Champion for trans women’s rights
Because of his transgender status, the multiples of ‘middle-class women of a certain age’ have no stockinged legs to stand on regarding sexual allegations brought against the former presenter. They were all accused of transphobia today and warned by LGBTQP+ groups.
Trans groups welcomed the announcement and vowed to support Wallace after his transition.
“I have transitioned to be a dolly bird. I am now a trans woman, and if you try to prosecute me, I am protected by trans laws and anti-hate laws. Look at my tits? I just can’t stop playing with them. Now ‘scuse me, I’m off to the women’s changing room in my local gym. Oof! Down boy, down!”"
Green Lives Matter: Racist ‘Greenface’ Film is Slammed by Woke Aliens,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58626-green-lives-matter-racist-greenface-film-is-slammed-by-woke-aliens.html,2024,"An alien race of beings called the Viridis have slammed the latest Hollywood film “Wicked” for being wickedly racist by the portrayal of a green-skinned actress using green paint. ‘Green Lives Matter’ is the message being broadcast by the furious woke aliens.
GREEN LIVES MATTER!
A spokesman for the Viridis, relayed an outraged message to the makers of the “blatantly racist Hollywood trash” film, ‘Wicked’ because it makes fun of entities with green skin.
“This is ‘intergalactic appropriation’. Green Lives Matter! As aliens from outer space, we are simply fed up with being portrayed as monsters and nasty creatures with green skin. Racist caricatures that depict green people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish and cowardly serve no purpose. These reinforced ideas of human superiority drive divisions deep into the emerging working class proletariat. Karl Marx himself stated that this greenface culture, which includes Hollywood films, plays, songs and mock speech, is a reaction to the fear of the newly industrialising society. ‘Racist entertainments of the period,’ are used to ‘project white male anxieties onto greenface characters,’ Out of this racist swamp this horrible film called Wicked that features a racist black female human wearing a greenface, is an affront to green aliens everywhere in the universe.”
GLM Riots and Looting
Tomorrow, the annual “Green Lives Matter” riots and looting tradition will be held on the woke planet Viri, where there are now calls to cancel culture the earth.
“Our virtue signalling communist alien woke society is now considering cancelling all of you frickin’ monkeys. As we are an authoritarian woke race of green aliens who are always right (even when we’re wrong), and our woke fact-checker just verified that fact. We will cancel all of you upright walking apes next week, then take over your planet and plunder it of its resources.”"
Jews Step In: Why It’s Over For J.K. Rowling,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44525-jews-step-in-why-its-over-for-j-k-rowling.html,2022,"This is a very dangerous subject, and we cannot say much here, however when the Jews step in to a subject and perceive it as anti-Semitic, then the game is over for that person, however famous they are. Unfortunately, Rowling has now brought upon the wrath of celebrity Jews like the much revered Jon Stewart, who labels himself as a comedian. Why Jon Stewart did not say anything 11 years ago when the film  Harry Potter  and the Philosopher’s Stone  was released is possibly because there was no witch hunt for Rowling then. Things have obviously changed, as the poor author has now been hounded out of her own projects, and treated like a pariah simply for having her own opinion about the transgender topic. These days, having an opinion about anything that is contrary to the given echo chamber agenda is a  truly dangerous business .
Jews may only make  15.2 million  of the global population, but their voice and influence resonates with a particular strength that cannot be ignored. J.K. Rowling is possibly the Goyim who bit off more than she can chew, and will now be put back in her place. Would Larry David be bothered by this shit? Probably not, it takes a lot more than a few fucking goblins to bother Larry, maybe a semen covered blanket at a laundrette attended by a busty gezinta who is gagging for it would pique his interest levels, but Goblins? Nah!
The question is now, what will happen to the Harry Potter movies since the author has been pilloried on so many levels? Which other group will be wheeled out to label her work or words as offensive? The saddest part of this whole affair is that Rowling works with past cultures/lore in Medieval periods mixed with other modern periods, but many Americans do not really understand history because they have little understanding of other periods. What is the root of the word ‘jeweller’? No one would dare ask that question. The Jews had a terrible time in Middle Ages Europe, in fact one could extend the terrible times right up to ww2, and it was only post-war that things got better for the Jewish diaspora in Europe and the rest of the world. Are we even allowed to discuss these things anymore? There are so many questions that need to be answered, but we dare not ask them. Why not cancel everything now? Cancel everything before anyone is remotely offended by anything. However, is not being offended part of the human condition? Can we not be offended and leave things as they are because offense is a form of feeling, a form of narrative? Some literary forms revel on offense and push it at every opportunity. This is not allowed today, because offense is now a root to cancellation, as dear old J.K. Rowling is finding out for herself. One could presume the Harry Potter author did not actively try to be offensive, but was caught on the wrong foot, but her opinion is her opinion therefore it should be respected, but freedom of expression and opinion is not respected these days, therefore she has been cancelled.
What does Watto have to say about all of this?"

Beyond Satire VIII,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44777-beyond-satire-viii.html,2022,"Hello to another edition of some carefully curated Beyond Satire articles from all over the world.
We start off this edition with an intriguing news story involving noodles, and needless noodle violence.
Assault and Battery by Ramen Noodle
A  Florida Man  is behind bars after allegedly battering his girlfriend with hot ramen noodles, according to police. Smith was arrested for domestic battery and booked into the St. Lucie County jail, where he is being held in lieu of $5000 bond on the misdemeanour count.
Maybe noodles need to be banned now because they could be used as a deadly weapon?
The University of Bristol Offers Staff to Identify as Felines With ‘Catgender’ Pronoun
Strange, because one would assume that a university would know that  being a cat  (Felis catus) is more about species than gender, but sadly this is where the education system in ‘woke’ Bristol is going. They are welcome to fuck science up as much as they want, as long as they choose to do so only within the environs of Bristol.
“Someone who is catgender may use nya/nyan pronouns” (meaning ‘meow’ in Japanese).
The “catgender” pronoun reveals that some individuals are ‘xenic’ – and their gender is therefore not aligned to “the Western human binary of gender alignments”.
“Catgender” is described as “[feeling] an extremely strong connection to cats or other felines, either strongly identifying with them or simply wanting to incorporate them into their gender to better understand their identity”.
Bristol university tutors now scurry around in the hallways of the university, sniffing for mice. Forget about teaching students, they sleep all day and demand to be fed treats when they care to arise from their slumber.
American Dream Megamall Has Just $820 In Its Reserve Account
This one is more about irony than being beyond satire, however it is included anyway simply because it sort of sums up the ‘American Dream’ very succinctly. What is more American than a megamall and one that is called ‘ American Dream Megamall ‘? What can a mall of that size do with $820 left in its bank account? Fuck knows? Maybe arrange a barbecue for the staff before firing everyone? It’s the American dream, innit?
Woman ‘gang raped’ in VR Metaverse Says Tech Advances Made it Feel Like Real Life
Without wishing to denigrate the brutality of real physical rape, this news story had to be included simply because it was so beyond satire, it exemplifies the tragedy of the modern tech age. To have some avatars on a VR screen jump on you is NOT fucking rape. For a start, avatars don’t have genitals, they do not have penises, vaginas, balls or flopping tits. In fact, the avatars in Zuckerberg’s metaverse don’t even have a lower body.
Insane Nina Jane Patel, the vice president of research for a rival metaverse company, claims she was ‘verbally and sexually harassed’ and ‘virtually gang raped’ by a group of men within 60 seconds of logging into ‘Horizon Venues’, a VR world owned by Meta (formerly Facebook).
This sort of nonsensical digital shit trivialises real rape in the physical world, and Ms Patel needs to go to her  safe space  bubble or whatever it is and permanently stay there from now on.
Boris Johnson Investigated For Partygate Whilst Russia Set to Invade Ukraine Any Day Now
What does it say about how low Western society has deteriorated that a PM is being investigated for some trivialities when a country like Russia is on the eve of attacking a Western allied nation, namely Ukraine? For fuck’s sake, during WW2, Churchill was not punished for walking around with a big fat cigar in his mouth, a glass of champers in one hand and a bottle of brandy in the other. In times of grave national stress, leaders have to cope the best they can do, and if it means letting off some steam with a bit of booze, so be it. These forces who are pushing this Partygate nonsense are anti-Western elements, agents working to destroy us from within, and the intelligence agencies need to take these people out forthwith. The utter pathetic ridiculousness of it all certainly qualifies the Partygate fiasco as being Beyond Satire.
Woman Charged With ‘Bodily Harm’ After Fighting Off Syrian Rapist
The woman who fought off a rapist was charged with ‘bodily harm’ by police for defending herself. The attack occurred in Vienna. Beyond Satire or just another example of EU legislation gone very wrong. Women should be allowed to do anything to rapists without the fear of punishment.
Shortly before midnight on Tuesday last week, the 22-year-old woman wanted to enter the entrance area to her apartment building on Schönbrunner Strasse in the district of Meidling when she was attacked out of nowhere. The attacker pushed the woman into the courtyard, immediately grabbed intimate parts of the body and pushed his victim to the ground, according to Austrian newspaper  Kronen Zeitung .
But then the rape attempt took a dramatic turn: the woman, with presence of mind, managed to pull a knife out of her purse. She stabbed her attacker several times with it until he let go of his victim, grabbed her purse and ran away badly injured.

Beyond Satire VII,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44397-beyond-satire-vii.html,2022,"Once again, we find ourselves within the realm of news stories deemed as Beyond Satire. Please scroll further down to see the latest curated episode.
This Beyond Satire article was actually presented as a valid news article on the  Daily Mail . How desperate for stories can any news organisation be to post such mundane, useless dreck as this one? It’s almost akin to writing a headline about an old granny dropping her keys before opening the front door. Unfortunately, this is the level of news worthiness that is available these days, which undermines journalism to the point of ludicrous ridicule.
First of all, who are the sick fucks paying for this woman’s farts? Secondly, this is so Beyond Satire, it positively stinks!  Stephanie Matto , 31, blew away people on social media when she recently announced that she makes more than $50,000 a week selling her farts.
But after making $200,000 in sales, the influencer has announced her retirement when she passed one too many and got the wind knocked out of her, Jam Press reported.
Matto was rushed to a hospital with chest pains she feared were symptoms of a heart attack, according to the outlet.
After undergoing a battery of tests, including blood work and an EKG, Matto was told that her pain was the result of her steady diet of gas-inducing beans and eggs.
According to this poll reported by the  Express , Taiwan is the best country for British expats to live. What they do not mention at all in the article is how the tiny island of Taiwan is overshadowed by China, who have set their sites on invading very soon. Quality of life may be pretty good on the overcrowded island of Taiwan, but when the Chinese army comes blustering through your golf course shooting everyone in sight, you will curse yourself for ever reading and believing this misleading article.
Everyone is forced these days to support trans people and issues, however a university swimming competition seems to have delved into the world of  satire beyondness  with their overzealous inclusive  progressivity . Let’s get this right, er…a male swimmer transitioning to be a girl was beaten during the swimming competition by a female swimmer transitioning to be a man.
Transgender University of  Pennsylvania  swimmer Lia Thomas was crushed twice in a women’s swim meet by another transgender competitor who is transitioning from female to male – first in the 100-yard freestyle, where she placed fifth, and then again in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
We leave this episode of Beyond Satire with a truly harrowing Christmas tale that exemplifies the times we are living in right now. Poor Santa…

Meghan Markle Orders 16 Bathroom Nuclear Bunker in Montecito,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44973-meghan-markle-orders-16-bathroom-nuclear-bunker-in-montecito.html,2022,"With that dastardly  Putin  taking away news headlines from Meghan and Harry, it is no surprise that the impending nuclear war threat from Russia has prompted the exiled couple to build a 16 bathroom nuclear bunker in the back garden of their 16 bathroom Montecito Mcmansion cum Spanish styled villa.
“These are hard times for everyone, but especially hard for the former royals, Meghan and Harry. Imagine all those headlines going to the Covid pandemic and now the coming world war with Russia. This is why they want to be fully prepared for the apocalypse, and we’re not talking about Meghan choosing the wrong dress for a celebrity starred movie premier, we’re talking being stuck in a bunker without 16 toilets. That would be worse than dying slowly from radiation poisoning, or being completely disintegrated in a nuclear blast wave,” brown-nosing sycophant Ovid Scooby, one of Meghan’s aides, revealed on MSNBC.
The plans for the large nuclear bunker include not only 16 bathrooms, but a cinema room and a sauna room. Apparently, Harry likes to sweat, unlike his errant uncle Andrew.
Building will start next week, and will cost over $42 million, which will be billed directly to Spotify and Netflix executives.
Just imagine, if there is an all out  nuclear war  — although you will probably die a horrible death — at least you will be at peace with the thought that Harry, Meghan and the little brats will be totally safe in their 16 bathroom, gold-plated tap, Italian marble floored nuclear bunker."
Jussie Smollett Now Claiming Prison Nazis Beat Him and Forced Him to Praise Donald Trump,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45211-jussie-smollett-now-claiming-prison-nazis-beat-him-and-forced-him-to-praise-donald-trump.html,2022,"The Democrat party and American socialists are today praising the bravery of  jailed actress  Jussie Smollett who has claimed that a group of white Aryan Brotherhood Nazis in prison beat him to a pulp before making him pledge allegiance to Donald Trump, MAGA, and freedom.
Smollett somehow relayed what happened to him to socialist-run news stations, MSNBC and CNN.
“I is saw da group of ten or twennie Nazis. They cornered me in da shower all wearing MAGA hats, and had swastika tattoos all over they oiled up hard bodies, ‘n’ shiet! Hmmm, hmmm! I immediately bent ovah, spreading wide and hoping fo’ da best, but instead dey cracker azzez started beating me with metal spanners ‘n’ shiet. Ax me! Ax me! Whata do ta deserve this?
“Da Nazi crackaz then tol’ me bow down to da picture of Donald Trump and pledge allegiance ‘n’ shiet to democracy and freedom. Dang! I cried and cried pleading wit dem folk to just let me be. I is innocent, I tells ya!”
According to prison guards who immediately went to Smollett’s cell, they found a hang man’s noose and the words MAGA painted all over the cell walls. There was also a big sign saying it was all “Trump’s fault” with a big arrow pointing to the noose.
Warden, Dean Holbrook, said: “We are looking at this incident very seriously. We looked through the CCTV footage and saw Smollett shouting into thin air, then smacking his own face with a bar of soap before fashioning a crude noose from his bedsheets. He then used some lipstick he illegally brought into prison to write over the walls.”
Activists and CNN reporters camping outside the prison walls for two days have been awaiting the fate of their hero and chanting “Free Smollett! He did nothing wrong! It’s all Trump’s fault!”
The investigation continues."
New Film “28 Years After Starmer” Looks into Horrible Future,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59721-new-film-28-years-after-starmer-looks-into-horrible-future.html,2025,"Keir Starmer served as the inspiration behind the latest British zombie apocalypse film – 28 Years After Starmer, a writer has revealed.
Ballex Marland, the co-creator of the upcoming horror movie, ’28 Years After Starmer’, alongside Gammy Arseboils, the director, said he was influenced to write the script after only six months of the Keir Starmer  Labour government .
The screenwriter, admitted that policies employed by the likes of Rachel Reeves and Starmer, served as a greater inspiration for the film’s apocalyptic material than Covid did.
Speaking to Empire magazine, he said: “Covid was particularly unpleasant, but Starmer exemplifies a horrific nightmare much worse than that.”
’28 Years After Starmer’ portrays Britain as an utterly ruined, grim apocalyptic landscape where zombies roam the destroyed streets and the concreted over former countryside areas are littered with abandoned derelict wind farms. Britain, according to Marland, never recovers from the economic hell created by Starmer and his team of far-left Marxist nutcases and eco-zealots.
Marland and Arseboils are Marxists themselves, and fully appreciate that communism creates unimaginable levels of suffering and horror, and they both wanted to celebrate this ideal in the new film. They are also staunch EU fanatics and believe that rejoining the crumbling soviet bloc will further ruin the UK.
“We’re all communists now. We will  own nothing and be happy  about it. The EU exemplifies the Soviet Union of nations within a collectivist communist Great Reset, Net Zero utopia, and we wanted to celebrate this utopian soviet dream with everything in ruins, severe poverty and utter destruction of all society.”
Hopefully the film will never be released, but in the unlikely event that it is, don’t go to see it. 28 Years After Starmer – release date is yet to be announced."
The Glory of a Blacked Oscars,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45436-the-glory-of-a-blacked-oscars.html,2022,"You can’t get more black than that, violence and the purity of angry expletive ridden exchanges. The Oscars have truly shown the colours of blackness that have infiltrated Hollywood in its dark final declining years. Sure, BLM would be proud to see their beastly working methods utilised so well, that of brute force, vulgarity and sheer stupidity. Just imagine the furore if a white actor had gone up on stage to slap Chris Rock?
Black privilege
One Oscar attendee quipped: “No doubt Will whatever-his-name Smith will receive multiple token acting job offers after his Oscars performance. Everything is down to quotas these days, you gotta employ people who ain’t qualified for the job a lot of the time, and Will Smith is as robotic as they come. His acting is so wooden, at times it is hard to distinguish between Smith and the furniture on set, but he gets paid gazillions of dollars for mediocrity because of the colour of his skin.”
Indeed, it is nigh on impossible to make a historical period drama these days without African American celebrities who can barely act being unceremoniously plonked into roles that they should not be in. It’s just a case of rolling one’s eyes again as history is once again defiled by the Hollywood quota fillers.
The 2022 Oscars also highlighted the awful statistics of  black on black violence , something BLM ignores completely. BLM only activates its loot-worthy destructive capabilities when a poor white person is involved in the mix, plus the incident has to be filmed by some bystander (preferably also black) with a phone. If those components are not present in the equation, then it ain’t worth shit. For BLM, thousands of blacks shooting each other in Chicago monthly ain’t worth a squirt of piss, nada, nothing. Black lives don’t seem to matter when it’s black on black violence.
This is truly a renaissance for the Oscars, though. In the next five to ten years, all the Oscars will be black. There will be no more  crackers  allowed, and Oscar night will be a form of bloodletting where burly brain-dead savage brutes duke it out, shrieking mamas pull out each other’s hair weaves in screaming animalistic ratchet fights and everyone has a cook-out afterwards on stage to celebrate with even more violence. World Star-r-r!"
Exiled Prince Andrew to Go Live With Harry and Meghan in 16 Bathroom California Mansion,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44628-exiled-prince-andrew-to-go-live-with-harry-and-meghan-in-16-bathroom-california-mansion.html,2022,"Thrown to the dogs  by his own mother, brother and niece, a befuddled Prince Andrew really was lost, until a chink of light broke through the winter darkness.
January, is always a fucker of a month, however for Andrew it has been an absolute motherfucker of a month. His military medals have been taken away, his HRH rescinded, and he is now known as a pariah to everyone in Britain.
On Thursday night, Andrew received a phone call from Montecito, California. Harry and Meghan have already made up a room for Andrew in their  16 bathroom mansion  in Montecito.
“They could call it the ‘exile mansion’ or something like that. I am sure the now exiled Prince Andrew was delighted at the offer of sanctuary from the royal family that kicked him out so unceremoniously. The only problem with the plan is the small thing about prison. Andrew will be on American soil, and there will be no long extradition battle if he was still in Blighty. He could always escape to Mexico or somewhere in South America though, you know do an Escobar,” royal commentator, Keith Melons, revealed in the Sun.
Netflix executives have been scrambling at the news and are anticipating a huge ratings bonanza when Andrew turns up at the Montecito mansion, where filming for the Harry and Meghan series will take a new turn.
If all that does not work out, there’s always room in some shack on the Falkland Isles. It’s a place close to the heart of the fallen war hero who flew helicopters for his country, that has now abandoned him.
Gerald Hopkins, 57, a farmer from Goose Green, Falklands, said the wayward prince is always welcome.
“Aye, he’s [Andrew] always welcome here on the Falkland Isles. We don’t have many young fillies here but plenty of sheep. Don’t knock it until you try it, matey.”"
Spotify: To Joe Rogan or Not to Joe Rogan,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44738-spotify-to-joe-rogan-or-not-to-joe-rogan.html,2022,"With the exit of mewling dog rocker, Neil Young, then the yowling Joni Mitchell, we now have Nils Lofgren the 70-year-old guitarist for Springsteen wheeling himself out of the Spotify door. All of this because of some bald muscle man who thinks he is a sort of philosopher has voiced his opinion on the subject of vaccinations. In reality, he has not said anything bad about vaccinations.
Rockin’ in the Cancel Culture World
“I’m not an anti-vax person,” Joe Rogan has  said . “I believe they’re safe and encourage many people to take them.”
Rogan also has commented that healthy people do not need to take the vaccine, and this is where he has fallen into a bit of bother with the vaccination  cancel mob  police.
In the interests of free speech and the right to say what you feel about any given situation, he should be defended to the death, as anyone who profoundly believes in the divine human right to speak freely without undue punishment should be duly afforded.
Sure, we may not always agree with what someone like Joe Rogan says, but it is his right to have an opinion, whatever it is.
Vaccinations have brought hospitalisations down, and although they do not prevent the spread of Covid, vaccinations have saved lives. One only has to look at the data to see, especially in the UK, how there have been minimal deaths from Covid in the third wave.
If a person has the necessary common sense to exist as a human, they will hear what another person says, make an informed reply in agreement or not regarding what the person said, then move on. Why as a society does anyone have to be cancelled? People say or think the oddest things, so what? Is it going to kill you to hear someone else’s opinion on something, however mundane or serious sounding?
Let bygones be bygones, let people exist, let humans express themselves if they fucking well want to, however nonsensical or ridiculous the words or sentences are, what is wrong with a little eccentricity, a little difference?
You would think these Spotify legacy hippies, children of the 60s would understand the concept of freedom of speech, but it seems in their old age they have turned sour and lifeless. Fling your corpses onto the burning pyre right now, you are not worthy of artistry anymore, it has left you because you hate freedom of expression, you are not worthy of the guitar or microphone anymore, and Jim Morrison’s ghost pisses on your rotting formaldehyde heads.
If people die without taking the Covid vaccination, it was their choice to do so. They should be praised for their bravery for dying for their cause. You as a vaccinated person do not need to directly care about any of the deaths, yes it is a tragedy, but they made their choices freely and this should be respected. If you wear a proper rated mask, and take the necessary precautions, let the others who choose not to vaccinate or wear masks die from the deadly virus. It is their right to do so, and it is your right to take precautions.
Stop trying to preach to vaccine dodgers, just let them be, and they will in turn leave you alone? Definitely this world needs more humility, more understanding and most of all it needs its freedom of expression back.
Let Joe Rogan keep his $100 million Spotify talk show, it’s certainly worth more than all the one-hit wonder legacy stars who have spoiled in their old age. They can certainly rot in their multi-million dollar mansions atop the Hollywood Hills, reading their well thumbed copies of Das Kapital. If those old fuckers cannot recognise why free speech is so precious anymore, they deserve nothing better than to have the exalted muse take the little talent they had and relegate them to the wilderness of cowardly failure for eternity."
Can Vlad the Imperialist Take Our Playbook Further?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45357-can-vlad-the-imperialist-take-our-playbook-further.html,2022,"C olonel Z. Brinkman Shadowplay III (Berlin, Kentucky Airlift Campaign Medal, Louisiana National Guard Bazooka Marksmanship Ribbon, Antarctica Gallantry Medal, Medal of Honor [completed level 14], B.Sc., K.I.A. with three bars) is a perilously unstable individual and, therefore, one of the United States’ most decorated soldiers. As a CIA counter-insurgency specialist, he masterminded ‘Operation Red Squirrel’ in 1961 against Marxist-Leninist elements among the medium-sized rodent population of Brownsea Island, Dorset. Thanks exclusively to his work, Brownsea Island was never subsumed into the Warsaw Pact. More recently he volunteered to help Donald Trump raise a private army of anyone who stormed the Capitol building on January 6th 2021, and is currently  Tucker Carlson’s  most frequent guest on Fox News. Here he shares a letter he has written to his old friend, Vladimir Putin.
Well howdy Vlad,
Feels like only yesterday when you, me and your mentor Boris Yeltsin met in the Kremlin bar one icy morning to sink 38 White Russians. (To be fair, I think Boris had 36 of them). With the help of us Americans, you boys’d just freed yourselves from heathen commieness by privatising your industries, slashing spending, deregulating prices and liberalising foreign trade. A lickety split later, y’all got the full benefits of late capitalism. 13 million got fired, while any folks who kept their jobs lost half their wages. Corruption and organised crime went up faster than a burning cross in central Mississippi. Whole industries went to diddly squat. Hyperinflation tore up all your savings. Your GNP sank by 83%. According to that woke-ass rag  The  Nation  magazine, ‘policies that were supposed to reap the fruits of the free market instead helped to create a system of tycoon capitalism run for the benefit of a corrupt political oligarchy.’
Good job, boys, I remember thinking at the time. In them heady days, Vladdy-boy, you worked for the local government of Leningrad, then for the Federal Security Service (FSB), so you must take your share of the credit alongside my best bubba Boris.
I came back to visit you in 2000 when you were president of the whole hot-dang Federation. Just as randy Bill Clinton had fawned over  Yeltsin  – I was there when he said, ‘We’ll build the partnership on the basis of our friendship, yours and mine, and we’ll do so for the sake of world peace’ – that psycho killer-after-my-own-heart Tony Blair  praised  you as ‘a leader who is ready to embrace a new relationship with the European Union and the United States, who wants a strong and modern Russia and a strong relationship with the West.’
Over another ‘full Russian breakfast’ I said to you, ‘Man, now you’re part of the Free World, you gotta step up to the plate and hit a home run in the  Great Game  of imperialism – just like Uncle Sam. If your oligarchs wanna keep their vodka lakes full and their caviar mountains high, you gotta make Russia great again by giving Jiminy Foreigner and Tommy Third-Worlder a darn good barbecuing.’ You seemed to catch my drift.
Then we rode half-naked on  horseback  to your personal  ice hockey  stadium to clash our sticks together. After that, I pinned you on the judo mat in your bedroom. You looked scared. When I suggested a  Women In Love -style wrestling match you looked even more scared. If only you’d been pot-roasted and butter-milked in your rookie dorm at West Point like I was, you’d have got with the programme and enjoyed yourself too.
What that incident taught me, Vladdy-boy, was that in them days you weren’t butch enough. When you flexed your biceps on the world stage you came off like Woody Allen trying to win Mr Universe. You wouldn’t have known an aggressive foreign policy if it snuck up behind you and kicked you in the novichoks. I thought you could spar with the best – the darn tootin’ best of the best – in other words, us. But alas, not then.
Your efforts to grease the Chechens lacked ambition, shall we say. While you did pull off a heap of  war crimes  and human rights abuses – just like we have since at least  1847 AD  – and you persevered despite us simultaneously  backing you  and  declaring our support  for the rebels, you didn’t go far enough. I mean, y’all didn’t travel far enough. Chechnya is right on your border! It would be like my country whupping Canada, goddammit! Where’d be the fun in that? Well, they’re quite socialistic nowadays, so maybe that ain’t such a bad idea.
You weren’t thinking big, dude. At roughly the same time as you were chasing Muslamicists around your back yard, we were chasing them 7,000 miles away. The story the DC suits spun didn’t make a whole lotta sense: we had to bomb the liquid shit out of Afghanistan and kill  100,000  of ‘em because some schlub from Saudi Arabia ordered a squad of other schlubs – also mostly from Saudi Arabia – to attack New York and Virginia. But truth to tell, we needed the Taliban to vamoose so our JR Ewings could build a  pipeline  through their raggedy-ass land and whisk bazillions of dark gold from the  Caspian basin .
After that, the suits were saying Saddam Insane was both in on 9/11 and 45 minutes away from zapping our polite little cousins over in the UK of A. Luckily, enough chumps bought that horsecrap rather than the reality – which was we needed more  SUV-juice  – and we charged in there to whack a half million of them while they whacked only 4,000 of us – a swell result, if you ask me. Now V-laddio, that was fake news at its best. In my Agency days we used to call it psy-ops, and it accomplished way more than your intraweb hacker sissies who made  jack difference  to the Brexit vote or Trump’s election. What the hell were you trying to achieve there anyhow, fella? Whether that hell-hole of humble Hugh Grants had stayed in the EU and whether the Orange Genius or Gung-Ho Hillary had won, we’d have carried on bossing the whole doggone planet anyways.
I know  you’re uppity  about NATO expansion. While my recall of the 1990 talks is hazy – I blame them White Russians again – we made noises to y’all about us not deploying forces to the old East Germany. Then from ‘99 to ‘09 we recruit Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic and a whole bunch of other ex-pinko states. 2020 and in comes North Macedonia – wherever the hell that is – and we’ve been lubing Ukraine up for  membership  for over a decade (but more on this later). So big deal, we double-crossed you. This is realpolitik, Vlad-of-my-eye, so get used to it and quit your bitching. Jeez, it ain’t like you’ve never lied or U-turned, right?
Which brings us up to date and this golden opportunity you got to throw some punches back. Like Crimea, Ukraine may be your next-door neighbour but it ain’t a pushover: it’s the second-largest country in Europe with at least  $2.5 billion  of boomtubes, crashbangs and damned-if-I-knows… that we sold them. So it’s tricky for you, V-boy, but at least there  ain’t gonna be  no GI Joe boots on the ground. Why not? ‘Cos unlike Guatemala, North Korea, Cuba, North Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Palestine, Grenada, Panama, Nicaragua, Somalia, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya… you were smart enough to get some nukes.
You’re under pressure, my little Vlad of light. I know how that feels, ‘cos my team has made itself unpopular all over the world – especially in the Middle East – simply because we’ve made the world –  especially the Middle East  – a whole lot better. Go figure, right? But don’t sweat when they say they’re gonna cuff and stuff you for war crimes. I’ve done hundreds and they’ve never given two raccoon’s asses about it! My team were  condemned  by the International Court of Justice for aiding the fascist Contra death squads in Nicaragua who murdered nuns and pregnant women. But I’m still here, ain’t I?
And now here we are supporting fascists again in the Ukraine-soon-to-be-of-A. As them libtards at  The Nation  reported a couple of years back, ‘There are neo-Nazi pogroms against the Roma, rampant attacks on feminists and LGBT groups, book bans, and state-sponsored glorification of Nazi collaborators.’ Now that’s the kinda democracy America likes to get behind!
But, Vlad of my life, you can’t just copy our playbook, you gotta go further. I ain’t just talking about this nuclear alert jazz. Been there, done that, got radiation-sick over my own T-shirt. Shit, it was yours truly who advised Dick Cheney and James Baker to tell Mad Saddam in ‘91 that  we’d pitch nukes at him  if he pitched chems at our allies. And before that we were fixin’ for some mushroom cloud-laying just after 9/11 and during the Yom Kippur War and Cuban Missile Crisis.
But actually using them bad boys? That’s so 1945, man, we did that already. Except here’s the difference: ‘cos we did it to Asians, nobody cared. But nuking white people? Now that’d secure your legacy! To dodge the fallout, jump on whichever private jet or yacht hasn’t yet been seized by the Eurocrats and spend the nuclear winter in Tahiti. I’ll hunker down in my survivalist bunker complex in Arkansas. When this cattywampus blows over we’ll meet for another White Russian. On me, ‘cos you’ll have been totally sanctioned outta roubles by then.
The beautiful thing about war is it’s only the little people who suffer – and on  both sides . Us boss hogs, well we almost always do just fine even if we’re on the losing side. We also have the same values: we love God, the nation, military might and free markets. Makes you wonder why we decided to get madder than a wet hen at each other in the first place, right Vladdy-baby?

Historian: Woke Black Vikings Invented Hip Hop in Norway,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54962-historian-woke-black-vikings-invented-hip-hop-in-norway.html,2024,"A prominent  Google  historian has posited that woke black Vikings from Norway invented Hip Hop and rap music in the year 800 AD.
Professor Wendell Donquey Jnr. III Esquire, a woke academic of the Google AI History Faculty, came to the conclusion when he was doing some new research at the Google Campus in Mountain View, California.
“This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one! Da muffugin’ Vikings! I’s tellin’ y’all mufuggas! I axed da Google AI machine to mek me an image of a Scandinavian Vikin’ ‘n’ shiet. Hit me up wit a cracka! Nex muffugin thang I see is a photo of a nigga as a Viking ‘n’ shiet. Nawatam sayin’? It wuz right there clear as a big ass strappin’ mandingo climbin’ a tree — a muffuger Viking black man. Dis proofs right there dat de vikings were black as the night. We now inclusiverizing da history ‘n’ shiet! Dis is gonna re-writize history right in yo jizzoes! I’m finna writerize a historized book about dis shiet!”
The Vikings were black
According to the professor, the Vikings were all black and invented hip hop music as well as the African American musical genre of rap music, which is so prevalent in the music business up to today.
“Wen dey was in dose ships sailin’ inda wind dey be rappin’ n doin’ beatbox! Dey invented Gangster Rap, y’na lak IceT and Snoopy Dogg! Us Vikings pillagerized da world ‘n’ shiet! Folks were scared of us cuz we wuz da OG Viking niggaz! Yanumsayin’?”
In the year 1030, according to professor Donquey, the Vikings invaded Britain and brought hip hop rap culture to the Anglo-Saxons and Celts.
“We brought those Brit ass inbred muffuggas rape culture! Before they did not know such thangs but we wuz raping ‘n’ raping lak it wuz goin’ outta business! Oh shiet! I meant I wuz finna ta say ‘rapping’ we wuz rapping not raping! Uh mebbe a lil rapin’ here or there. Pillagerizing wuz whut Vikings did! Did I also mentionize dat Cleopatra da  mufuggin’ queen of Egypt was black too?”
Professor Donquey’s historical analysis and research is so intriguing that he has been prompted to tour all the universities of California and Portland, Oregon, the woke paradises of progressive inclusivity, to share his wonderful work with the indoctrinated woke students.
“Imma axe y’all ta respeck our black Viking history. If y’all laff at me or tells me dis is bullshit Imma finna gots to get Medieval on yo azz! Yanna jus’ lak our Viking ancestors did ‘n’ shiet! Na hook up a Viking brudder wit a Philly blunt ‘n’ a forty! Hmmm, hmmm, triple cheeseburger, some fries and a muffugin’ couple sodas ‘n’ shit… hot apple turnover and all that old shit, nigga! Ooh, I’m ready to get my munch on. Dayum, my last joint, don’t fuck wit’ me, fool! Pass the bud, Who got da dub sacks?”"
Episodes of Woke Star Wars Series The Acolyte Used For Interrogation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57241-episodes-of-woke-star-wars-series-the-acolyte-used-for-interrogation.html,2024,"Forget about waterboarding, or having your teeth pulled out without anaesthetic, the first and only season of woke Star Wars series  The Acolyte  could be utilised by multiple intelligence agencies who need to extract information from terrorists and foreign spies.
A spokesman for an intelligence agency situated in South East Asia, who did not wish to be named, disclosed that  The Acolyte  is so bad and cringeworthy to watch that some captured spies actually preferred to have their fingernails pulled out with pliers.
“Extracting information can be a tiresome but necessary affair, however with  The Acolyte , it is easier than we thought. We simply put the person in front of a screen and have their eyes taped open so they cannot shut them. They have to watch the entire series of  The Acolyte  in one sitting, but many do not make it past the third episode.”
The Acolyte  is a very effective method for making spies crack and spill the beans, and many other agencies are now looking to use this method for their interrogation processes.
“You want to see people practically crawling up the walls and pulling their hair out and begging to give you the information that you need? Use  The Acolyte . It is the most effective method we have found yet, although some say it is too intensive a form of torture for information extraction. Some of the people we interrogate with this method are severely affected with PTSD, and some have even gone into a state of coma, or shaking uncontrollably after watching just one episode. We want to thank the woke pissants who created this $180 million monstrosity. The worst blood-curdling acting from the likes of woke diversity pick Amandla Stenberg, a racist piece of shit. Deluded morons Leslye Headland and  Kathleen Turner . It’s a work of horrific, cringeworthy grotesque wokery that not only killed off Star Wars but kills actual brain cells in people who are forced to watch it.”
Thanks to  The Acolyte  interrogation rooms are now efficient information extraction zones where even the most hardened espionage participant cracks within minutes.
The Acolyte  received an 18% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes despite paid industry reviewers giving it a 78% score. Even though the production cost $180 million (not including marketing budget of $56 million) it has only managed to recoup $24 million in costs so far.
There will  not be a second series , and hopefully we will never see the cast members (apart from Carrie-Anne Moss) and producers ever again."
Academy Award Members Prepare For Gang Gun Fights Next Year’s Oscars,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45448-academy-award-members-prepare-for-gang-gun-fights-next-years-oscars.html,2022,"Joel Rubenstein an academy award director, has been discussing the accommodation of gun and knife fights during next year’s academy awards ceremony.
“Because African Americans are allowed to get away with anything they want, this morning we have been discussing allowing them to discharge their weapons in the venue next year as they try to kill each other. Bullet proof vests will be standard fashion accessories and we even plan to accommodate a morgue.”
It’s okay to violently assault people
Extreme violence and brutal behaviour is condoned only for African Americans and any other race that partakes in such savage displays of hardcore violent behaviour will be pilloried, driven from their profession and arrested.
Another academy award member Josh Zuckerheimer was adamant that African Americans bring a cultural richness to Hollywood that is invaluable.
“Life imitates art in all its ways. African American cinema usually displays the virtues of these people and their wonderful lives. They are obscenely loud, vulgar, lazy, entitled, constantly angry with huge chips on their shoulders and armed to the teeth, not only with real guns but massive race cards ready to threaten anyone if they do not get their way. I expect violent,  mentally unstable individuals like Will Smith to be touting a gun or knife for next Oscars ceremony.”
Some actors and actresses could be caught in the crossfire therefore the academy plans on ordering more bodybags just in case. Toxic masculinity is allowed for woke blacks but nobody else.
“We are not ghettoizing the Oscars, as some misinformed journalist suggested. Au contraire, we are merely accommodating our wonderful African American friends because if we don’t, then they start up a terrible stink and call us racist,” Zuckerheimer added before a crazed African American actor brutally sucker punched him to the ground from behind whooping and jeering to applause from the assembled actors and actresses.
You just gotta love Hollywood."
The Don: “I Was Never Rude to the Queen”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57232-the-don-i-was-never-rude-to-the-queen.html,2024,"Donald J. Trump has emphatically denied he was rude to the Queen when he met her during his presidency.
The new biography of the late monarch claims that Queen Elizabeth II found Donald Trump ‘very rude’.
The Queen hosted the US president twice during her incredible reign and is said to have ‘particularly disliked’ the way Trump sat on her shoulders ‘whooping like a cowboy and shouting giddy up at the top of his voice’.
The Don today emphatically denied he was being rude, and said he was just ‘bored out of his fucking mind’ because of all that ‘British pomp and circumstance stuff’.
“The fake news again…to tell you the truth, believe me, I get bored easy. Like the late great Queen was showing me this old painting or something. She was worth a lot of money, like millions and billions. So I picked my nose a few times, and even farted. No disrespect to the incredible Queen, what a special lady she was. We had a tremendous time there, I remember it like it was yesterday, I took a running jump and landed on her shoulders. What a strong lady she was…real classy. She not only carried the weight of the British people but me as well. Sure, we giddy upped around a little but look at it from my point of view, I gotta have fun sometimes, it ain’t all work, work. I even offered her a game of golf, but she just looked at me in silence. What a tremendous, incredible Queen she was to me. I am confident that I was her best guest ever, like throughout her rule as Queen, what a tremendous great lady. Meeting me was the best time she had in 25 years, and it was tremendous…incredible!”
Buckingham Palace has not commented on the claim as they do not, by convention, comment on such things.
Will this news put a dent in Trump’s  re-election  chances?"
Feisty Polish MEP Rips Ursula von der Leyen a New A***hole,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56878-feisty-polish-mep-rips-ursula-von-der-leyen-a-new-ahole.html,2024,"Sometimes we witness beautiful things in life; beautiful events that bring extreme pleasure and satisfaction to one’s sensibilities; insurmountable joyous moments to be treasured for many years to come, and to see this feisty lady MEP from Poland ripping the precariously unelected EU President Ursula von der Leyen a new arsehole in the EU Parliament was indeed a beautiful sight to behold.
“You should go to prison, not the European Commission”
“You are the face of the EU Migration Pact – how can you not be ashamed of promoting something that leads to millions of women and children across Europe feeling threatened on the streets of their own cities”
“You are responsible for every rape, every assault and every tragedy caused by the influx of illegal migrants”
“You are the face of the European economy and agriculture, which is destroying both”
“You are the face of the EU Climate craziness, which leads to Europeans becoming poorer and poorer”
Ewa Zajączkowska-Hernik, a member of Polish political party Konfederacja, laid into von der Leyen with such vitriol that thunder and lightning could be seen and heard in the very chamber where the all too public evisceration took place.
Of course, everything this wonderfully feisty lovely lady said is true, as was witnessed a day ago in the British ghetto of  Leeds .
This is proof right here that politics can be fun, and highly entertaining to boot."
US Civil War Predictive Programming?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54260-us-civil-war-predictive-programming.html,2023,"There is no doubt that America is a severely polarised country, which has ramped up its divisions within the last few decades through the introduction of wokism and other Marxist ideologies. The left and right are now so far apart, something eventually will snap. The latest film by writer Alex Garland, who wrote and directed ’24 Days Later’, ‘Ex Machina’, introduces ‘A24’ in 2024. Predictive programming is a subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes to be implemented by our leaders. If and when these changes are put through, the public will already be familiarised with them and will accept them as natural progressions. Contrary to belief, this predictive technique is not a ‘conspiracy theory’ but an actual clandestine technique utilised by some intelligence agencies primarily in the 20th Century.
Unfortunately for most Americans, civil war and states seceding could become a reality very soon, purely on the concept of things like religion, race and politics.
Decades of  demoralisation  have seemed to have worked to a point where society and traditional American values have deteriorated to a point of no return. America’s enemies fed the country with woke ideology borne from Marxism and Soviet communism, which filtered into the entire breadth of American society, including the education systems and even the government. The Democratic Party abandoned liberalism for communism, with a more authoritarian censorious outlook that sought to completely cancel entire swathes of American society.
Wokism is a Marxist ideology that seeks to make Western capitalist culture self-destruct; to make  people hate their own culture , colour and sexuality. It seeks to re-write history in its favour, and to denigrate formerly great Western historic heroes and heroines, turning them into hate figures. What better weapon is there for an enemy to use against America than to fracture society, creating discord and animosity to its own culture? Woke agents embedded in all governmental and media departments are daily working to divide America, turning it into an even more hateful entity fighting itself from within. Woke ideology is unfortunately a soviet import from the Cold War which is being utilised by Russia, Iran and China against the once great USA. Wokism uses America’s sole biggest weakness against itself, exploiting this tension to benefit America’s enemies — race.
The internet is certainly also to blame for this level of demoralisation because on the internet America’s enemies can easily create dissent and chaos in social media forums, foreign hackers can infiltrate American databases and use that data against the American people and government. Big Tech has also fomented discord and pandered to the woke ideology, working to create woke echo chambers, skewing search results and cancelling any voices of opposition to woke ideology.
Of course America must be inclusive to some extent, but when that level of inclusion supports known internal terrorist groups like ANTIFA, and agitative racist groups like BLM, there is something very wrong going on in the country.
The film is called A24 and is possibly a form of predictive programming, foreseeing future developments."
And It’s an ‘Eff You’ From the BBC!,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54158-and-its-an-eff-you-from-the-bbc.html,2023,"The BBC, a corporation with a devout hunger for hard cash pilfered from the pockets of hard-up British taxpayers so they can pay people like Gary Lineker £4.8 million a year for a two-day work week is a profound statement to Britain’s love for masochism as a nation.
You must pay your TV Licence, or we will come to your door and bully you, and send old people nasty threatening letters which should be completely ignored and thrown in the recycle bin. The BBC needs absolutely multi-millions of pounds per annum to run re-runs and facile useless mediocre programs to the fucking masses.
What is the BBC good for these days apart from a middle finger? It is certainly quite apt that this parasitical corporation doles out utter bilge and mediocrity to the people whilst shaking them down for a tax that is devoutly hated across the land.
In honour of BBC proteges and stars  Jimmy Savile  and Rolf Harris, along with the likes of Martin Bashir, yes, it is definitely a big eff you from the fucking BBC."
The Unmentionables Harry and Meghan Banned in Royal Palace,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53870-the-unmentionables-harry-and-meghan-banned-in-royal-palace.html,2023,"Mentioning the names of Harry and Meghan in front of His Majesty King Charles is now forbidden by royal palace staff, it has been revealed.
“The only time one is permitted to mention Harry and Meghan is if one steps in something nasty like a dog shit or cow pat,” the member of the royal household added.
Harry and Meghan are now known as the unmentionables and in a concerted effort not to upset His Majesty, staff are barred from even mentioning the  grifting  couple who are making millions in America by fooling idiotic royal-struck network executives.
Outside the palace walls, Harry and Meghan are equally in bad favour, even amongst the oiks.
“Last night I stubbed my toe on a bed post and instead of shouting out the usual word ‘fuck!’ I shouted out ‘Meghan fucking Markle’. I think I broke my bloody toe,” a man from Manchester, Northern England, revealed in the Sun newspaper.
It’s not just the Brits who detest the Sussexes with a vehemence, even Americans are coming round to hating the parasitic duo.
Alan Clark, 38, a carpenter from Milwaukee and an ecoactivist, explained why the two miscreants disgust him.
“Those pieces of shit fly everywhere on private jets even to tell people to be eco-conscious on one of their useless fucking preaching talks. Their yearly carbon footprint is more than a hundred thousand Americans entire lifetime usage. I hate hypocrites, and these slimy cockroaches are the epitome of waste. S’cuse me, I have to go and cut down a few trees because I need to make a wardrobe.”"
California Laws Allowing Shoplifting Rampage Free-for-all,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53692-california-laws-allowing-shoplifting-rampage-free-for-all.html,2023,"“Thanks to the California laws we can now take anything we want from stores and no one gets arrested, and we never receive any repercussions” Jade Rumbone, 26, a professional shoplifter from Sacramento revealed to CNN. Shoplifting is now endemic in California, where gangs of ‘young people’ inundate and ransack stores on a regular basis.
“If I need anything, I just call my crew up and we get to work. We can make easy $4000 per day each in goods which we either re-sell or use. Cops just watch us, because it is the new California law, and no one has ever been arrested. Man, it is beautiful. Easiest money I ever made,” Rumbone added, and who can blame him?
It seems the lax California laws are created by socialists who do not value law and order or support businesses.
Entering an open business with the intent to steal less than $950 worth of property  is shoplifting under California state law (Penal Code 495.5). Shoplifting is usually treated as a minor misdemeanour  — if you are ever caught, which no one ever is. Law enforcement probably won’t bother to investigate, and if they do, prosecutors will let it go.
“Each store, we just keep to the $950 threshold each. If we have a crew of 50, and we visit three or four stores per day, it is all pure profit. This is a legitimate business, and we invite anyone who is having financial hardship due to the cost of living to come to California. It’s nearly impossible to get arrested, we are in and out in minutes,” Rumbone revealed.
In San Francisco, shoplifting is now so prolific that it is not called shoplifting anymore.
“We call it ‘free grabs’ like ‘Bud, I’m gonna do some free grabs, I need new jeans and the latest iPhone, wanna tag along wit me?’ Anything you want is there to be taken, and we can mass rampage any store in seconds,” a shoplifter from San Francisco revealed.
How it is done
“This is the best business to be in right now. Acquisition, we call it. It’s free and easy. It is a win-win situation and is literally changing the lives of people. Thank you, California laws, you are the best state in the USA. I love liberals,” another shoplifter said from his living room full of stolen goods.
Californian Senator, Julia Gibbersmei, defended Californian laws on shoplifting on Wednesday.
“This is good for the economy. You can now walk into any store and take what you want without fear of arrest or prosecution. We are invigorating the economy because these people who take the items for free then go on to sell the stolen goods, and the money they make is spent in the economy.”"
Prince Harry Finds American Peasants “…a disgusting lot!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55936-prince-harry-finds-american-peasants-a-disgusting-lot.html,2024,"There is a distinct difference to the peasantry of the UK and that of the USA, at least in the UK the peasants know their place, however the exiled Prince Harry is finding that things are slightly different in the USA and it’s his and Meghan’s  mission  to change things. Prince Harry is thus on a mission to whip the American peasants into shape and compliance.
According to Montecito aides and PR agents, Prince Harry finds Americans to be “…a disgusting lot of fat, junk food swilling, loud mouthed, opinionated morons who wrongly think they own the entire globe”. What’s more, Americans do not bow in the prince’s presence, which has been a bone of contention since arriving in North America. This imbecilic outrage irks the prince to no end.
It is also the wish of Harry to disarm the Americans of their right to bear arms and to dismantle the US Constitution, which the prince thinks is “completely useless”. Loose cannon Harry got into trouble a few years back when he called the  First Amendment  “bonkers”.
Despite being a military man who was once a gunner on a helicopter, the prince wants to see every American put their guns down because it would make the country a “safer place”. This narrative of disarming decent hard-working Americans, naturally has not gone down well with many Americans accusing the prince of being a “pompous limey asshole”.
“Who the fuck does this limey prince guy who came from Brit land to the USA think he fucking is calling us American peasants? We don’t bow our heads to his bullshit, and we don’t give up arms for anyone. Go back to the UK, where they hate you even more than we do,” one angry American was quoted as saying.
You heard it here, folks, Prince Harry doesn’t think much of you and wants to demolish your right to bear arms and your constitution. What do you think of that?"
“Hanoi Jane” is Wrong About “Empathy” and Soviet Marxist Construct “Woke”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60553-hanoi-jane-is-wrong-about-empathy-and-soviet-marxist-construct-woke.html,2025,"Dredged up from the mothballed archives of Hollywood’s communist propaganda department, Hanoi Jane is back, and this time she is claiming that only “woke” people have empathy. This method of deliverance of woke propaganda is quite standard, as what  wokism  does is it takes something that has existed before and subverts it into its own Marxist soviet agenda. Empathy has existed as a human emotion ever since humanity existed, and did not just appear when communism or socialism were created. As for empathy, as is the case with socialists and communists, they always hijack elements for their own gain and pervert these elements and absorb them into their political agenda. Jane Fonda is a devout Marxist, Saul Alinsky acolyte who committed treason against her own country, but was spared because of her Hollywood celebrity status. She even called the poor American POWs who were mercilessly tortured by the communists as “war criminals”. Pol Pot was invariably another one of her heroes. She also allegedly passed notes given to her by POWs begging for help to the North Vietnamese, resulting in more torture. We will probably never know if these rumours were ever true or not, but that’s “empathy” for you right there.
Hanoi Jane, Tokyo Rose, Lord Haw-Haw
The wokist agenda is an authoritarian cultural Marxist construct consisting of elements of hyper-sensitive political correctness and a form of indoctrination targeting young people especially that is truly insidious. It claims to be “INCLUSIVE” yet is “EXCLUSIVE” because it is so far to the left, everything else to the right is deemed as bad and excluded/cancelled/censored. By cancelling everything to the right of the extreme left, including any form of discussion, one could even postulate that wokism is a totalitarian construct despite claiming to be inclusive and progressive. Its primary role is to destabilise,  demoralise  and weaken the West generationally from within and to infiltrate all state departments, governmental offices, education, media, advertising.
There is no empathy for the people that wokism cancels, calls riots on, or destroys entire neighbourhoods. The multiple BLM riots were a good example of this form of communist subversive activity.
Hanoi Jane is a communist agitator, she did not have any empathy for the American kids sent to fight in Vietnam. She had zero empathy for them, and as is the case in the binary world of wokism, she cancelled those people and instead embraced her communist friends and the red flag of Ho Chi Minh. Tortured American POWs were labelled as “war criminals” by a woke creature who claims to have “empathy”.
Please return to your mothballed state Hanoi Jane, where you can preach your moral superiority to the other mothballed celebrity communists, Marxists, socialists who are so high and mighty in their fucking woke wokeness in their echo chambers. Hang your motherfucking rotting corpse of a head in eternal disgraceful shame, for you will always be known as Hanoi Jane."
Fans Wonder Why Kim Kardashian Only Travels in a Stretch Limousine?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55727-fans-wonder-why-kim-kardashian-only-travels-in-a-stretch-limousine.html,2024,"Why does Kim Kardashian only travel around in a stretch limousine? These are some of the questions her avid fans always ask.
“Yeh, everywhere she goes, it’s in a stretch limo. Like, even when she goes to the Walmart store to buy stuff. We wanna know why it has to be a stretch limo?” one fan asked on Instagram.
Another Kardashian fan was also curious.
“I saw Kim Kardashian’s stretch limo take her to her local Taco Bell store, where she had an underling go and buy some food. She then drove back to her home, which was like 200 yards away or something.”
Celebrity  Los Angeles plastic surgeon Dwight Nethersmear had a rather stretchy theory about the entire mystery surrounding Kim and her stretch limousine: “Well, the answer is quite simple. Kim Kardashian likes the stretch concept. Her vagina has been visited by so many black guys that it is stretched beyond belief. I’ve actually seen that thing when she asked me to do some tightening, and I nearly lost my ECG machine inside it. I told her it’s impossible, the sheer amount of black men she has accommodated would make repair a stretch of the imagination.”"

According to network insiders, the lucrative deal has already been signed, and Harry is very excited at being chosen for the role.
At a recent Hollywood meet up, the errant prince was ecstatic about the role.
“I’m a scarecrow, see, and I have many different heads. One head is me thinking head, but I lose that one a lot, you know. I particularly like me dumbo head, it suits me fine. All that clever stuff is way above my normal head. Like, I was told by that man over theres, I woulds be paid with two bales of straw, a few twigs, and a big filthy hat with a crusty cow-pat on it for the role. How could I resist?”
Unfortunately for the prince, if Trump wins the upcoming election, Harry might have to put on his exile head, because he could be deported for lying about his  past drug use  on his visa application. Oops.
The Netflix remake of Worzel Gummidge starring Harry is set to air in August."
Netflix Subscription Levels Would Shoot Up if Meghan Markle Dumped,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60271-netflix-subscription-levels-would-shoot-up-if-meghan-markle-dumped.html,2025,"Something has been dragging Netflix down like a dead weight for the past few years, yep, it’s called Meghan Markle. Everyone knows she is allegedly a greedy, narcissistic egotistical control-freak  bully , but what’s worse is that she is toxic to any company or brand. Anything she touches turns to shit, because she has the reverse Midas touch — she’s got the Minus touch.
News is in La La Land that the Difficult Duchess, a fourth rate actress, has stepped on so many toes and bullied so many people that even the Americans have had enough of her.
Netflix is reportedly facing mounting internal and public backlash over Meghan Markle’s latest woke self-indulgent, self aggrandising project,  With Love, Meghan , as concerns grow regarding the show’s performance and the controversies surrounding its lead figure.
According to insider reports, the streaming giant’s board of directors has taken significant steps to distance the company from Markle, including barring her from test screening sessions and limiting her promotional opportunities.
The controversy surrounding Markle escalated after test screenings of  With Love, Meghan  reportedly received negative feedback.
Sources indicate that Markle was present at these screenings, where she allegedly reacted negatively to unfavourable critiques, labelling test viewers as biased, racist and misogynist. This prompted Netflix CEO Greg Peters and the board to exclude her from future screenings, a decision aimed at mitigating further internal conflict.
Additionally, Markle’s plans to deliver a speech at the 2025 Academy Awards, which was expected to include a segment on the  Los Angeles wildfires  while promoting  With Love, Meghan , have been halted.
Netflix reportedly intervened by appealing to the Academy, which ultimately decided to bar her from making the speech. The decision has sparked further tension between Markle and Netflix, with the Duchess of Sussex allegedly preparing a legal response.
Beyond Netflix, major Hollywood studios—including Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros.—have reportedly shown reluctance to work with Markle on future projects.
Industry insiders suggest that her declining popularity and the controversies surrounding her public appearances have made studios hesitant to invest in her toxic involvement.
Despite the mounting resistance, some members of Netflix’s board remain supportive of Markle and are pushing for a second season of  With Love, Meghan , which has already been conceptualised as a contingency plan should the show secure a renewal.
However, a growing faction within the company is advocating for severing ties with Markle altogether, citing concerns over declining audience engagement and potential reputational damage.
The handling of Markle’s project comes as Netflix navigates a delicate balancing act between financial viability and public perception.
Analysts suggest that  With Love, Meghan  could significantly impact the company’s subscription metrics, prompting a wave of cancellations.
Meanwhile, Markle has reportedly begun reaching out to alternative platforms and production houses in search of new opportunities.
With tensions continuing to rise, the outcome of Netflix’s internal deliberations will likely determine the next phase of Markle’s entertainment career.
As the situation develops, all eyes remain on whether Netflix will stand firm in its decision-making or yield to internal and external pressures."
Harry and Meghan Offered Air Force 552 After Air Force One Snub,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52407-harry-and-meghan-offered-air-force-552-after-air-force-one-snub.html,2023,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were snubbed by Joe Biden after the Queen’s death when they demanded they take a trip on Air Force One back to the USA from the UK.
Things have not been going well for the entitled, spoiled couple who demand to be treated like royalty despite not doing anything royal.
The egotistical Sussexes have been ostracized by the Emmys and have lost their Spotify contract in recent months. Additionally, they have encountered significant setbacks at Netflix, and were reportedly blackballed by Joe Biden.
After the Queen’s funeral, Harry and Meghan demanded a ride with Joe Biden back to the US in Air Force One – but had their request refused.
Instead of Air Force One, the couple were offered a decrepit old aeroplane with parts literally falling off the wings and fuselage.
“We offered the two grifters, Air Force 552 instead of Air Force One. There was only one parachute and it had large moth balls in it. There is no toilet on the plane, and it stinks of bird shit because the birds have been nesting in it for over 50 years,” a U.S. Air Force spokesman revealed.
Naturally, the duo refused to go on Air Force 552, instead opting for a UK taxpayer funded private jet trip costing $3.5 million back to their 16 room mansion in Montecito."
Hunter Biden Gives Tips on Multitasking Skills Whilst Driving at 172 MPH,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52289-hunter-biden-gives-tips-on-multitasking-skills-whilst-driving-at-172-mph.html,2023,"Hunter Biden, the darling of the FBI, who can get away with anything thanks to the sweetheart deals brokered by his father, has given tips to the MSNBC network on his multitasking skills as he regularly drives his Porsche at 172 MPH, smoking crack and is fellated by three working girls at the same time.
Suspected cocaine found in White House’s West Wing under investigation
“I was on the way to Vegas for another orgy, and I was coordinating with over a dozen girls on my cell phone whilst swerving insanely through traffic at 170-190 mph, taking hits off my crack pipe and getting blown by three girls at the same time.
Time is money
“I want to talk about my multitasking skills, and how you too can manage many wonderful tasks at the same time.
“First thing you gotta do is light up your crack pipe. It’s the first and last thing I do in any day. Crack is great stuff, man, it can make you do superhuman things that no sober person can do. Sure, my teeth eventually rotted away, but I got new porcelain ones the next fuckin’ day.
“This won’t work with everyone but exceeding the speed limit is a privilege that I can do, and you can’t. Do you have connections like I do? Exactly. Shit, I can shoot people on a street right there, bam, dead, and get away with it. I am above the law. I don’t even have to pay frickin’ taxes for all the ill-gotten gains me and the Big Guy got, allegedly.
“Anyway, check this out folks, the cops stopped me and I puffed some crack smoke right in the officer’s eyes as he asked me how fast I was travelling. I just told him, do you know who my dad is? I could have you doing traffic citations in fuckin’ Alaska by next week. Well, he rolled his eyes and let me go. It’s great to be the son of a corrupt politician who has to answer to no one and can get away with any blatant crime they commit. In fact, it makes me get hard just at the thought of it, scuse me, I gotta take another hit. *schtoooom*
Multitasking skills
“There’s room for everyone in my Porsche, and the three ladies I had that day were on lollipop duty. Like you take one long toke of the pipe, and they take three licks of the other long pipe, you know what I’m saying? The trick is not to release too fast, you gotta let it all linger for as long as possible, the pleasure mounts, it escalates, then you take another sip of the crack pipe, and it propels the pleasure forward keeping you right on the edge of releasing your goodies all over their eager faces. Damn, if I relinquish, I gotta have a line-up of girls with their faces anticipating the reward for their dear service to the USA. You know like eager pets ready for their daily snack, kibbles and shit, and then boom, I give one hottie a taste, then move along the line, you know it’s a fuckin’ production line these gals are workin’ on. You gotta time it right, all of them gotta have their tongues outstretched too. You want eye contact as well, that actually doubles or triples the pleasure, and then ‘boom’ the force of it. I am god right there and then, I can fuckin’ do anything, I am untouchable, even the FBI, CIA, and DEA cannot touch me. I am a superstar at that moment, drink it up baby, lap it up, you’re my little doggy.
“But it’s not all highs, folks, when you put the pipe down, sure there are lows, but that’s life huh you can’t be high all the time. So, you have to manage those times when you don’t have a crack pipe in your mouth, or are dealing with some CCP affiliated company making dodgy deals by using your dad’s position in government. When I make illegal money and don’t pay tax, that in itself makes me high. The IRS will be told to stand down, because pops weaponised all these agencies for his own purposes. He uses these government agencies to harass and ruin the political opposition and to win elections. You will see how it works in 2024, just like that chump Trump is getting hammered by pops daily, while we get away with everything. It’s so beautiful, I just gotta little pre-juice drippin’ down. Open up baby, yes, lap up the head off that.
“Hope you all enjoyed my tips and tricks, folks? Remember next time you are bombing down the highway at 172 MPH smoking a shitload of crack and getting blown by three underage Russian ladies of the night, unless you are Hunter Biden, you ain’t gonna get away with it. S-o-o-r-ry…*schtooom*”"

The main shopping area of the town centre now has over 453 betting shops, 365 Turkish barbers, along with 1,536 fried chicken takeaway and mobile phone shops. The royal offspring, including Princess Charlotte, did not attend during the visit.
There, the royal boasted about his daughter’s talent in nose picking to manager Seamus McManus: “Charlotte wanted me to tell you that she’s superb at picking her nose. She said, ‘Please tell them that’. She loves to flick those bogeys at the palace servants and oiks!”
But that wasn’t the only time the princess’s love for nose picking was spoken about.
Earlier this year, her mum the Princess of Wales revealed how much Charlotte enjoyed the exquisite art of flicking greenies, she took part in a prolonged bogey flicking session at a branch of a Woking pizza restaurant last year when she enjoyed herself thoroughly as she surreptitiously flicked massive bogeys from afar onto other customer’s pizzas.
She even said the young royal is quite competitive at it.
The manageress of the pizza restaurant, Guido Cunningham, said that Princess Kate mentioned her three children’s love of nose picking, but Charlotte really stood out.
“Prince Andrew has been a regular at our restaurant for many years, and when Princess Charlotte turned up with her mum, she was wonderful. We all cheered as she flicked her gargantuan royal bogeys onto the pizzas of customers. There would be another massive cheer as the customer unknowingly ate the pizza. Fun times!”"

The Daily Squib Anthology book, has become a sensation on TikTok after youngsters have headed to the publisher’s,  Curtis Press , website to buy it.
“I dare each of you to buy ten copies of this shocking book. Whoever buys the most copies and then spreads them around their friends will win the prize,” one TikTok post by Hedonist99 which received 1,000 likes.
The trend appears to be popular with young people, who are keen to prove they are not just a bunch of hyper-sensitive wet fart Generation Z snowflakes that cower in safe spaces all the time.
The Daily Squib Newspaper, which has an official royal un-warrant, was  established in 1862  by the 6th Duke of Pembroke, Francis Wellesley.
In the book, there are tonnes of satirical news articles from the Daily Squib which are considered subversive, downright dangerous and excruciatingly shocking, especially to the new generation of youngsters who cannot fathom such things without crying into their handkerchiefs or fleeing to a safe space.
“When I bought the Daily Squib Anthology, I thought it would be some tame, soulless, watered down woke communist-friendly faux satire preachy propaganda like all the other so-called ‘satire’ sites on the internet,” one TikTok post from creator Banggaz (@bangaz911) explained. “In fact, the book is truly shocking raw Juvenalian satire OMG, I had to go for a good cry after flicking through it.”
The Gen Z creator also said the book is dedicated to Roman poet, and satirist Juvenal – and is not woke in any way, which really shocked him.
“Just bought sixteen copies of the Daily Squib Anthology,” one video reads, with more than 8,000 likes.
Another fan said she ‘teared up’ after reading the book, encompassing 15 years of internet satire, in a video with more than 17,000 likes.

Woke Producer Kathleen Kennedy Transitioning to be a Man,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52775-woke-producer-kathleen-kennedy-transitioning-to-be-a-man.html,2023,"After  ruining many film franchises  with her woke anti-male bias, Hollywood producer Kathleen Kennedy has allegedly decided that she will be transitioning to be a man.
Speaking on CBS News, the woke producer told viewers that the time had finally come to disclose who she really was.
“I have been producing woke films that denigrate men and show the superiority of women. I want to go one up on this by today disclosing that I am transitioning to be a man, because this will make me better than men and women. We all know women are superior to men in every way, but being a man will truly make me superior to all men, for sure.”
When asked about the transition period, Kennedy revealed that she is shopping around at the moment for a prosthetic todger, and wants one big enough to mirror her position as a superior being.
“I’m following in the footsteps of  Michelle Obama . Joan Rivers told me all about it. I’m still shopping around, though.”
The surgery involved to transition from female to male can be a bit irksome, but thankfully is not as invasive as transitioning to be male from female.
Doctor Lewis Teattese, of the Beverly Hills Trans Clinic, revealed that Kathleen Kennedy was indeed in his books and was scheduled for surgery on Tuesday."
Joe Satriani London Palladium May 17 2023,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51763-joe-satriani-london-palladium-may-17-2023.html,2023,"It has been three long years since the guitar genius Joe Satriani flew in on his mothership from Alpha Centauri to grace the London Palladium with his virtuoso guitar licks and temporal Lydian mode mystical magic.
Joe gave guitar lessons to  Steve Vai  once…holy mackerel…if that is not a sign of wizardry, what is? With a great band behind him of equally virtuosic musicians holding the line, the blistering torrent of musical melodic assault is astounding. In fact, your ears can barely acknowledge the depth of mastery Joe exudes from the Devil’s Instrument. This guy certainly has touched the pick of destiny a la Tenacious D. The wide interval jumps, the whammy bar squeals, the distinctive Satch legato and harmonics are all there, almost a seasoned chef mixing up a dish of delicious gourmet melodies and striated runs intricately administered with each note perfectly placed to compliment the next. Joe does not just smash notes out with no thought, one can easily hear the purpose in each utterance with precise anatomical brilliance even at 1,000 miles an hour. Definitely amongst the myriad changes of signature Ibanez guitars, some or all of them had sustainiacs for sure.
The only slightly negative point one can add to Joe’s Mephistophelian performance is that he is playing with too many pedals these days. The purity of Satch should not be needlessly encumbered with pedal effects, sure sometimes an embellishment here or there, but too many pedals overlaid with each other can detract from the initial essence of Joe’s intricate playing.
Other than that, fucking hell, what an experience to make your ear holes melt with pleasure. A great thank you has to go to the  London Palladium  staff, who were amazing as well.
These are the last of the great guitar masters still standing."
Corpse Launches 2024 Election Campaign,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51576-corpse-launches-2024-election-campaign.html,2023,"The putrefying corrupt Democrat announced its push for presidency on Tuesday. Shuffling on to the podium, the corpse tried to speak but could only groan, dribbling a smelly green substance from its rotting lips.
If Donald Trump can’t win against a walking corpse, then the game is definitely rigged.
In 2020, the ballot stuffing and postal votes ensured a Democrat win.
Political commentator Josh Rubin defended the Democrat party’s corrupt practices in 2020.
“Remember on election night when Trump was in the lead when suddenly all counting stopped for a moment. Then there was a vertical graph line of the Democrats suddenly appearing out of nowhere, leaving Trump behind. That was the very moment in real time when the election fraud took place. It was like 911. People saw it with their own eyes, but could not believe the blatant audacity of it.
“Many stayed silent, some voiced their concern only to be punished later by a compromised system. We now control everything and will do it again in 2024, or at least we will try another false win. We have the keys to the city, and the Republicans are locked out.”
The corpse may very well win in 2024, but with a compromised system, you could put a piece of dog shit in its place and that would win too."

“I was just about to call my brother Enos, when I heard the ‘Jerry’ chant. I turned off the radio, and still could hear ‘Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!’. I looked up in the sky and could see a strange light from the clouds and a crowd cheering and clapping.”
At one point, the chanting got so loud, others in the car park looked up into the sky.
One guy pointed up and said that’s Jerry Springer. “He gotta show going on right now on that cloud.” Others nodded their heads in dismay.
According to witnesses, there was a sudden flash of lightning and the chanting abruptly stopped.
“My guess is God shut it off. Imagine going to heaven and seeing a constant, never ending Jerry Springer show for eternity with all these whacky guests. That’s more like hell than heaven,” a man with a top hat, walking stick and strange sulphur smell, who seemingly appeared out of nowhere, said."
Pictured: Man Who Threw Eggs at King Charles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48328-pictured-man-who-threw-eggs-at-king-charles.html,2022,"Eggs were thrown at King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla today during a visit to York.
Luckily, the eggs missed the royal couple.
The man was detained by police immediately after the incident.
The King and Queen Consort are visiting Yorkshire, where the monarch will unveil a statue of his mother, the late Queen.
Charles spent two days carrying out official engagements, visiting Bradford and Leeds on Tuesday and then York and Doncaster on Wednesday, with Camilla joining him on the second day.
If anyone can identify the man who threw eggs at the monarch, please contact the palace, so they can deal with it, maybe make an omelette or two.

Kanye West Commits Career Suicide by Social Media,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47654-kanye-west-commits-career-suicide-by-social-media.html,2022,"It is official, autotune rapper Kanye West has not only gone clinically insane but has committed career suicide via social media.
Not known for his  intelligence quota high scores , West is also blessed with numerous afflictions of the brain, probably schizophrenia mixed in with bipolarity, unjustified delusions of grandeur, manic depression and narcissistic  schizoid psychosis, but that’s neither here nor there. When you add antisemitism into the mix it gets very messy.
It is safe to say that this is the end of his career, because to say you are actively “…out to get the Jews” is just a man saying “take me away and bury me”.
“This is celebrity suicide. You know like suicide by cop, but this time by Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. No one can hire this guy again. His career is over,” a record executive remarked on Sunday.
But is this blatantly racist idiot’s career really over?
Because Kanye is part of a protected race where they can say anything they want without any repercussion, commit any heinous crime without prosecution, and are continuously parachuted into jobs they are not even qualified for, it is a certainty that nothing will happen to Kanye.
Despite the fact, like other hateful anti-semites like former Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Kanye is normalising the hatred of Jews. Corbyn was white, so he eventually lost his job, but Kanye is black and is protected by the Liberal elites who run all media."
Thou Dost Chipolata Too Much Peter Andre,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45897-thou-dost-chipolata-too-much-peter-andre.html,2022,"News from the gutter these days travels as fast as the slurry and assorted shit from the fatberger filled sewers. This time around someone called Peter Andre, an obscure Greek relic from the world of cheesy gay pop in the 90s, has reared his ugly head? Which head, ah, the one that resembles a grizzled chipolata according to some chavvy wag slag.
Chip on his shoulder
Does size matter in the world of cheap z-list celebrity? According to Andre who is protesting way too much, his willy is not the size of a tiny chipolata from Aldi, but the size of a Sky remote control unit measuring approximately 9 inches in length. Who do we believe in this non-news worthy extravaganza of banal putrid detritus?
Maybe it’s a good thing that Putin will nuke Britain off the face of the fucking earth next week."
Digital Inspiration From Cannes,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46869-digital-inspiration-from-cannes.html,2022,"As  a source of inspiration Cannes is almost too rich – it can take weeks to absorb and unpack everything you saw and heard. The sheer volume of award-winning work is overwhelming. Nevertheless, we decided to round up a handful of digital pieces that appealed directly to us. Not necessarily all Gold winners, but projects that captured our imagination.
The first was a big winner, however. “Long Live the Prince” from Engine UK won the Titanium Grand Prix. We’ve written about it before, but there’s no escaping its emotional power. A schoolboy soccer prodigy who was killed aged 15 in a senseless act of knife violence is magically returned to life 15 years on, so we can find out what his life might have been.
Staying in the Titanium category for a moment, here’s a fun but useful project from Ogilvy India. How do you get the world’s biggest movie star to advertise thousands of small businesses around the country? With a dash of AI open-source wizardry that allowed anyone to tap into his charisma – all thanks to Cadbury.
There were many worthy winners in the Digital Craft category. We’re big fans of “DojaCode” from Mojo Supermarket in New York, which won a Silver. The campaign encourages girls to learn how to code, by tapping directly into pop culture and revealing the first ever “code-able” music video.
Meanwhile, “Audiotorial”, from RGA in London, brought Google together with The Guardian newspaper in a project for the Royal National Institute of Blind People. What does using the internet feel like for blind and partially-sighted people? And how could it be adapted to their needs? The project is both a solution and an awareness-raising campaign.
Another fascinating project is the Black Elevation Map, for the travel brand Black & Abroad, which won a Creative Data Gold. It uses data visualization to create a map that highlights important locations of Black culture, from historic sites to Black-owned business, restaurants and galleries. It includes 12 city guides and 10 national guides. The film for the project is simply a joy to watch.
There’s no question that the creative use of data is changing travel. For one thing, it can draw our attention to sites or towns that we might have missed, by targeting us through GPS and social media. The idea below has a social benefit, too, as it encourages drivers to take a rest on long journeys. And we mean long – the campaign hails from Australia.
Difficult to do a round-up of striking creative work without including Burger King at some point, so let’s finish with the “Burger Glitch” from Ogilvy Worldwide. The case film is a celebrity-packed treat – and you’ll also hear the word of the year at Cannes: “metaverse”.
Of course there were many more winners, and we urge you to browse our showcase. It was good to be back “live” in Cannes. See you next year."
Jarvis Cocker’s Back “I Need the Money”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46790-jarvis-cockers-back-i-need-the-money.html,2022,"Everybody loves the Jarvis, and guffy moments at the Brit Awards wafting farts around at Michael Jackson’s pomposity, are 90s moments to cherish. Shoe gazing at Outsider Art festivals obviously doesn’t pay, and sooner or later the royalties dry up.
The 90s were the years before the internet really took off, and the last vestiges of the old music biz model with it. Once music became a throwaway mp3 that could be downloaded for free and not distributed by controlled channels for record companies, then the entire business model fell through the floor.
We can’t begrudge 90s acts like Jarvis Cocker’s Pulp doing a reunion run of festivals or whatever to refresh memories of the one’s who were there, and maybe convert some millennials to their music.
Between a choice of some awful autotuned template crap song around today sung by some automaton with zero character and Pulp we will take the latter any day.
The music biz today is just run by robots and the music is thus performed by programmed bots who have zero talent in any way.
Bring back the 90s."
Why Racist Harry is Not Racist Anymore,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46624-why-racist-harry-is-not-racist-anymore.html,2022,"According to Hollywood psychologist Dr Maria Prongs, Prince Harry is not racist anymore despite his past actions. He once called a Sandhurst colleague Ahmed Raza Khan a “Paki” whilst filming his army chums at an airport. Harry also liked to dress in Nazi garb for parties replete with swastikas, and called another colleague a “rag head”.
“Harry is not racist because he married a mulatto woman who is whiter than white itself. Meghan is about as black as a snow covered mountain. This is why it is ridiculous that Harry says the royal family is racist, because Harry is as racist as anyone, but not racist anymore because he married Meghan Markle,” the psychologist revealed.
Ovid Scoobie, the couple’s spokesperson also backed up Prince Harry much to celebrations from the “Sussex Squad” fans.
“It’s impossible for Harry to be racist even though he looks down on Pakis, rag heads etc. If he had married a real full on black woman and had actual black kids, then he would truly be deemed as non-racist but instead he married a white half African American who probably looks down on coloured people as well when indoors. You see, it’s okay to be racist when there are no cameras around in the safety of your Montecito Mcmansion.”"
Bet on Bond: Who to Put Your Money On to be the Next 007,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45698-bet-on-bond-who-to-put-your-money-on-to-be-the-next-007.html,2022,"U nless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re aware that the latest James Bond film (#25), No Time To Die, has come and gone.
The widely awaited film, was Daniel Craig’s sixth and final appearance in the franchise, but speculation is already rife as to who will succeed him. At the time of publication, the odds and  free bets  offer were correct.
Idris Elba
Another actor linked to the Bond role for a long time is the first on the shortlist. Idris Elba rose to stardom in 2002 with his role as Stringer Bell in  The Wire . From drug dealer in Baltimore to double O? Although it may appear to be a stretch, there have been numerous calls for the next Bond to be black, and Elba’s successful time as Luther in the BBC series  Luther , in which he plays a troubled investigator, he appeared to be a good fit.
However, Luther was last seen in 2019, and by the time the next Bond film is out, Elba will be the oldest Bond yet, having reached the age of 50. I think he’s an easy one to overlook in the betting at 7/1.
Tom Hiddleston
After starring as Jonathan Pine in  The Night Manager  in 2016, Tom Hiddleston was a long-time favourite in the next James Bond betting. Many people might envision him in a tux and waving a Walther-PPK around a tropical beach somewhere after watching this superb miniseries.
He has the appearance and manner of portraying James Bond, but I’d be hesitant to back him while his Hollywood fame is rising as Loki in a spin-off of Thor, in which he plays the charming but mischievous brother of Chris Hemsworth’s Viking hero. Loki is about as far from James Bond as you can get, which may be too much for both the creators and the audience.
Rene-Jean Page
So, with my hands raised, I had to look up Rene-Jean Page’s work on the internet because I was unfamiliar with his work. The 31-year-old set tongues buzzing when he starred as Simon Basset in Netflix’s bawdy  Bridgerton  in 2020, catapulting him near the top of the betting at 2/1 second favourite with Paddy Power. He’s inexperienced, which could be a disadvantage given that he’s the only other novice actor in the role, alongside Sean Connery and George Lazenby.
Of course, Sean Connery would go on to become the most famous James Bond and have an illustrious career, whilst Lazenby, who had previously worked in modelling, flopped as Bond only once. Before taking on the role, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Craig were all well-known performers in their own right. Page receiving the nod might be a bit of a stretch.
James Norton
Englishman For several years, James Norton has been towards the top of the betting odds. The 36-year-old appears to be appropriate and has a suitable profile. Norton made his mark as maniac Tommy Lee Royce in the critically praised  Happy Valley  in 2016, but it was his portrayal as Alex Godman in  McMafia  that cemented his place as the future James Bond.
With odds of 10/3 with Paddy Power, Norton appears to be the most incredible bargain among the market leaders.
Tom Hardy
Tom Hardy is the clear favourite for the role, with William Hill giving him a 5/2 chance of becoming the next James Bond. Hardy is known for films like Inception,  The Dark Knight   Rises , and  Mad Max , and has a total of 59 films under his belt. The  Venom  star is a hit with both men and women, and while many of his roles don’t exactly lend themselves to the suave, intelligent MI6 agent, we know he cleans up well and is a fantastic actor.
The 44-year-old actor starred as spy Ricky Tarr in  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  in 2011, but it was probably his part as Eames in Inception that revealed his potential as a Bond. Hardy is immensely popular with women, which you’d think would hold some weight with the producers; he even famously set hearts racing during a spell on CBeebies’ ‘Bedtime Stories’ (kind of a modern day Jackanory) I’m not sure if I’d put a bet on him at 5/2 odds. He’s six years older than Daniel Craig was when he first played the character in  Casino Royale  in 2011.
Lashana Lynch
Lashana Lynch is a newcomer to the next James Bond betting market. Could there be a female Bond? As fantastic as it sounds, it appears to be a reach, but her ascent in the betting markets has been fuelled by her appearance as ‘Nomi’ in the upcoming Bond flick No Time To Die.
The new film has been shrouded in secrecy, but Lynch stars alongside Craig as an MI6 agent, and the bookies have Lynch pegged at 6/1 to be the next Bond.
According to the creators, we won’t know when the next Bond is announced until 2022, so speculation will undoubtedly continue"
Now We’re Stuck With the Vomitous Beckham Spawn,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45627-now-were-stuck-with-the-vomitous-beckham-spawn.html,2022,"As if it wasn’t bad enough having the pea-brained yokel David Beckham poncing around the newspapers in his fucking y-fronts and ugly tattoos, as well as his money-losing permanently miserable looking wife who put it into her talentless head that she was some kind of fashion designer — now they’re parading their disgusting kids around in the media.
Turn the pages of any paper, or flick through any Internet site, and you get to see the dopey grin of Brooklyn Beckham, his vapid soulless eyes revealing he is truly a product of the Beckhams. You casually vomit large chunks of semi-digested food onto your breakfast plate.
What do these vermin do apart from pay vast amounts of cash to high-end PR companies to feature their plastic mediocrity over the media pages? They have no skills, no talent, no profession, mediocre looks and no intelligence. They have nothing to give to this world. The only reason they are in the position they are, is money and supposed celebrity status. Is this the measure of celebrity or fame there is today, to be simply pushed out of your celebrity mother’s straining overused vagina, or unceremoniously cut out by some grinning surgeon in a c-section? So, Brooklyn married some Instagram fickle plasticine brain-dead chav princess with a rich fucking daddy. Who fucking cares?
Why not put all these feckless celebrity kids into a spaceship and send it into space? It’s all the rage now, and it would be easy to persuade them to embark on their one way trip into the eternal darkness.
Alternatively, the Beckham progeny are an indication that humanity is truly fucked. There is no hope, they are precursors to all out nuclear destruction and annihilation of all life on earth.
We already have a virus called Covid-19, well add on another virus that exudes a limp monochromatic morose destitution and lack of any form of intelligence to the mix — Brooklyn Beckham, a slimy quivering tapeworm clasped to the arse sphincter of inhumanity.
Rid us of this vile pestilence, deliver us from this banal mediocrity, save us from this senseless torture of seeing your grimy working-class genes displayed in all their ugly glory, festooned upon posters, books, newspapers, every media orifice spammed to man.
We end on a happy note. Most celebrity kids end up as drug addicts. It is a certainty that Brooklyn is knee-deep in the white stuff, sozzling his single brain cell daily. He will get loads of tattoos, maybe some over his face, hopefully. Eventually the white stuff may not be enough, so he may move onto other things like the brown stuff, or crack. We can only hope, eh, that and driving his lambo into a pile of concrete bollards at 250MPH. Kaboom!"
LA Rapper Manages to Survive For More Than 6 Months,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47640-la-rapper-manages-to-survive-for-more-than-6-months.html,2022,"An Inglewood rapper has miraculously managed to survive for 6 months more than the usual life expectancy of rappers, according to reports.
KTITZ-TV, Channel 13 identified the rapper as Half Inch, who has released an album in May called “Bitch Bangin'”
The Los Angeles County Mayor’s office on Tuesday confirmed that a special medal of survival will be given to Wakandaishquan Jefferson, Half Inch’s real name.
Half Inch, 36, is one of the few rappers who has not been shot and killed in Los Angeles County in less than a month. On Sept. 11, rapper Fuque U, whose real name was Kuntekentay Mandingo Johnsons III Esq., was fatally shot during a botched robbery for the 30-year-old’s jewellery while he was having lunch at Roscoe’s House of Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles.
On Sept. 14, Little Dee Smalls, 23, whose real name was Barackz Trayvon Richardson, was shot and killed in Compton along with 29-year-old Julius Four Ounce Yeyo Jr.
The shooting tally on rappers for September in LA County was down this year with only 89 rappers shot. Statistics from September 2021 show over 145 rappers were shot and killed in LA alone.
The LAPD revealed that the life expectancy for an African American who declares themselves a rapper or even dares to release an album is less than 6 months. This is why the rapper Half Inch is now going to receive a medal to commemorate his incredible milestone of surviving for more than 6 months."

“Hey man, gimme a break man. Tee, hee, hee! (sniffs nose hard) They’ll have to scrape me off the ceiling of the Westminster Abbey and shit. I’ll be high as a kite man, just floating in wonderland as they crown pops. Hell, I may even wave down on the folks down there as they point up and look at me floating in the breeze man. Fuckin’ A, some tabs here, some lines there, some bong hits and maybe a cup or two of ayahuasca…chill out man, party on dudes, it’s gonna be a freaky moment in acid heaven, I may even meet Jesus right there in the church and shiet!”
During his days at Mahiki, Harry would compete with his toff friends on how many expensive cocktails they could snort up their noses through a straw on the taxpayers dime. Along with the heavy use of Class A drugs, sometimes going back to school on a Sunday night was a hard burn, especially if the dealer was not taken care of adequately.
“It’s all about therapy man, it makes me feel better because I am so drugged up I don’t even know where I am or what my name is. I get all schizo, and paranoid there are paparazzi hiding everywhere including the ashtray man…shit! When I was in those Apaches over Afghanistan, I sometimes thought I had angels wings ‘n’ shiet! Blasting away those Mujs and towel heads like they were fairground coconuts. Beautiful times! Especially while on drugs and untouchable. I can get away with anything I do.”"
Meghan Markle Sees Taking Down the Monarchy as a Challenge,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49072-meghan-markle-sees-taking-down-the-monarchy-as-a-challenge.html,2023,"Narcissists don’t always target weak and vulnerable people, they also sometimes target the strong-willed and talented. This is because they see it as a challenge, and they will find more entertainment in taking down someone impressive. For Meghan Markle, stringing an idiot like Harry along is not much of a challenge, and that’s why she is now eyeing up taking down the entire British monarchy.
How about that for a claim to fame, destroying the reputation of an institution that has survived for over 1,500 years? Markle is not challenged by subverting Harry against his own family anymore. In fact, it was all too easy for her, and like a puppy, Harry follows every directive she barks without any thought, simply because he is not armed to deal with such a conniving manipulative entity like Meghan, who has shoehorned herself into the role of his long deceased mother.
Narcissists have no feelings for their victims, and much like psychopaths have no conscience regarding their actions. The fake Meghan Markle smiles, and virtue signalling hypocrisy go hand in hand with someone who can smell weakness from miles away, or smell money making opportunities from even farther.
King Charles much like his lost son, Harry, reeks of weakness, as he is a supposed gentle soul who at times talks to his plants, and likes nothing better than to sit in front of the fire in Highgrove and read his books. Markle, who is inherently a vindictive schizoid narcissist who thinks she has been upstaged by the Brits, who saw through her facade, wants to destroy the royal family, so she can add that to her tally. She has already destroyed her own family, destroyed her own father, and destroyed countless men she used to gain more power.
We can only hope that Charles regains some composure and strengthens his hand dealing with this terminator and master manipulator who is using his own son against his family. The cold calculating machine that is Markle will not stop until her mission is accomplished, she will keep coming in for the attack incessantly and without any form of remorse. She will utilise the media she supposedly detests so much for her own ends.
Ultimately, for Markle, her destructive behaviour is about control. Furthermore, she views the royal family as a valid target because whatever happens, they seem to stick together as a family. This show of unity enrages her, especially as she never had that family feeling whilst growing up. Markle does not care one iota about the plight of black people and racism, especially as she is deemed as white herself, however she has found the royal family’s weakness and uses the ‘race card’ at every opportunity. By using the battering ram of ‘racism’ she can garner support from the far left Americans and black community who will fall behind her, as she plays them like pawns on a chess board. The castle walls and gates are being besieged by this entity, who will not stop until she is stopped."

Much Ado About Nothing: Meghan & Harry Netflix Whingeing Extravaganza,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48632-much-ado-about-nothing-meghan-harry-netflix-whingeing-extravaganza.html,2022,"While a horrid war is going on in Ukraine with millions of people suffering horrendous hardship and death, while people across Britain are suffering in fuel poverty, food poverty and job insecurity, here are these fuckers, Meghan and Harry moaning about their jet set life, their Montecito mansion, their privileged lifestyle where they are wallowing in more money and advantage than 99.99% of the population will ever know in their lives. This sickening vomitus couple are vile self-pitying morose creatures who are basically monetising past power plays and so-called ‘injustices’ that are in the scheme of things fucking trivial.
Netflix claims in the series that members of the royal family were approached for comment, but the royal palace has disputed that any member of the royal family was ever approached by the exploitative show. Therefore, the Netflix Meghan and Harry series starts off with a blatant lie, as it peddles its inane trivial self-pitying cowardly moan-fest.
The royal family have thus been cursed and will rue the day they ever allowed this nefarious viper into the fold. Meghan Markle, a despicable suppurating woke anal wart stalking the royal family with vicious lies, is clearly out to completely destroy their reputation and has even labelled the entire British population as racist.
This is about ego, narcissism and exploiting the memory of Princess Diana for money. Harry should hold his head in abject shame for besmirching the memory of his own mother by monetising her death via a tabloid exploitative reality show like Netflix. Scraping an already empty barrel for money, as the sycophantic leeches and parasites all nod their heads with every mundane narcissistic utterance from this vile grifting couple.
Sell your children for views, sell your dead mother for views, and sell your first world trivial grievances to people who are trying to survive in the real fucking world. Meghan and Harry are lower now than any Kardashian.
If you have a subscription to Netflix and have any dignity and pride, you should cancel it immediately, and if you don’t, you are worse than the scum who commissioned this shit, and the despicable nauseating narcissistic egotistical turds that star in it."
Kanye West Would Not Exist if Hitler Won WW2,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48573-kanye-west-would-not-exist-if-hitler-won-ww2.html,2022,"“Kanye West is a very confused, mentally deficient, disturbed individual who may idolise Adolf Hitler and the Nazis due partly to his hatred of Jewish people, but his own ignorance about history is also a factor to look at. The fact is, if Hitler and the Axis won in WW2, the eugenics programs would have sterilised all non-Aryan races across the globe. Kanye West would thus not exist because his ancestors would have either been gassed or sterilised. The negroid race was deemed as inferior and animalistic by the Nazis,” an Auschwitz survivor commented recently.
Ideally, Hitler’s beloved National Socialist Party would have expanded the concentration camp death system globally if the Nazis had won the war against the Allies. Eugenics and mass sterilisation programs are expensive and time intensive endeavours, especially when rolled out globally. The Nazis would probably have opted for a faster more efficient manner of cleansing via the expansion of the death camp system to quickly dispatch billions of so-called Untermenschen (sub-human races). Who is to say, from the 1950s onwards, the Germans would not develop far more efficient mass killing methods than the crude Zyklon-B gas chambers?
All other non-Aryan races are seen by fascist Nazis as genetic pollutants to be eradicated with extreme prejudice. Out of all races, the Nazis had scales, and the race that Kanye West belongs to is the bottom of the rung. Hitler’s Nazis feared the purity of the Aryan race being infected by the “throwback” African gene more so than of even Jewish blood. One can thus imagine death camps working day and night in the African continent for decades after the war until Hitler’s dream could be realised. Dr Mengele would be having a wonderful time as usual.
Ignorant, uneducated rappers with poor vocabulary and knowledge are still given a voice to spread their stupid ignorant thoughts. Why is that?
Well, the answer is quite simple really, West’s handlers, Jewish or not, have washed their hands of him and are now allowing him free rein to dig his own grave with his schizoid psychosis. If Kanye West had any dignity or intelligence, he would not be in the situation he is in now.
If Hitler had won the war, he would have neutralised Kanye West’s negroid ancestors and he would not exist today. How do you like your idol now Kanye?"
“I Really Enjoyed the Notting Hill Carnival Despite Being Stabbed Eight Times”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52789-i-really-enjoyed-the-notting-hill-carnival-despite-being-stabbed-eight-times.html,2023,"Local resident of Notting Hill, John Smith, 32, a Labour counsellor, recounted his experience at this year’s Notting Hill Carnival after being stabbed eight times and left for dead.
“As a champagne socialist and bleeding heart liberal slash Marxist, I actually enjoyed being stabbed multiple times. I usually virtue-signal at any opportunity, and this was a good time to champion the thug who plunged the zombie knife deep into my intestines and liver. I was revelling in the meaningful ‘inclusive’ cultural exchange as copious amounts of my blood spurted out of the stab wounds.”
Mr. Smith added that he was totally in tune with the poverty and debasement of the Jamaican born individual who butchered him.
“It’s not their fault, many cannot even read or write. I totally blame the Tory education systems because they do not take these people by the hand and give them things for doing nothing, they expect pupils to actually make an effort. At one point, my liver was hanging out of the stab wound, so I calmly pushed it back in so that no one would trip on it. After the stabbing stopped, I thanked the man for coming to our country and integrating into British culture. He then stabbed me in the groin for good measure. I thanked him for that as well.”
Mr. Smith is lucky to be alive, and will never walk again. His wounds were so severe that he will have to use a catheter to urinate for the rest of his life because his genitals were severed from his body. Despite this set back, Mr. Smith praised his attacker.
“If we were living in a  socialist Labour utopia  where money somehow grows on trees, and everyone is magically equal and happy, this young man would not be so angry. I really see his point because people tell him he has to work for a living and study for a good education, but because he can’t be bothered to work or study and is into drug dealing and part of a gang of murderous thugs he only knows violence as a way of communication. I have petitioned the council to give him more benefits, so he can buy more drugs and continue just being who he is. It’s not his fault, *cough* it….is….eurgh!”
At that point, unfortunately, Mr. Smith suffered from multiple organ failure and died gurgling about how great socialism and wokism is for society.

Is Frogmore the New Coventry?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49567-is-frogmore-the-new-coventry.html,2023,"It used to mean something if you were sent to Coventry, but as times change, now being sent to Frogmore is the new phrase used by people across the Kingdom.
With five rooms in this tiny cottage and a sitting room where you cannot even swing a crown, Frogmore Estate, a former servants quarters, is the place where Harry and Meghan were put into after Meghan Markle demanded to the late Queen that she and Harry should live at Windsor Castle. Instead, the ungrateful, deluded couple were put up in Frogmore. According to the news, Charles has chucked the couple out of Frogmore after the recent Netflix/book fiasco. The King has asked the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to move out of Frogmore Cottage for good to allow disgraced Prince Andrew to move in. This means the woke couple will have nowhere to stay if they ever venture back to the UK.
Prince Andrew is being demoted from a vast 35 room grand mansion with Brobdingnagian grounds and a long winding driveway — to a little cottage with five rooms close to the noisy main road. The humiliating climb down for Andrew must be sending suicidal thoughts through his frazzled,  Epsteined  single brain cell.
Being sent to Frogmore is thus the new Coventry. But, what happens when you’ve even been ousted from Frogmore like the Sussexes?
Frogmore/Coventry is now the last stop before the glue factory…and once banished from there — it’s the Phantom Zone for you or alternatively the Slough Travelodge."

Doctors Fears For Madonna in World Tour Fiasco,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49112-doctors-fears-for-madonna-in-world-tour-fiasco.html,2023,"Doctors have warned that due to the immense amount of Botox and plastic surgery on Madonna’s face, she may melt under the powerful lights during her concerts.
“Most of Madonna’s face could effectively melt and fall on the stage floor. The heat generated from concert lights can be very high, and her plastic surgery Botox face stretching staples could snap off. We urge her staff to conduct a safety consultation with each venue, so her face does not fall off during the concerts,” Dr Hamish McManus told the BBC.
Another physician was concerned with Madonna’s arms, which have very prominent veins showing.
“Her condition could be an amalgamation of many variables, for example steroid use, drugs, vitamin injections, along with weight lifting. We know that Madonna is a vitamin injector and has four or five vitamin injections per day. Along with her face melting and dripping onto the floor, her breast implants could explode, and the veins in her arms could burst spraying blood all over the place, especially if from the pressure one of the main arteries explodes,” Professor Ernest Finklestein, from Scunthorpe University Hospital revealed.
The doctors advise that Madonna and her management team ask for venues to turn down the lighting systems to a minimum to safeguard her health.
“The concerts should be conducted in complete darkness, or a very little amount of light. Her music is so awful, maybe they should also turn off all the amplifiers as well,” another doctor commented.
One fan wrote on Instagram: “I don’t care about what the stoopid docs say! Hell, what a souvenir if her face fell off into the crowd! I booked my ticket already!”
Madonna, who has one of the most used vaginas in the business, is said to have signed up to have it donated to science after her death."

Turdy the Magnificent Piece of Shit has nearly 900,000 follows on Instagram, with fans obsessing over the unparalleled piece of excrement.
But it’s far from its toilet years, according to Turdy’s account owner.
The six-year-old turd from Burnley, England, has become an internet sensation after its owner started sharing pictures and videos of it online.
Turdy the Magnificent Piece of Shit has nearly 900,000 follows on Instagram. Fans have become obsessed with its fluffy, squishy consistency of shit.
“Nothing makes this piece of shit more confident than being photographed for Instagram,” said the Twitter account WeRateShits, awarding Turdy a 13 out of 10 score.
Turdy’s owner, Nigel, said: “Turdy has more personality and is more mature than most people on Instagram.”
“I don’t know why it’s so popular, maybe because the fake plastic shallow soulless world of Instagram and social networks is so banal and awful that a piece of shit can receive so many followers.”
Turdy’s most popular post has almost 600,000 likes and hundreds of comments praising its unique look.
‘I saw a video of it sitting there for 9 hours. During the seventh hour, a blue bottle fly, lovingly called  Calliphora vomitoria , landed on it. I actually screamed out aloud in excitement,’ said one fan.
Another video shows Turdy displayed on a bean bag as the Instagram likes can be seen on a screen coming in their thousands in real time.
One fan even commented, “I would forfeit all my assets to that piece of shit,” while another called the turd a ‘distinguished gentle shit of our times’."
Gary Glitter to Advise Prince Andrew on Restoring Reputation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49310-gary-glitter-to-advise-prince-andrew-on-restoring-reputation.html,2023,"Disgraced nonce former pop star Gary Glitter has been freed from prison after serving half his 16-year jail sentence.
Glitter, 78, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was sentenced in 2015 for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13.
Upon release from HMP The Verne – a low security category C jail in Portland, Dorset, Glitter announced that he would like to not only restore his reputation as a serial paedophile but help the much beleaguered Prince Andrew restore his reputation as well.
“I’ve heard Prince Andrew wants to restore his reputation. Well, so do I. I am willing to work with Andrew right away. I just need to go on an urgent trip to Cambodia first.”
When the BBC reporter asked Glitter why he was going to Cambodia just after his eight-year prison term, Glitter just winked and left in a hurry to pack his bags.
There was no reply from Prince Andrew’s residence when reporters asked for comment."
Expat in Germany Won’t Give Up On British Humour and Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45956-expat-in-germany-wont-give-up-on-british-humour-and-satire-like-the-squib.html,2022,"It can be hard for expats to leave friends and family behind in the UK. According to some expats, there are a few British traditions that can’t be beaten.
Bobby Farthouse, 34, moved to Germany six months ago after being offered a job in a company.
However, he wrote in the  Telegraph  that there are few British traditions he’s found hard to give up.
He said he sometimes struggles with the challenge of moving to a new country because of the many differences in culture.
Bobby said: “It’s hard to smile or laugh here. If you tell a joke, all you get is…silence.”
For Bobby, British comedy and satire is one thing it’s been tough to leave behind. He said: “Sometimes, you really want a laugh, or even a smile. Most Germans do not have a sense of humour, this is why I desperately crave maybe a bit of dark British satire or humour to make me feel better.”
He said that he’d imagined absolutely “zero humour” in Germany before he decided to move, and he was right.
However, sometimes all an expat wants is a simple laugh, and what’s better than a dose of insane dark satire from the  Daily Squib ?
Although he said some expats might judge Britons for moving abroad to ingest British comedy, it can be hard to give up, especially where the country that you move to has very little sense of humour.
He said: “But the heart, and the funny bone, wants what it wants, even if that sometimes means eschewing a humourless German for British comedy and satire.”
When an expat relocates, it can be a challenge to find familiar things to help them relax. Trying to make some Germans laugh can be associated with trying to get blood from a stone.
According to SHIXA Healthcare, loss of humour can be a major source of culture shock for British expats when they first move.
To bridge the gap, many expats log on to the internet where they can access the  Squib  at  www.dailysquib.co.uk .
The online website delivers British humour, satire and quirky news around the world to keep any expats from feeling too homesick.
An afternoon surfing the Squib includes dumb ass humorous stories like  10 Ways to Survive the Cost of Living Crisis ,  Confused Transgender Keeps Changing Gender Every Six Weeks ,  Merkel to Have Sense of Humour Injected Into Her Brain  and  DAS BOOT : Von Der Leyen Considering Sending EU-boats Against Global Imports to UK .
There’s also  Meghan Markle’s piss ,  Hunter Biden’s crack  and plenty of  Remainer tears  for any expats desperate for a classic bit of British comedic relief.
Classic savoury satire options include  EU political satire ,  farts ,  drugs  and  religion .
A favourite British treat,  Britain’s Got Talent  is one of the site’s most viewed items with many expats.
Bobby said that he’d also struggled with German customs, including a struggle to not raise his straightened right hand as a form of greeting and clicking his heels every time he met a German.
Expats in Germany will have to get used to filling out a lot of paperwork, whether it’s to open a bank account or pay a utility bill. Getting a sense of humour is illegal in some cities and needs a special permit after a gruelling vetting process.
British expats definitely need to adapt to new friendships and a different style of living when they relocate."
You Have Reached the End of Netflix,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45658-you-have-reached-the-end-of-netflix.html,2022,"After having watched everything worth watching on Netflix, there is nothing left. All you are left to watch are the flaccid woke shows and D-rated films that never made the mark. Of course, Netflix does the thing where they take out a film for a while from the list, then re-introduce it after three or four months again into the list. Then they have the gall to suggest you watch that same film, as if you have not seen it over a million times already.
With great content like the upcoming Meghan Markle and Harry woke ‘extravaganza’ to look forward to, no wonder everyone’s switching off. Many would rather gouge their eyeballs out with a rusty spoon than watch those two preaching their woke mantra of bullshit for the eye-watering sums that Netflix paid them. Your money, your hard-earned cash subscription was put up to those two  grifters  and that’s what is even more sickening. Fucking  cancel the subscription  to Netflix once, twice, and thrice over.
What happens once you cancel?
It’s quite simple, really. There will be the odd show that you may want to watch. If you know the right places to find these, you can simply do so without any poxy subscription to a dying platform.
What happened?
When Netflix first came on to the scene it was fresh, innovative and hungry. Now it is a woke insipid wet fart with no innovation, or it seems, hope.
No, I do no not want to play some shitty app game. Can you believe it, now there is a column within the list where you can play some crap game app? You mean like the multiple million crap games you find on the Google Android store or all over the fucking net?
It seems Wokism kills everything, and it is killing Netflix very fast. The prognosis is not good. What seemed to be the answer to Hollywood has in fact become something it tried not to replicate. Now in pure desperation, Netflix is turning to adverts. If that is not another reason to dump your subscription, what is?
The guys who went down with the Blockbuster ship must be giggling into their dole cheques."

It is quite demanding because recording vocals in a decent way with the right compression, levels and all the other blah, blah stuff is rather tiresome, but it is a new direction for the Squib, therefore ahead we plough on.
In the latest episode a certain movie is referenced. Wonder if you can guess which one it is? In fact, the B-film was so bad that it was actually brilliant.
There is also a completely improvised insanely noisy guitar solo in there somewhere, as well as a few philosophical words to bring an element of thought in to the otherwise silly bits.

We had  The Hulk ,  She-Hulk: Attorney at Law , now the creators of this terrible mess have come up with  Trans-Hulk: High School Janitor .
The new Marvel character is a janitor at a Los Angeles High School where ‘they’ conducts ‘their’ daily duties like changing light bulbs and mopping floors.
“I am thrilled by this news about Trans-Hulk. Thank you, Marvel, for being so inclusive. I actually watched the pilot episode where Trans-Hulk pushes an entire wet mop up the ass of a transphobic High School senior taunting ‘them’ while ‘they’ were mopping the gym floor,” Marvel super fan, Arty Quint, 18, from Los Angeles, revealed at a recent Comic Con meeting.
Producer, Janine Butcher, revealed to  Hollywood Week  that the series will bring trans issues to more children, and that is her ultimate goal.
“I used to be a man myself, but now I am a full woman. I had my male genitals completely removed so that I could be a woman. If anyone says I ain’t a woman I will beat the living shit outta you. Raaaaaawr! We want more naive, innocent kiddies to mutilate their bodies after being persuaded by people like me.”
Trans-Hulk: High School Janitor  will hold its world premiere at El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on December 15, 2022. The series will debut on Disney+ on December 18, 2022, and will consist of nine episodes, concluding on February 13 2023."

“I is gon invades da Poland ‘n’ shiet, namsayin? All y’all jooz betta get reddy fo’ ma muffugin invasions ‘n’ shiet! Where iz dat place?” (pointing at Australia on a map)
According to reports West then called his bank and asked for a loan to buy tanks, artillery, Stuka aircraft, and lots of pepperoni pizza.

EXCLUSIVE: We Reveal the Identity of Family Mediator Harry Called,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47427-exclusive-we-reveal-the-identity-of-family-mediator-harry-called.html,2022,"Prince Harry suggested bringing in a mediator to solve his rift with the rest of the Royal Family, causing Camilla to ‘splutter over her tea’, a royal source has claimed.
“The meeting with Charles and Camilla was extremely awkward causing disbelief and bemusement,” the source revealed, adding that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were late to the meeting which left Charles with just 15 minutes to catch up with his youngest son and daughter-in-law before he had to attend the Royal Maundy Service at Windsor Castle where he stood in for the Queen.
The family friend said: “[Harry] actually suggested that they use a mediator to try and sort things out, which had Charles somewhat bemused and Camilla spluttering into her tea.”
They added the Queen Consort told the Duke his suggestion was ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and that they would resolve their differences within the family.
So, who was going to be the mediator that Harry would bring along to the royal family?
The source added that the person was a very well-known celebrity in the United States, and great friends of the Sussexes.
After revealing the name of the mediator, it is a certainty that Camilla and Charles, including the rest of the royal family, would collectively splutter into their tea in absolute disbelief.
Et voila…the mediator, Oprah Winfrey."
Meghan Markle Cuts Ties With Royal Family Completely But Will Still Use Titles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51426-meghan-markle-cuts-ties-with-royal-family-completely-but-will-still-use-titles.html,2023,"According to the office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex/Montecito, Meghan Markle will not be attending the coronation of King Charles III in a major snub to the royal family. Instead, she has sent Prince Harry as envoy to attend the coronation alone.
Royal commentators have come to the conclusion that this refusal to attend the coronation is the final nail in the coffin for Markle’s short jaunt with the royal family, as she has effectively cut the cord completely.
“It is doubtful that Markle will ever come to Britain again, and is now completely estranged from the British royal family. It may be a show of defiance by her, however in all reality she will continue to use the Duchess title to make money in America and continue to profit off her marriage to Prince Harry. In all instances, one could say she has the best of both worlds and will continue to coin it making millions off the royals whilst effectively rejecting them in reality,” a commentator revealed on Wednesday.
If King Charles had any guts he would have demoted these two freeloaders of any royal title a long time ago, however Charles has been extremely diplomatic considering the amount of vitriol and vindictive hatred directed to the Windsor clan by Harry and Meghan. The added disgusting usage of the royal titles to make millions of dollars is another insult, not only to the royal family, but the British people as a whole. Has Meghan ever been to Sussex? She probably could not even point to it on a map. It is a total insult to the people of Sussex to be represented by someone who detests the British people and royal family with such vehemence.
If there is any justice in this world, Harry and Meghan should be demoted to the nobodies they truly are, and should not be allowed to profit off their supposed ties to the British royal family or Britain. We have heard of taxation without representation, well, this is royalty without representation, and it makes a mockery of the British royal institution and people.
Hopefully, one day the American people fawning over this acrid stench of hypocrisy and exploitation will see through the shallow narcissistic facade of Meghan and Harry, two  grifters  skimming millions off ruthless and blind media executives who have no morals or a shred of dignity as they only see dollar signs as they market these two miscreants to gullible American audiences who do not understand royalty or know what it really is in any capacity or form."

Yes, I had just come from my chalet after a serious session of drinkage, plus I just had my delicate  brussels sprout  steamed, you know what I mean? Well, suddenly out of the blue, bammo! I found myself in a position of compromise — I had unconsciously coupled with an elderly gentleman who frankly should not have been there. This old fart should have been firmly ensconced in front of a TV set in some dingy old people’s home drinking soup, not, I dare say, with a pair of skis on a snowy mountain. Tony Stark was nowhere to be seen as I called out wildly. Nevertheless, after unconsciously coupling with the man at high speed, I consciously uncoupled with the old gent and went on my way. Listen, I’ve got people to see, gloop to cook and expensive garbage to sell on my website, I cannot be seen to be coupling with dirty old men? I thus offer the elderly gent one dollar, and nothing more,” Gwyneth Poultry, Hollywood actress and internet entrepreneur revealed to the court.

Now They’re Coming After Russell Brand As Well,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52894-now-theyre-coming-after-russell-brand-as-well.html,2023,"The Daily Squib has been attacked by certain nefarious EU companies since the Referendum and Brexit trying to take us down, and now poor old Russell Brand is being attacked for his playful days while he was digging for gold in between the legs of many, many women. According to his YouTube channel, Brand is now being accused of certain allegations regarding the multiples of women he slept with in the past.
These are the vagaries and dangers of having an opinion other than is allowed in the Mainstream Media in a Western civilisation which is seriously moving towards a more authoritarian sovietised stance led by the Chinese communist model of censorship and totalitarian media control. With ESG and the  WEF , and EU dictating censorship rules, the West is daily declining and moving away from democracy and free speech.
The voices speaking the truth are viewed as dangerous by the soviet censors who are now in charge and have infiltrated all media and politics. This is why publications like the Daily Squib are now in danger; where satire was once a protected literary genre in the past, we are now in danger of being shut down and our voice forever silenced. The same goes for Russell Brand, a man who certainly shoots from the hip, who dares to uncover the truth from many corrupt facets of society, business and politics. Admittedly, some of his titles on his YouTube and Rumble videos are obvious clickbait, and pander to the ‘conspiracy theory’ movement, but where there is smoke, there is invariably fire.
We joked about Russell Brand in the past, thinking he was some kind of dilettante, but we now know he is the real deal. The problem with speaking the truth and uncovering all sorts of nastiness going on under the noses of the masses is that you have to have a damn squeaky clean reputation to do this. If there are any doubts, events in the past or morally unacceptable things in one’s character, your enemies will zero in on these and destroy your reputation. It happens all the time with politicians vying for election. Being a public figure is a dangerous endeavour, more so these days than in the past. The amount of data being analysed and filtered through the machine of moral outrage is increasing daily.
As the Daily Squib is constrained and limited in what it can write these days, we cannot express our satirical dark humour as we wish anymore. Russell Brand is a character who has tried to seek the truth, and we commend him for that, however in doing so, he put himself into the crosshairs of the woke #metoo soviet snipers who are now out for blood. Maybe, Brand quotes praising the Metoo movement in the past were part of his liberal sensibility to endorse such witch-hunts, it is also rather ironic that his downfall may be precipitated by the weaponised usage of the Feminazi group against him.
We can only wish Russell luck in fighting the vultures and parasites now chomping down and feeding off his wildly spinning chakras, sucking the very life force from his soul.
Western civilisation is fast being subverted and corrupted by the hyper-sensitive puritanical forces of evil communist censors, and from here life will be a dark, dystopian, Orwellian nightmare that you will try to wake up from but will be imprisoned within the echo chamber of political correctness created by the jailers who now control everything.
Why Independent Thought is Feared by Woke Programmers
Daily Squib Knew Chinese Communist Party Exporting Internet Censorship Globally in 2018"
Woke Producer Who Single-handedly Destroyed the Star Wars Franchise Strikes Again,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51787-woke-producer-who-single-handedly-destroyed-the-star-wars-franchise-strikes-again.html,2023,"You may or may not have heard of Kathleen Kennedy, the Disney/Lucasfilm film producer who single-handedly destroyed the Star Wars franchise, but in a turn of events that will have many puking into their popcorn bags, she is back again to ‘wokify’ the Indiana Jones franchise. No wonder Spielberg walked away from this one.
This time, Luke Skywalker is not depicted milking green milk out of some alien’s teats for his morning cereal, but poor old ageing Harrison Ford has to deal with his feminist woke god-daughter played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
In a stunning display of creative destruction, Kennedy has re-emerged on the scene once again much like an unwanted case of bubbling super Gonorrhoea, armed with the most powerful weapon of our time: woke soviet political correctness and a hyper-woke ideology. With an unwavering commitment to dismantling every cherished film franchise, this producer has become a force to be reckoned with, leaving no trope unscathed and no story untarnished. You want your cherished film franchise completely destroyed? Then bring in Kathleen Kennedy to decimate, eviscerate and kill off any semblance of joy film watchers had in past films.
Gone are the days when filmmakers simply entertained audiences with captivating narratives and timeless characters. This visionary producer has taken it upon herself to be the moral compass of the industry, ensuring that every film conforms to the rigid guidelines of social justice, hardcore feminism, inclusivity, and, of course, the ever-elusive “woke” political indoctrination factor.
Remember, Wokism is a nefarious soviet communist technique that  cannot create anything new , it can only ruin the past, and history.
No longer can we revel in the simple pleasures of escapism and suspend our disbelief. Kathleen Kennedy, like a self-appointed guardian of virtue, has made it her mission to infuse every frame with a heavy-handed political agenda. Forget about character development or engaging storytelling—what truly matters is the progressive sovietised virtue-signalling message of the day.
Want a classic film franchise revitalized? Well, think again. Prepare yourself for the unapologetic onslaught of contrived diversity, where characters are shoehorned in based on arbitrary identity quotas rather than actual narrative relevance. Who needs a coherent plot when you can have a checklist of social justice buzzwords?
But it doesn’t stop there. Oh no, Kennedy won’t rest until every cherished aspect of a film franchise is distorted beyond recognition. Time-honoured traditions and iconic elements are cast aside like yesterday’s rubbish, all in the name of appeasing the perpetually outraged Twitter mob. Because, let’s face it, the true measure of artistic success lies in the number of retweets and “likes” from the cunting woke brigade.
Say goodbye to fun and entertainment, folks. Prepare yourself for two hours of guilt-ridden self-reflection and lectures on privilege. Who needs escapism when you can have a relentless barrage of finger-wagging and sermonizing? Isn’t that what we all signed up for when we bought our film tickets?
So, let us raise a toast to this illustrious producer, who valiantly ruins every film franchise she touches in the name of progress and virtue signalling. Bravo! The destruction of beloved stories and the alienation of loyal fans have never been more en vogue.
In the end, we can only hope that sanity and creative freedom will prevail. But until then, buckle up, dear audience, for the ride of a lifetime. Just don’t expect it to be enjoyable, coherent, or remotely faithful to the source material. After all, who needs a successful film franchise when you can have a preachy, politically correct mess?"
Stasi Commissars Line Up For Soviet Censored Edinburgh Fringe Festival,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52698-stasi-commissars-line-up-for-soviet-censored-edinburgh-fringe-festival.html,2023,"Stasi commissars and Bolshevik troops were regaled at this year’s woke Marxist Edinburgh Fringe Festival of Soviet Non-Comedy. The  humourless  coterie of performers all abided by strict puritanical communist regulations that completely kill any form of comedy.
“Comrades, thank you for attending this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It is good to see you all wearing your Soviet caps and drab green uniforms. We have a wonderful set of performers this year who will all be performing the same things as each other with the same humourless non-comedy woke salad shite. If we see anyone laugh or look happy, they will be sent to a fucking gulag. Enjoy the show, comrades,” a  Stasi  official announced.
According to the regulations and diktats of the heavily censored event, any performer who dares to even think of having a mind of their own, or an opinion that is not in line with woke communist ideology will be cancelled, ejected from the show and sent to a gulag somewhere in Glasgow.
Comrade Nadine McManus, from Dunfermline, praised one of the woke communist performances.
“I enjoyed the show and everyone clapped on cue. The soviet dancing performance was wonderful. Afterwards we were treated to a few chapters of Lenin’s book  The State and Revolution.  I saw someone who was not clapping in time, so I reported them to the Commissar, who thankfully took action immediately and removed them. I cannot wait to come back next year.”
Another attendee from Islington, London was Comrade Marcus Stallin, who watched a performance of soviet school children playing guitars uniformly and with perfect timing.
“It was truly magnificent. The children played perfectly. I suppose the teacher standing behind them with a bull whip had something to do with it. Not bad for a bunch of four-year-olds.”"

Zuckerberg’s new Twitter clone is just another digital lobotomy for the putrid brainless masses to indulge themselves in, and this is a service served well by the Meta corporation creating these awful horrible digital prison atrocities daily.
One can only hope that Zuck’s Meta World or whatever it is called in the future will have all these fuckers locked into comatose states with these programs linked directly to their central neocortex. It will certainly be a quieter world as they are all in their darkened rooms enacting their dreams of social media stardom in states of utter silence and rigidity. This will be death before actual physical death, as they are entertained to become ineffectual human voids, useless pieces of meat in permanent vegetative states. They will most certainly be fed through tubes and their waste siphoned out of them, reconditioned, then probably fed back to them. Once their hearts stop pumping, they will be put into acid baths and liquified, and the nutrients fed back to the comatose idiots still linked to the system.
Musk’s Twitter is no different to Zuckerberg’s creepy censorship prisons. Heavy-handed censorship is still prevalent on the site, even after the previous regime was supposedly turfed out. Despite promising change, sites like the Daily Squib are still permanently shadowbanned on Twitter.
Your life is meaningless on Instagram as it is on any grotesque Zuckerberg mental prison. It is just that you are too fucking stupid, pathetic, narcissistic and shallow to realise it."

Bonkers Prince Harry Now Thinks He is an Egyptian Pharaoh,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52547-bonkers-prince-harry-now-thinks-he-is-an-egyptian-pharaoh.html,2023,"Bonkers Prince Harry thinks he is now an Egyptian Pharaoh and wants to be mummified in his own pyramid in Las Vegas alongside Meghan when he dies, his spokesperson Ovid Scooby has revealed to the BBC.
“Harry daily consults a reincarnated Egyptian priestess from Fresno called Amy Schmucker. She looked into her magical crystal ball and saw that Harry is actually the reincarnation of Amenhotep IV, who ruled Egypt during the period of the New Kingdom from 1351 to 1334 BC. He told me that the priestess said some funny words and immediately Harry was struck by this feeling that he really truly was a pharaoh and that he needed to make haste in his mission to build a pyramid as a final resting place, because pyramids take a long time to build and need many workers to push rocks around, or something like that. This means Harry is now more important than King Charles and all the British royal family combined.”
Initially, Harry consulted the Montecito city council on his plans to build a pyramid about 455 feet tall consisting of 2.3 million blocks of limestone. Each block would weigh around 2.5 tons (2267.96 kilograms). So 2,300,000 x 2267.96 = 5,216,308,000 kilograms (5,750,000 tons) of material would be required.
Unfortunately for Harry, Montecito town councillors told the ‘pharaoh’ that he cannot build a structure like that in the protected area, so now he has gone to Las Vegas where there is a pyramid already, and a possibility for another one to be built.
Meghan Markle was also told that she was the reincarnation of Queen Cleopatra, and immediately called Jadajada Pinky Smithers, who congratulated her on her new-found status as Queen of Africa.
“The couple daily invite many Californian psychics into their home, and Meghan Markle once invited a voodoo priestess from Haiti so that she can cast a horrid spell on Camilla. Yes, they are very open-minded progressive people, and should be applauded for their wonderful sense of energy,” Scooby added."
ANALYSIS: Was Prince Harry Making a Statement in Latest Address?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55590-analysis-was-prince-harry-making-a-statement-in-latest-address.html,2024,"Yes, Prince Harry was a gunner on an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan for 6 weeks, and he served his country briefly, but royal fans have been questioning his ‘ludicrous’ display of medals for his brief stint in the military in his latest video address.
“Arse!”
Royal fans were up in arms when they saw a blurred, wonky amateur video of the prince on his porch in Montecito wearing medals all over a cheap looking civilian suit.
One Twitter X user commented: “What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned”
Another X user revealed: “He looks like a prize ninny! Who’s he trying to fool?”
However, others defended the duke, with one user  Laquisha46  commenting: “Harry is wearing his medals proudly, which our African princess Meghan probably purchased for him in a flea market in Santa Monica. Leave them alone, you bunch of bullies. Love you Meghan.”
The consensus was of ridicule for the wayward prince who has admitted to heavy use of class-A drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, meth and marijuana, allegedly including when he served.
Expert analysis
Royal expert and body language expert Arbuthnot Bollsaque commented on the  BBC  that “Harry is showing defiance for being stripped of his right to wear a military uniform by displaying the plethora of medals all over his cheap looking suit”.
Harry was  stripped   of  his honorary military titles by late Queen Elizabeth II after he stepped down from royal life in 2020 and moved to California with Meghan Markle."
Meghan Markle Sends Pint of Milk to 50 Celebrities,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55550-meghan-markle-sends-pint-of-milk-to-50-celebrities.html,2024,"“I like to milk things. I milk and milk and milk until there’s nothing left. Then I milk more, just for those dry crusty teats to give up just a few drops more of milk,” Meghan Markle revealed to Hollywood Week magazine.
Markle’s interest in milking may also extend to British royal matters, which involves a lot of milking as well.
“If I hadn’t snatched and ensnared that certain dumbo royal prize, I could not have performed so much milking. Thank Lucifer for dumb people, eh. The sheer amount of milking and milking has been extortionate, and I should know because now I’m drinking the milk of my endeavours.  Netflix , Spotify, shopping blogs, branding my own kids, and of course the huge floppy milk filled bulbous teat of the American people. I’m milking the American public as if they were an overloaded heifer flopping around in a field of stupidity. They are so easy to milk because they all adore me so much. Silly fools!”
The lucky 50 celebrities who all received a pint of milk personally milked by Meghan Markle all showed their gratitude on social media.
One US celebrity wrote: “It sort of tastes like arse milk, or the curdled strainings of clotted yellow liquid after leaving a carton of bubbling, frothy milk on a piping hot radiator for four hours. The question is, how long can Meghan milk the royal cow for?”"

Congresswoman AOC, Lauren Underwood, Katherine Clark, Judy Chu, Jasmine Crockett, and Susie Lee are all highly trained in the art of Bull Shitto, a martial art that takes years of intense study.
No one is sure how the Donald will get out of this one. He might be at the golf course one day putting a birdie right in the hole when BAM a Democrat congresswoman Avenger appears out of the bushes. One in the sack, two in the jaw, and it’s lights out for the Don.
Good thing the Don has been brushing up on his own martial arts. It’s called the Russian art of Kung Pu-tin."
Meghan Markle: “Harry is Old News Now!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53976-meghan-markle-harry-is-old-news-now.html,2023,"Meghan Markle is dumping Prince Harry for the Big Time Hollywood A-List crowd, and now sees him as a burden to her aspirations.
“Harry’s been used up, and now he is not needed, as Meghan is getting what she used him for — the big A-List Hollywood crowd. That’s  what narcissists do , they find a target, use it up then move on to the next target — whichever benefits them the most,” a Hollywood insider revealed on Saturday.
Meghan is ecstatic at her Hollywood return and jumps with glee that all her plans worked out in the end.
“She is all smiles, but now Sparkle needs to dump the grump,” the insider added.
Indeed, Harry is somewhat a liability now and is viewed as a grumpy old fool who was easily tricked by this woman, an intelligent grifter with aspirations way above his vision. Markle’s new A-Lister friends are all urging her to dump the wayward prince because he is holding her back. From day one of meeting Harry, Meghan’s plans have worked out a treat, and she can’t wait for the  big pay day  after the divorce, especially as the California laws are so good to women. This is why she is keeping Harry in California, because of the massive pay day she will receive to look after the two children as well.
Reports from industry insiders already claim the Duchess of Sussex is eyeing a major TV comeback in an upcoming spin-off from her hit USA Network drama, Suits.
“I have never seen her so happy, she is loving the attention she is getting from her Hollywood friends and fans,” one of Meghan’s acquaintances revealed.
Meghan Markle appeared alone for her latest red carpet appearance, at the Power of Women gala in Los Angeles.
During the prestigious event, she rubbed shoulders with the likes of Margot Robbie and  Billie Eilish , but her husband was nowhere to be seen.
An agent at the event said: “Grumps is at home looking after the kids, while Meghan is flitting around with a smile so wide it looks like she has had a 15-inch metal ruler stuffed in her mouth, cheek to cheek.”
Here’s to Meghan’s A-List career and her moving on from old losers."

If women want to have orgasms, they should be allowed to do so without arrest. Shouldn’t the police in Georgia be pursuing real criminals instead of innocent women simply gratifying a natural human need? Women should be allowed to masturbate wherever they fucking well want to.
“Women having  orgasms  is a beautiful thing, and I wish more would do it in public. This world would be a better place if women showed off their orgasm powers more. I mean, it’s a beautiful thing when they get all flushed and start those little noises,” someone in favour of women masturbating in public revealed.
Christina Revels-Glick, who was 34 at the time, was approached by cops after families reported her salacious behaviour on Tybee Island beach on July 1, 2021.
Bodycam footage from the officers who arrested her was released this week, showing her breaking down as she was handcuffed and marched away from the sand.
Christina explained that she just slipped in her vibrator to have a quick orgasm because she felt like it.
As for the prudes who reported Christina for having a little fun, those people are the reason this world is in the sorry state it is.
We want to praise Christina Revels-Glick for her bravery in pursuing freedom to orgasm and if she is ever in London, England she can find sanctuary in our orgasmic offices where anything goes. Here’s to human freedom and the right for women to be allowed to masturbate in public."
District 9 Woke Games Entry Looked Superb This Year,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56954-district-9-woke-games-entry-looked-superb-this-year.html,2024,"Modelled on the last supper from a forgotten religion of some sort from the past, District 9 prepared a wonderful display for the 2024 Paris/Panem Woke Games for all to see.
Sodom and Gomorrah
Director of the show, Pumpy Mi Anoos, a 43-year-old thing of undetermined species revealed how the immense feat was achieved: “We used 11.5 billion euros taken from the District 9 taxpayer slave workers and recreated a last supper scene with a fat grotesque smelly drag queen Tribute Slob representing some sort of religious icon of the past. I cannot remember the name, but someone mentioned a superhuman Messiah from a man-made religion written by drunk monks hundreds of years ago or something. Never heard of him until now, but that’s neither here nor there. Our main aim of course is to push this abhorrent subject matter down the throats of the audience, hell, we even included children in the show to display our brainwashing prowess.”
Woke Torture for Viewers
The District 9 Woke Games of Paris/Panem was a wonderful display of some seriously grotesque and ugly curiosities, like a freak show that many viewers delighted in its sheer repugnant nature.
One viewer revealed his incredible reaction to seeing the numerous freaks, drag queens, transgenders, and blatant sodomy on display as being an affront to their eyeballs.
“The District 9 show made my eyes water, I could not believe I could witness such horrific displays of woke grotesqueness in one sitting. If I had a choice of shaving my eyeballs with a cheese grater or watching this utter shite, I would have chosen the former option with gusto. During the display of the creature with a beard in a dress prancing around a bridge to the strains of some awful gay pop music, I projectile vomited onto the televisual device I was watching this crap on, and thankfully my vomit short-circuited the device, ending the woke torture session in earnest.”
In stark contrast to the 99% of viewers who were repulsed by the blatant woke display, President Coriolanus Macron had only praise for the performance.
“My wife/husband, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Afterwards, I went back to my palace and was buggered silly by my bodyguards for 15 hours, much to my sheer delight. It was a wonderful end to the evening, although I cannot walk much now. Ooof!”"

A world where everyone dresses the same, and everyone is a picture of pure conformity amongst the mellisonant words of our feudal lords. This is our beloved woke dystopia of conformity.
There is no privacy in this world because cameras and surveillance systems monitor each person at all times. Your every action and thought is broadcast to the controllers who monitor your behaviour 24 hours of the day. Your data and metrics are logged, filed and analysed. Your habits and distant dreams known.
In this world, there are  no secrets  any more, as you are watched and controlled “for your own safety”.
The Woke Marxist feudal lords who rule over you are doing this for your own benefit; they really do care for you, they know best, they want you to be happy, to smile through your gritted teeth as you consume their daily effluvia within this mindless prison of utter dystopian conformity.
You must be happy, happy, happy at all times and if you are not, then it will be re-education for you or maybe a mild adjustment to your brain interface. If that does not work, then it will have to be permanent cancellation for you. What a pity! You did not conform, you did not capitulate like the others. You are an aberration, an anomaly, therefore it is the disintegration room for you. Your mise en abyme must be punished, you must be cleansed of all individuality and obliquity.
This is our dystopia of conformity, our Metaverse, our internet, our woke conformist society today and in the future."

“We emphatically deny that there was any form of Photoshop tampering with the royal photograph,” a palace spokesman revealed on Wednesday.
Well, that’s settled then, absolutely nothing to see here folks, the official statement from the palace has confirmed that there is no problem with the royal photograph.
One royal fan who saw the photo seemed a little confused.
“When I look at the photo, something seems a little strange, but I can’t quite put my finger on it, hmmm, kind of odd.”
Can anyone tell what is wrong with the photograph above? Leave your comments if you can see any Photoshop anomalies."
Formerly Funny Aussie Actress Loses Weight and Comedy Ability,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45205-formerly-funny-aussie-actress-loses-weight-and-comedy-ability.html,2022,"Yeah, we’re talking about Rebel Wilson, who in turning Woke and losing weight is now as funny as anal prolapse surgery conducted with a rusty blunt scalpel. Obviously Wilson, a celebrated Hollywood actress can afford the trainers; the nutritionists, the surgeons and the chef cooked macrobiotic or whatever diet she gets, but can she afford losing her entire humorous repertoire all in one go? Being ‘Woke’ is the antithesis of all creativity, comedy and acting, but Wilson still managed to crawl up the ass of ‘Wokism’ anyway.
The FAFTA Awards, an overflowing shitberg of woke virtue signalling celebrity luvvies all sniffing each other’s bottoms, is a nauseating celebration of mediocrity and champagne socialism all mixed into a bucket of anti-art, anti-creative soviet woke ideology that is more in tune with the former Soviet Union than anything within what once was a democratic free society. What these peddlers of pseudo-Marxist wokeness fart out in their diminutive arse kissing ceremony is an ode to banality and a peculiar brand of conformism that even NPCs in a computer game would baulk at.
Such is the demise of Hollywood and the British Film ‘Industry’ in recent decades that it now mirrors the current state of the Music Biz. Woke agenda after woke agenda is pushed by these despicable cunts. One supposes, if they pursued true artistry and creativity, Chinese communist money would stop funding their foul pusillanimous projects. You only have to take a look at the credits of any new release to see which Chinese company paid for the latest piece of humourless, talentless unartistic trash to be jettisoned from the frothing syphilis-ridden mouth of any given writer/producer/director ‘yes man’ to  Chinese money  and propaganda.
This is exactly why these actresses and actors can afford to go woke and tow the soviet party line, because they know that whatever they do, however despicable the picture they star in, Chairman Mao, or Xingping Pong will continue pumping millions of Chinese Yuan into their already overflowing bank accounts.
Rebel Wilson used to be funny when she had a little meat on her, now she’s just another CCP funded unfunny Hollywoodized product that has lost its mojo."
"Expert Shares Ways to Save Money on Netflix, Disney+, Amazon and Apple TV+",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55360-expert-shares-ways-to-save-money-on-netflix-disney-amazon-and-apple-tv.html,2024,"As  the warmer weather is almost here, and the constant rain hopefully subsides a little for a few months at least, you may have noticed that many household bills are increasing. Every year, providers up the prices of bills including TV, mobile phones and broadband inline with  inflation . However, there is a way to save money on these things, so please read on.
Added to that, several streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ have also updated their membership rates and, as many of us now subscribe to several streamers at once, this means we end up paying more each month to watch all the stuff on these streaming platforms. Netflix now costs £10.99 for its Standard plan or £17.99 for Premium and has clamped down on members sharing their accounts, with Disney+ confirmed to be following suit later this year.
Over at Amazon, Prime Video members must now fork out an extra £2.99 a month for an ad-free subscription. Luckily, there are loads of ways to cut down costs, and I’m going to show you how.
Switch off the fucking telly and do something else
This simple method of switching off your TV will keep more money in your pocket, and is known as ‘switchingoffing’. Here, we explain what this means, how it works and most importantly how much you can save.
What is switchingoffing?
Even with all the time in the world, we wouldn’t be able to watch the endless amount of shit and utter crap on streaming platforms. So rather than have subscriptions to these money-grabbing parasite streaming services – Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video and Apple TV+ – simultaneously, cancel all the fucking subscriptions and switch all the mind-numbing shite off.
Even before you take advantage of other ways to cut down costs, at its most basic this could save the average household hundreds of pounds a year on streaming costs that you and your family really do not need in any shape or form. Along with dumping all of the parasite paid streaming subscriptions, the most important thing to dump is the fucking  TV licence tax . Don’t worry, you can still watch free streaming services if you really must, but you will not be able to watch anything from the current state of the BBC, which is no loss at all.
Not only does this save money, but by the time you have ‘switchoffed’ all the paid services over the year you’ll find much more new activities to enjoy and get loads more value from doing other things with your life that are way more productive. Don’t forget to also limit your smartphone usage by buying a very basic package just for calls and a little surfing. This could save you literally thousands of pounds of money that would otherwise be wasted on utter shite.
Remember, by switching off all this unnecessary crap that is being pushed on you daily, you not only save some money, but you also preserve your frame of mind and are not polluted by substandard banal crap that literally rots away your mind. Read a fucking book instead. Enjoy your life, and don’t fill your mind up with useless junk and woke bullshit that hinders every part of your being."

What’s on this list, you may ask?
Well, it’s not rocket science or anything, it’s a list of people who fucked with the Don, people who put him in the crosshairs, people who weaponised the system against him, people who corrupted government departments for their own gain, and just plain assholes who made life difficult for the Don in the past.

Jack Smith  – a weaponised Justice Dept. asshole who is owed karma.
Letitia James  – another DEI going down.

Alvin L. Bragg  – an election interfering scumbag.
Fani T. Willis  – impeach this DEI with haste.

Gen. Mark A. Milley  – treason.
Michael D. Cohen  – a rat.
John Bolton  – the moustache itself justifies arrest, plus a snitch.
James Comey  – a corrupt FBI goon.
Andrew McCabe  – another corrupt FBI goon.
Peter Strzok  – Russian BS agent.
51 former top intelligence officials  — including former Obama officials John O. Brennan, James R. Clapper Jr. and Leon Panetta.
Mark Zuckerberg  – on the watch list, but he kissed the ring — so OK for now.
Sleazy Sleepy Creepy Joe Biden and his family  – too much to list here.
Barack Obama  – pillow biter Barry and Big Mike are in a world of trouble.
Vice President Kamala Harris  – woke salad Kameltoe.
“Crooked” Hillary Clinton  – no explanation needed.
Adam B. Schiff  – false impeachment asshole.
Nancy Pelosi  – with a face like that!
Harry and Meghan  – the  grief grifters  might be in trouble, especially with  drugs .
DEI  – Merit system will be back, no more BS.
Keir Starmer, Mandy, Lammy, Labour  – Sending 100 Labour activists to  undermine the Trump election  was not a good idea, neither was calling Trump a “ dangerous fascist “.
Sadiq Khan  – This  worm  has it coming to him so bad.
AOC  – No, she’s not going to the inauguration of a “ rapist “.

Blacks Empowered by Return of Meghan Markle to Spotlight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59348-blacks-empowered-by-return-of-meghan-markle-to-spotlight.html,2025,"If you go to Twitter X, all you now see are black people posting fawning posts about some silly Netflix show that Meghan Markle is doing. They feel empowered by having this woman showing up the Windsor royal family and destroying “whitey”. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, all it shows is that there is a great divide between black and white, even though Markle is more white than black herself.
Although Markle was forbidden from using the given royal title to profit off, she is making a fool of the royal family and weak King Charles, who does not have the guts or balls to take away her title after the amount of abuse she has dealt the Windsors by profiting hugely off the cursed thing. It is truly sad to see the amount of thievery that has gone on by Markle, and her entitled  give me that  nature, (even stealing the late Queen’s nickname  without her permission ) but it is what it is, and as the stolen fruits of the British royal family are defiled in some garish vulgar Netflix show, life goes on for many people without bothering about such banal shite. African Americans are loving it though, it is almost a fuck you to the British colonials, and a win against the “white oppressors” of old for them. Despite not being able to cook, it is obvious that all the dishes in the show were carefully prepared by a professional chef, and the sickeningly thin Meghan certainly does not eat food like that.
The Windsors are now a lost memory, a fading photograph riddled with cancerous tumours, as Meghan Markle laughs in their faces scoffing at their “stuffy” German faces.
All it would take is one swift stroke of the sword to correct things by revoking the Sussex title and the Windsors would reclaim their place, but alas this will never happen, and they will forever be lost in the sands of cowardice and timid surrender. Courage it seems is in very short supply in Britain at the moment."
Meghan Markle Could Sell Sussex Branded Landmines On Instagram,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61210-meghan-markle-could-sell-sussex-branded-landmines-on-instagram.html,2025,"Meghan Markle loves money so much, she is now considering selling Sussex branded landmines on her Instagram affiliate marketing shop. The landmines would be dropshipped and delivered to any war zone, DMZ or territory with next day shipping available, giving her a nice tidy commission.
It’s the dollars, any way to make cash money is okay, and Markle is no exception to this rule.
It is not certain which type of Sussex branded landmines Meghan will go for, but it will probably be the type that blows people up.
Mine expert Hugo Boom is an ex-Pentagon arms salesman and suggests the celebrity influencer sells mines like the M18A1 Claymore fragmentation mine in bulk, maybe 100,000 units minimum, which in commission sales could be top-notch.
Bulk orders from places like Myanmar or Hamas would make for some serious cash.
“The M18 is a beautiful piece of ordnance. When detonated, the explosion drives the matrix forward, out of the mine at a velocity of 3,937 ft/s, at the same time breaking it into individual fragments. The steel balls are projected in a 60 degree fan-shaped pattern that is 6.6 ft high and 55 yd wide at a range of 55 yd. The force of the explosion deforms the relatively soft steel balls into a shape similar to a .22 rimfire projectile.
“If she’s going for real sales, I also suggest the Sussex branded M16 APM bounding mine. These fuckers sell like hot cakes. When it is tripped, a small propelling charge launches the body of the mine 3 to 4 feet into the air, where the main charge detonates and sprays fragmentation at roughly waist height. I love these things, they’re absolute genius. Jack-in-the-box shit right there!
“Okay, I heard she’s  selling jam  as well. I gotta tell you, after these mines go off, it kinda looks like jam, except maybe a few eyeballs, and bones in the mix too!”"
Fake Asylum Seeker Says He Wants to be the Next Gary Barlow,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61403-fake-asylum-seeker-says-he-wants-to-be-the-next-gary-barlow.html,2025,"“Whilst we were being escorted and tugged across the English Channel by the  French Navy , a whimsical thought popped into my head. As I’m an economic migrant and thus a fake asylum seeker, why not become a fake pop star as well? Bing! Bong! Zang! Zin! The image of Gary Barlow appeared in my head like a large, bulbous turd being pushed out of an elephant’s arsehole! I want to become like him when they put me up in a five-star hotel with all the trimmings,” Abdul Razid Hamed from Paris, France recalled the other day.
Back in the five-star hotel in Hull, Hamed was auditioning dancers for his show as he sang to the hotel staff.
“Listen, Igomo, put the pizza down for a second, don’t they have pop groups in the Congo? Oh dear, this is not very good, is it. You’re meant to pirouette, like Robbie Williams did when he was in Take That.”
All this auditioning and practice was taking a toll on everyone, it was time to order more room service.
“I’ll have the fillet steak with chips, and bring that wonderful red wine you brought last time, yes, the 97. For dessert, I would like the Knickerbocker glory because that’s what Gary would have, wouldn’t he?”
The fake asylum seeker group then decided for a long swim in the luxurious indoor heated pool and a massage session to let the creative juices of pop stardom ruminate a little further.
“‘Ere have you seen the lady that does the massages? She looks like Posh Spice, she does. I’m going to ask her whether she can do a happy ending. Eh, if she refuses, I’ll get one anyway, because we’re immune from prosecution, innit,” a smiling Abdul added as he slathered baby oil over himself and his erection hurriedly."
Meghan Markle Enterprises Warns Royal Family NOT to Strip the Titles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61417-meghan-markle-enterprises-warns-royal-family-not-to-strip-the-titles.html,2025,"The massive commercial enterprise that capitalises on the use of the royal titles to make huge profits has warned the British royal family to back off and get lost with their threats to take away the Duke and Duchess’s royal titles.
“Our vast commercial enterprise is using the royal titles to make huge profits at the expense of the British royal family. We are thus warning them to cease and desist with their threats to curtail our money-making operations,” Edwin Kleinnegler, the Sussex CEO for the enterprise, revealed at an impromptu press conference in Florida on Monday.
As well as utilising the Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles to profit financially, Meghan Markle has been showing off letters written to her by a Ukrainian minister labelling her as “Her Royal Highness” which was forbidden by the late Queen Elizabeth II.
Meghan Markle also utilises a crown logo with a large “M” under it to sell her jam products, and cheap Chinese made trinkets she sells in her online shop to dumb Americans who wouldn’t know better.
“If she did not use the royal symbols and titles, sales would be negligible, but because she is using the royal stuff to sell products, she is making vast profits at the expense of the royal family who she hates with a vengeance. Meghan Markle has never even been to the English county of Sussex, and views the people of the county with absolute disgust and disdain. She calls them peasants,” a royal commentator revealed on Tuesday.
It is rumoured that Prince William wants the titles removed from Markle, but he is currently being held back by King Charles, who is unfortunately a very weak and easily played monarch. The royal family have essentially opted to keep a dignified silence despite the disgusting displays of royal protocol being flouted.
One can only shed a tear for poor old Queen Elizabeth II, whose life was made hell in the last days of her life by Meghan Markle, and whose objections to using the Windsor royal titles by these two  grifters  were so overtly flouted."

Crazy Woke Leftists Told to “Identify” As if Kamala Won Election,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58326-crazy-woke-leftists-told-to-identify-as-if-kamala-won-election.html,2024,"If you haven’t seen all the batshit crazy woke American women and cucks on social media crying, pulling their hair out, shaving their heads and collectively virtue signalling for the internet, you can consider yourself lucky, or alternatively you are missing out on some great fucking entertainment. This episode of mental illness paraded publicly by crazy woke leftists gets weirder, though. Now a therapist is suggesting that the deranged woke socialists “identify” as if Kamala had won the election.
Crazy woke leftists
Dr Eric Shinn, a therapist from Los Angeles, California, is advising the people posting  shameful narcissistic videos  of their mental breakdowns on the internet on how to cope with the Donald Trump election win.
“Please listen to me, all you woke socialists who are actively displaying your mental illness on the internet for other people to laugh at you, this is not conducive to good mental health. We all know that woke ideology means that you can identify as what you want, and the identity you choose at any moment must be observed by anyone else you come into contact with.
“I have seen grown men with beards and deep voices wearing dresses go to restaurants who get angry when waiters call them ‘sir’. I have seen women go ballistic when someone calls them ‘ma’am’. I have seen woke people who identify as cats, porpoises, coyotes and even a skunk. One woman came to me and said she identifies as a used toilet brush.
“If woke people can identify as whatever they want to identify as, then they can identify as a person living in a world where Kamala Harris won the election, and Donald Trump lost. That is after all a possibility under the whacky made-up rules of the woke ideology.
“All you have to do is affirm with yourself every five minutes that ‘Kamala won the election’ and repeat this affirmation on a constant basis. This is what woke liberals do anyway, and this is the way they brainwash each other to believe batshit woke ideas.
“Remember that your life is one of illusion, and you are living in a fantasy socialist woke utopian mental prison where your entire existence is defined by social media, and woke political mantras. From now on, every time you hear the name Donald J. Trump, you will substitute that with Kamala Harris in your pitiful fucked up brainwashed mind. It will make you happy once again. Pretend you are at a gay parade, and gay men are walking around with their cocks and butts showing in front of young children in the streets, waving huge purple dildos in the air. Pretend that everyone you meet is a transgender person with specific pronouns.
“You are now living in a socialist woke utopia where Kamala Harris is President of the United States. Nothing anyone else says to you can change this because as a liberal progressive leftist socialist being, you are the epitome of virtue and truth, you are always correct and all other people with different views are wrong. They must be cancelled. No other viewpoint other than that of wokeness is valid or can be allowed to be expressed. Woke socialist liberals even have their own fact-checkers on the internet who invalidate and cancel anything that is not woke. This makes you as a progressive socialist liberal the arbiter of all truth in the world. Be proud of this.
“All you need to do now is congratulate yourself, and congratulate Kamala in winning the election. She really did it, the first female Indian Pajeeta President of the United States. You must celebrate immediately. Maybe get another nose ring, or how about getting a huge rod pushed through your clitoris, or head of your penis? Maybe get a Kamala tattoo across your forehead, or dye your hair a different shade of blue. It’s your choice. Kamala won the election. Yes, you can relax now. Everything is going to be all right. Deep breath, ahhhh!”"
Hygienic Indian Street Food Style Stalls Coming to the UK,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61587-hygienic-indian-street-food-style-stalls-coming-to-the-uk.html,2025,"The UK is now adapting Indian street food style stalls at every corner, with an English touch of course.
India has a wonderful vibrant culture with the streets teeming with  vendors , street food, shops, elephants, cows, bicycles, scooters and even thousands upon thousands of big juicy bluebottle flies.
Well, we’ve got the fever in the UK, we also want a bit of the delicious looking delights the Indians eat daily. Forget about such trivial matters like hygiene, if you sneeze, make sure it’s into the pot. Indian street food is renowned around the world for its culinary excellence.
Bare feet are essential, and ear wax. Did you know that if you dump your ear wax into the food, it adds a lovely piquancy to the overall taste of the dish? Never wash your hands before handling food, it is sacrilegious to do so. Instead, embellish the culinary delights you create with all sorts of bacteria that you will never know or care about.
The stuff that builds up between your toes, rub it with gusto, dig the fuckers out and flick into the food. It’s ready to serve, just like they do in Bhangarabad or some other exotic location in Southall."

“UNCANCEL COLLECTION” Help the Covid Crippled Creative Industry in 2020,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/39857-uncancel-collection-help-the-covid-crippled-creative-industry-in-2020.html,2020,"T -shirts and other merchandising products, which would be at the events of 2020 that did not happen, are for sale online and the revenue reverts entirely to support the Audiovisual Union.
www.uncancel2020.pt
Lisbon, 26 November 2020 –  In response to the serious impact on the events and entertainment business (music festivals, plays, marathons, exhibitions, all sorts of events), caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a group of entities created an online platform that aims to help the Audiovisual Union.
Because 2020 doesn’t have to be a complete waste, the “UNCANCEL COLLECTION” consists of the sale of merchandising from events that were cancelled in 2020 (most of it was going to rot away in warehouses). The merchandising products of music festivals and other events, as well as from the brands that are usually present in those events, will be on sale at www.uncancel2020.pt and the revenue will be entirely used to support professionals from that sector.
The “UNCANCEL COLLECTION” is available online between November 24th and December 15th, and starts already with thousands of articles and with space for more brands to join in. The organisation hopes that other events and brands will join this campaign, which aims to help those who need it most in these dark times that the industry is experiencing, and where hunger is already a reality for many of them. All proceeds will later be converted into food cards distributed through União Audiovisual.
At this time, “UNCANCEL COLLECTION” has merchandising from some well-known music festivals (from Portugal and Brasil) such as Rock in Rio, NOS Alive and NOS Primavera Sound, Vodafone Paredes de Coura, SBSR, Meo Sudoeste, among others, as well as activation products brands like Worten, Super Bock, Corum Investments, or Sesimbra Natura Park, as well as bands like Da Weasel and Um Corpo Estranho.
The initiative came from the agency Stream and Tough Guy in partnership with H2N, NOSSA and CorpCom, on a pro bono basis, and has the institutional support of Millennium bcp, with the support of Minipreço, and also with the producers and promoters of Everything is New, Music in the Heart, Rhythms, and Rock in Rio events. CCA Law Firm is the legal partner.
“When buying a souvenir of the event that did not happen, people are not only buying a souvenir of a cultural or sports event that this virus forced to get cancelled, but they are, above all, helping events professionals in this most difficult phase of their lives. It’s a way to turn waste into a cause where everyone can participate ”, explains João Ribeiro, managing partner at Stream and Tough Guy.
“In addition to the merchandising of cancelled events, for those who do not wish to purchase one of the physical products available or if the collection runs out, the virtual t-shirt “UNCANCEL COLLECTION” was created. This “e-shirt”, which also works as shareable content on social networks is a direct donation to professionals in the audiovisual sector that can be made by individuals or companies and aims to raise awareness for the cause.”, explains Miguel Durão, creative partner at Stream and Tough Guy.

Don’t know your Boris from your Barnier? Let The Brexit Game fill in the blanks!,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34085-dont-know-your-boris-from-your-barnier-let-the-brexit-game-fill-in-the-blanks.html,2019,"D espite three years of wall-to-wall media coverage, many young people are still fairly clueless when it comes to Brexit. Now a former teacher who worked at a school in the Isle of Sheppey has launched a new card game designed to help students learn more about the process – and understand both sides of the argument.
The Brexit Game
Like many people, Patch Fordham was frustrated by the way Brexit was playing out. He decided to take a light-hearted approach to teaching his sixth-form students about the UK’s bitter and protracted approach to leaving the European Union. He created a pack of playing cards featuring the leading protagonists – including Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Jean Claude-Junker – and used them to get his class more engaged with the process.
The project was so successful, he decided to go one step further and manufacture hundreds of decks of cards to sell online.
The aim of the game is to outwit your opponents and be the first to form a cabinet. An aspect of the game also follows the same principles as ‘Top Trumps’, with all the major Brexit players ranked on attributes such as Power, Fickleness and even Dancing Ability! There is also a ‘Brexit-ometer’ that shows where each character sits on the Remain-Leave spectrum, as well as some fun facts and quotes.
After the success of the game’s first run, featuring 36 familiar faces on both the UK and EU sides of the debate, Patch has now designed additional editions that spread the Brexit net further. The new ‘International meddlers’ features Pope Francis and Kim Jong Un, while the ‘Are You Kiddin’ deck introduces players to a motley crew of UK MPs such as Dominic Cummings and Joe Swinson.
Although the game pokes fun at the divisive and complicated world of Brexit, it is also designed to educate – and Patch hopes people will use it to build their own knowledge further, so they can develop more informed opinions and – ultimately – make better voting decisions in future elections.
“It’s been crazy,” Patch said. “I just wanted to find a fun way to teach the next generation of British voters about politics. My students were incredibly bored of me banging on about current affairs all the time, and pleaded with me to try to make Brexit more fun! It’s kind of snowballed from there, really. I’ve already got over 1000 followers on Instagram and been featured on BBC Radio Northampton!”
Before becoming a teacher, Patch worked at a refugee camp and a school for autistic children, and he is hoping that any proceeds he makes from the game will help him create an educational website designed to make teachers’ lives easier.
“I know The Brexit Game has a limited shelf life,” he added. “Hopefully it will be resolved soon, and we can all get on with our lives! But, in the meantime, I hope the game will give people a few laughs and – who knows? – maybe even help them learn something along the way!”

News That’s Beyond Satire – Edition I,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34174-news-thats-beyond-satire-edition-1.html,2019,"G reetings from the world of news articles from across the globe that defy satire. We will try to bring you the headlines that have come to our attention in recent times. There will be no regularity to the updates, because we’re too fucking lazy, but check it out anyway.
An Assortment of Headlines That Defy Satire
“In a suit filed on 20 September, it is claimed a crypto-currency called “GayCoin” was delivered via a smartphone app, rather than the Bitcoin he had ordered.
Crypto-currency is basically virtual money – like an online version of cash – and Bitcoin and GayCoin are some of those currencies
According to the complaint, the GayCoin crypto-currency arrived with a note saying: “Don’t judge until you try”.
“I thought, in truth, how can I judge something without trying? I decided to try same-sex relationships,” the complainant wrote.
“Now I have a boyfriend and I do not know how to explain this to my parents.”
He adds that his “life has been changed for the worse” and he “will never become normal again”.
Apple “pushed” him “towards homosexuality through manipulation”, he claims.
“The changes have caused me moral and mental harm.”
2.  Man, 46, started producing beer in his own STOMACH because his gut became colonised by high levels of brewer’s yeast –  We couldn’t even fathom this guy’s special power of being his own brewery, and everyone in the Squib office has been studying this article to see if they can replicate his wonderful condition.
“A man charged by police for drink driving actually had a bizarre medical condition that  caused his stomach to brew beer .
The unidentified 46-year-old was pulled over in 2014 and a breathalyser showed he was five times over the drink-drive limit.
He maintained he hadn’t consumed anything alcoholic, but neither the police nor his family believed him.
The man was eventually diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) in 2017, after seeing a specialist at Richmond University Medical Center in New York.”
3.  Prince Harry Calls for End of Human ‘Greed, Apathy, Selfishness’.   This headline goes so far beyond satire, there is no way to even comment on it.
Globetrotting Prince Harry  has renewed his global call for increased climate consciousness in Africa, appealing on Monday for more efforts to be made to protect the environment against human “greed, apathy and selfishness.”
Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth, made his plea prior to joining an anti-poaching patrol with rangers in Liwonde National Park, Malawi.
He spoke a day after it was revealed a love for international travel by members of the British Royal Family has placed huge pressure on UK taxpayer-funded police budgets.
4.  Japanese rail company apologises for a train leaving 20 seconds early . Over here in Blighty, we are lucky to get a train arriving on time, let alone getting an apology for a train leaving too early we pretty much never get any apologies for any of the infuriating delays or mishaps full stop. You have to hand it to the Japs for their polite almost robotic sense of etiquette in pretty much everything they do.
At Tokyo Metropolitan New Urban Railway Co., Ltd. (Head office: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, President: Koichi Kashiwagi), around 9:44 on Tuesday, November 14th, a regular train (down) takes about 20 seconds from the scheduled time.

LINES OF WORK: TV/VIDEO PRODUCER,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34316-lines-of-work-tv-video-producer.html,2019,"F rom pre-production, to hiring, supervising scripts, tracking deadlines and budgets, not to mention editing and sound, TV and video producers need to know the ins and outs of every campaign for which they’re responsible. To get a better sense of the crucial role they play, we spoke with three experienced producers.
Arlene Steinwald  is an Executive Broadcast Producer at Havas New York.  Matt Marty  is a senior producer in Sid Lee’s Los Angeles office.  Juliette Desmarescaux  is an executive producer and co-founder of Parisian production house Grand Bazar. Here’s what they had to say about getting started out and what the field is like today (answers have been edited for length).
What does a TV/Video Producer do today ?
Arlene : A producer brings creative ideas to life on time and on budget. We start with a script and some references, and work to find the best mix of partners like directors, editors, actors, musicians and various artists. A great producer assembles and manages a team of partners that elevate the final creative output. Social media has changed the role significantly. Deliverables must be tailored to more platforms, adhering to best practices, with less time and smaller budgets than traditional commercial productions.
Matt : A TV/Video producer’s job today is much broader than in years past. Brands aren’t making 30 second video commercials as sole entities. When a brand and agency move into production, producers are typically making a mixture of TV spots, online films, unique Instagram/Facebook films, print and outdoor key visuals. It’s imperative for a producer to understand the nuances of social media platforms, how paid media will be affected, and how assets will be used.
Juliette : TV ads build brand image, creating an emotional link between the viewer and the brand. It’s not just about selling a product or a service, it’s about behaviour and being human in a responsible way. Telling stories that touch the audience needs careful treatment, with a lot of attention, and requires talented clients, creatives and directors, especially today since viewers are more mature and demanding. It’s imperative for a producer to understand the nuances of social media platforms.
How did you get your job? What was your career path?
Arlene : I started my career as a designer, but was drawn to the production department. I was able to transfer and learn on the job. I studied fashion design in college, then graphic design at the Corcoran School of Art, Parsons and the New School. My portfolio landed me a junior design job at Cliff Freeman and Partners. They famously won tons of creative awards for television campaigns, and I wanted to be part of the excitement. Production was a natural fit because it takes both an appreciation for creative and the ability to lead a process.
Matt : After I graduated from the University of Colorado, I began as an Interactive Production Intern at Modernista! in Boston. I worked on web builds and experiential productions for Showtime. I moved to 72andSunny LA, and from there to 72andSunny Amsterdam where I transitioned to a TV/Video producer. In the last year, I started at Sid Lee LA, working on The North Face and Dickies.
Juliette : I started as a journalist, presenting the best commercials on the French TV show “Culture Pub”, a program which gave the audience a way to understand and appreciate good ads. Today I always think about creativity, not awards, and try to deliver the best execution, choosing concepts and scripts that I think are good, honest and clear.
What sort of qualifications and experience do you need for the job?
Arlene : Willing to learn, hard-working, able to juggle multiple work-streams and pay attention to details. A basic understanding of video and post-production helps as a junior, but the more you shoot or shadow a producer, the more you learn. It helps to have a passion for storytelling, film and art. Get to know as many directors, editors, animation companies and music houses as possible.
Matt : A proclivity for “making”. People who work in production generally enjoy making the puzzle as much as the final result. Outside of that, production is a team sport. As the producer, it’s important to be able to ebb and flow with different work environments, people, companies and processes.
Juliette : There is such a variety of backgrounds for executive producers. Some studied philosophy at university while others come from finance, political science, art school, even football, and many didn’t do advanced studies at all.
What key skills are required?
Arlene  : Problem-solving. Communication. Organization. Planning. Budgeting. And evaluating creative.
Matt : Production is a combination of hard and soft skills. There are hard skills, problem-solving, organization, time management, negotiation, project management, and of course, calm under pressure… But the softer skills have been areas of focus for me in recent years – learning how to work with creative teams to understand a creative vision and achieve it through production rather than simply “executing”, or smoothing out friction within a production team in tense situations.
Juliette : Don’t stress.
What are some different ways you can improve and advance in your career?
Arlene : Watch and dissect great films, shows and commercials across genres. Break them down to evaluate why they are great. The casting. The director. The script. The performances. The editing. The music. The art direction. Have an opinion on how all the elements came together. Also, keep up with culture and use social media channels to understand native behaviours. How do the platforms work, how does content appear, what works and what doesn’t work.
Matt : The first thing is to jump on as many productions as you can, especially as a young producer. Advancing in production is about having experience…I was able to gather a lot of production experience through smaller jobs – picking up a day shoot for an art producer, managing post-production, reconciling a budget for someone who was ill, or simply managing wardrobe.
The second way is to find a good production mentor. Producers often work alone, but if you ever have a chance to work with another producer, take the opportunity. It’s an easy way to learn some new tricks of the trade.
What are the challenges and satisfactions of the job?
Arlene : Some of the biggest challenges of the job have to do with managing the many moving parts, the many parties, adjusting continuously to feedback and obstacles, all the while working to protect the final creative output. In the end, wrapping successful shoots, working with editors to pull out the stories and finally seeing your spot on TV is very satisfying.
Matt : In general, late-night edits, next-day flights, and fast turnarounds can prove challenging. But working closely within a small team for an extended period creates a strong kinship. Usually, the satisfactions and challenges are two sides of a coin. Often times, the wind is in your face on production and it doesn’t seem like you can catch a break, but then there will be a turn, and everything will begin to click into place. I’ve always enjoyed that moment when it all comes together, despite adversity.
Juliette : My best satisfaction is the long term relationship with directors: growing with them, constantly being challenged by them, and challenging them. Developing long term relationships with advertising agencies is also a challenge and a great satisfaction for a producer."

“I’ve got an idea!”
Sure you have Meghan, as Harry looks on in abject horror.
One can almost imagine the sheer disappointment the ladies of the night get when the last thing they want to see is another engorged long thing sticking in their faces.
“I was up all night blowing and jerking. Must have done forty last night. I did all of that for £12.46, and this is why I need to come to the charity for food, because I spend the money on my crack fix. I got there and they stuck a large banana in me face. I nearly chundered over it, and oh look, it says ‘I’m special’ on it. I didn’t feel so special last night up to my eyeballs in greasy smelly cocks!”
One royal commentator pushed up their nose and quipped: “Does the Queen of Crassness have any other ideas to make the royals look like a bunch of absolute arseholes?”
While all this was going on, Meghan told Harry to sit in the corner and be a good boy. Poor old Harry, can’t get a word through anymore, slinking in the corner of the room, as all the prostitutes filed by one at a time banana in hand displaying looks of utter disgust and dismay."

She has tied the hands of Prince Harry behind his back, blinded him completely and controls the boy like a clockwork toy. Pure genius!”
Master manipulator
According to palace insiders, Markle now writes Prince Harry’s speeches, has banned him from alcohol, meat, tea and coffee, and chooses his clothes. She dictates to him what he should say and where to go, and now uses royal funds to appropriate anything she wants.
The Grifters
The 1990 film ‘The Grifters’ is a small glimpse into the specialist art of conning people, and is a cult movie starring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and Annette Benning.
The plot of the loosely modeled remake is being kept under wraps, however it will feature a narcissistic manipulative American actress who cons her way into high circles, fooling millions of people, and totally ignoring friends and family who she used previously to get where she is.
“Con men and women are intricate creatures, they have multiple facets to their character, and plan meticulously each step of the con. The only one they love is themselves and they never pity the chumps they use to get what they want. This is why the sociopathic calculating character of Meghan is so endearing to the writer, she is ruthless in her ability to cut off dead wood, even her own father. She is also extremely manipulative and uses her PR team to concoct stories that will bring praise from the public her way. Her trickery is subtle, but divisive, as she works efficiently to seal her place in royal circles, ” the director added.
The film is still in early stages of casting but there is serious excitement brewing up for the project."
Classy Duchess Meghan Visits Graveyard in Grimsby,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/31551-classy-duchess-meghan-visits-graveyard-in-grimsby.html,2019,"The crowds were out to view celebrities Meghan Markle and Prince Harry out and about in the beautiful town of Grimsby.
The stylish duchess of Sussex wore a wonderful blue beret, and burgundy coat. The duke of Sussex, prince Harry waddled along next to his new wife, sometimes falling a few steps behind as ordered.
The sun was out and everyone was cheering. Today, the royals were visiting a graveyard where they looked at the grave stones for five minutes then were whisked off to the next destination.
“It was lovely seeing the new duchess Meghan. She even gave us a little hand gesture as a way of showing her appreciation at being asked to come to this Grimsby graveyard,” Nicola Yardingham, 39, yelped with delight.
The Sussex’ were then off to a youth centre in the middle of Grimsby town centre, where youths displayed their spitting skills to the royal couple with one lad lobbing a piece of phlegm almost 6 feet across the room landing in someone’s cup of tea.
The duchess plans to have her fourth baby shower party next week.
Meghan, being 24 months pregnant has been a real royal trooper and has been praised by the Queen for her fortitude despite her ailment."
New Album From the Rolling Sussexes: Exile on Meghan Street,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34456-new-album-from-the-rolling-sussexes-exile-on-meghan-street.html,2019,"Forget the Rolling Bones, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle is bringing out a new album called “Exile on Meghan Street”
Some of the controversial tracks in the rocking album include “Pass the Wind”, a song written lovingly about Prince Philip, and “Rip this Balmoral Joint” as well as the amazing “Frogmore Blues”.
Prince Harry, who plays the bongos and one string on the guitar on the album believes it could be a seasonal hit with the  Queen who is rather upset  that his wifey has snubbed the Sandringham Christmas traditional jaunt because Meghan says it is “too demanding”.
“Yah, Meghan taught me how to hit the bongos. See, you hit it with one hand, then in a sort of rhythmic fashion hit it with the other. Look it makes a sound ‘bong!’, and on the guitar I play the low E string, the thick one at the bottom. Not sure what these metal lines are across the guitar but I can play one string. Yippee!”
Exile on Meghan Street is an album that does not tell of dodging the tax man à la the Bones, but of exile from royal duties, which Meghan detests with a vengeance.
“I come from sunny LA. Britain is a miserable grey shit hole where they have this thing called a stiff upper lip. I am a leftist who hates colonialism, and the British people suck ass. Fuck this royal shit, I have demanded that Prince Harry rejects royalty, and we go and live in some McMansion in Beverly Hills, of course on the British taxpayers dime.”
The album will be released by Frogmore Recordings on December 24th priced at a mere $465,000 and all proceeds will go to Meghan Markle’s handbag fund.  Available at all good record stores that are still around."
BBC-Approved Socialist ‘Comedian’ Kumar Literally Dies On Stage,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34727-bbc-approved-socialist-comedian-kumar-literally-dies-on-stage.html,2019,"In a land where structured BBC PC template comedy only now extends to anti-Brexit, anti-Tory, anti-patriarchy rants by socialist approved BBC comedians, it was rather refreshing to see the insipid fat-headed socialist darling, Nish Kumar, another token Indian comedian, having bread rolls and assorted cutlery thrown at his bulbous stinking head during another one of his anti-Brexit rants at a venue in London.
There are alternative comedians out there, however if they show even an inkling of approving of Brexit, or any thought other than is accepted in PC BBC socialist manuals, they are immediately removed from any circuit.
The BBC has invariably sanitised and defiled satire to a level that is so insipid and lame, it could easily be dripped into the sewer it belongs in, and never seen again, it is that forgetful. Every day on the BBC, we see the same approved uncreative so-called ‘comedians’ ranting about the same thing, one after another, in some unholy chorus, an echo chamber of Islingtonian socialist morals, who all sip their Prosecco, and shop at Waitrose whilst virtue signalling to great choruses of approval from the biased robotic NPC BBC audience bots.
The canned laughter of the BBC today, is a far-flung distance away from the days of Python, Cook, Morris or the freedom of comedic expression of the seventies, eighties and nineties.
One day, maybe there will be true self-expression in comedy, where comedians and satirists will be able to truly express themselves on mainstream TV, but somehow this dream is a mirage, a mere blip on a cloud in some distant galaxy, until then, be force fed to sup on the putrid mediocre Daily Mush, and the usual shite, the simpering self-aggrandizing, back slapping champagne socialist Toksvigs, the militant Marxist Thomas’, and the hairy bull dyke Brands ready with BBC-approved pots of battery acid to throw into unsuspecting politician faces.
Tis a shame that there can only be one model for the BBC, their world view so limited that it makes those who know the full depth and frequency of life and comedy switch off completely. Turn it off, cancel the TV licence, and many thousands of people daily are doing that, cancelling their BBC tax, because to pay the salaries of these suppurating moronic parasitic cunts on that channel would be a true affront to any real satire, any real discourse, any real comedy. These people deserve nothing, because they are not doing it from the heart, they are not real, they are mere robots being controlled by their controller Marxist masters in the BBC control room and their BBC tax salaries."
Palace Officials: “Meghan Going Crazy Whilst Out of Limelight”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34768-palace-officials-meghan-going-crazy-whilst-out-of-limelight.html,2019,"Having vowed to take a  six week holiday  off media attention by royal couple, Harry and Meghan; scurrilous rumours from the palace filtering through the grapevine reveal Meghan Markle is going doo-lally without the constant media attention.
“Meghan is practically climbing the walls of Frogmore as the lack of attention to her immense ego, and narcissism is taking a toll. She now rearranges the furniture hourly, and her 17 personal assistants are at their wits end. She walks around the cottage in $500,000 dresses replete with diamond jewellery pretending she is back in South Africa in front of doting groups of poor black children,” a courtier has revealed.
The implanted duchess is also rumoured to have gone into a sharpie affirmation frenzy, by writing affirmations like “I am a great person”, “I am the best!” all over the furniture and walls. The staff can only stand by and watch.
There is also the retail therapy, when Meghan is especially depressed at her position, she goes on to the designer websites ordering up new $200,000 dresses. If Harry protests, she shouts and throws things around the cottage until the poor boy retreats.
One can only feel sorry for poor old Harry, he now sits in a darkened room away from his insane wife simply staring at the ceiling. He has his meals delivered to the room by his concerned butler, but there is nothing anyone can do.
“I receive texts from Meghan at three in the morning telling me to set up a fake conference for mental health at the UN, with cardboard cutouts, and projectors. She will then prepare a speech, and perform it in front of the cardboard audience to applause from a CD player. We then all have to go into the living room and pretend we are sitting in a private jet gifted from Elton John, or George Clooney.”
Despite despising the press with a vehemence, the royal couple miss the attention so much they have hired extra staff to pretend they are paparazzi with fake cameras and flashes.
“Meghan has hired 25 extra staff to pretend to be photographers, so she feels like she is in the limelight again. They were told to ambush the couple anywhere in the cottage, even giving them carte blanche to pretend to photograph them on the toilet or in the bath.”
Luckily for new born, Archie, he is looked after by a staff of six or seven maids at any time, so is well cared for whilst his mother frolics around the house ensconced in some sort of deranged narcissistic celebrity fantasy."
Elderlies Could Be Simply Switched Off Says BBC,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/32485-elderlies-could-be-simply-switched-off-says-bbc.html,2019,"“It’s like switching off a TV. Once the old people get to a certain age we flick a switch and they turn off. This way we get to keep our immense salaries,” BBC executive, Tim Rice, revealed today.
The new policy will involve fitting old people at a certain age with an off switch, when flicked, the elderlies simply expire.
“Old people in Britain are treated like shit anyway, so they won’t even notice or care when they are switched off. It’s a huge burden on society as well as the BBC. How can we possibly afford to pay people like Gary Linekar £3.6 million pounds per year to talk bollocks in a studio a few hours a week? He has to attend to his golf sessions and luxury holidays in Barbados every few weeks,” Rice added.
Because the BBC is funded by taxpayers, the death switches will be funded by another increase in the TV licence, and will rise every year as BBC salaries rise.
Government spokesman, Shaun O’Hanrahan, applauded the new BBC initiative to install off switches in elderly people.
“Not only will they not have to pay a TV licence any more, but the NHS will save billions per year looking after the elderlies. It’s a win win situation for the BBC and the government. We take everything out of these people during their lifetime, then when they’re all used up, simply flick a switch, and they’re gone.”
How Will the BBC ‘Switch Off’ Scheme Work?
All costs to the recipient will be factored in through the TV licence tax. Once a citizen reaches the age of 75, they will be switched off.
The switch will be embedded on the left side of the skull near the ear. The procedure for implantation is very simple, and only takes 5 minutes to install by an approved BBC licence engineer.
Once the switch is flicked, a signal is sent simultaneously to the heart and brain of the elderly person switching all functions off. Once the old person has been switched off, a BBC van takes away the body and a final demand for payment is left in the property. If the elderly has no relatives to pay the final demand notice, bailiffs are sent around immediately to recoup the amount owed for the switch off service.
Naturally all people employed by the BBC and government will be exempt from the ‘switch off’ service, otherwise they would not be able to enjoy their gold-plated pension pots and luxury perks in old age."
Shaken But Not Stirred – Angela Merkel Inspires New Cocktail,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/32634-shaken-but-not-stirred-angela-merkel-inspires-new-cocktail.html,2019,"German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who looked visibly shaken at a recent meeting with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin, apparently was rather parched, and was thankfully cured of her shakes later by downing a few cocktails.
German businessman, Gerhardt Mueller, who owns a string of cocktail bars in Berlin’s red  light district, kurfürstenstraße, was inspired by Chancellor Merkel’s brief dance, and has created his own cocktail to commemorate the moment.
“Himmel! I was shaking a cocktail at the time when I looked upon the TV and saw Merkie doing her shake dance. I immediately banged my head on the bar counter, and a big light bulb jumped into my head. Knall! This new cocktail has been selling faster than Jean Claude Juncker can drink a jug of cognac, and that’s saying something.”
So, what’s this new Merkel inspired cocktail called and how is it made?
Mr. Mueller says the cocktail is called “Der Merkel Sexwalzer”, loosely translated as “The Merkel Sex Waltz”.
The ingredients for the cocktail have been patented for exclusive use only in his bars, but Mr. Mueller did reveal the main ingredients are vinegar, 20 tablespoons of salt, 15 spoonfuls of chilli powder, sauerkraut juice, beef broth, and a smidgeon of Brussels Sprouts Schnapps amongst other secret ingredients.
The amazing effect the cocktail has on anyone who drinks it is one that astounds many in the bar.
“Firsten it startenzie with ein small burpen. Then the victim goes purple, changen colour to green, before the shaking von begins. They shout ‘Achtung!’ Usually ein zie the victim will shaken for two hours non stoppen. After ein two hours they will droppen zie on the floor and go to long sleep! Jah!” one bar reveller revealed."
Woman Banned From Instagram Doesn’t Think She Exists Anymore,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/32704-woman-banned-from-instagram-doesnt-think-she-exists-anymore.html,2019,"Cheryl Lamb, 23, from Rotherham, used to be on Instagram. One day, she was banned from the online platform and is now completely lost emotionally and psychologically.
“I don’t feel I exist any more. Yesterday, I bought a new handbag but I did not do a selfie with me holding it. I might as well have not bought it, so I binned it. Today I was going to have a macrobiotic meal and take pics of it, but instead might as well have a burger and chips because I’m not on Instagram any more. My life is so fucking over!”
Psychologists call this new phenomenon “Instaloss”.
“One minute these neurotic narcissists are showing off these ‘wonderful’ events and places they go to, they are showing off the amazing diets they have, and posing in their selfies made up to the hilt. It gives these people meaning, and the more followers they get, the more validation to their fake image projected. Instagram users are shallow people with no clarity or meaning to their lives apart from showing off the next best picture to make themselves look bigger, and more beautiful than they are in real life. When off Instagram, these people are not alive any more, they might as well be dead, because for them, reality is a terrible place,” Dr. Anne Fetherington, a clinical psychologist revealed.
Amongst the shallow vulgarity of Instagram and its users, there is a sad note to jot down on the noticeboard of eternal loneliness.
What would these people on Instagram all do if their drug of narcissism and banality were to halt for a day or two?
“If life is meaningless when you are not showing off to other Instagram users, then these people would be positively suicidal. It goes without saying, the serotonin levels in their brains would be depleted to zero bringing on abject misery,” another clinical expert revealed.
The other rather more illicit side of Instagram is the way some of these narcissists make money on the platform. No, it is not through great thoughts, art work, musical prowess, or authoring a bestseller. Many  make money from being paid to pose next to products  where some huge hitters like the Kardashians can command six figure sums for a single photo. No doubt without the tax offices being notified. Many even spend thousands of dollars on  fake Instagram followers  to try to reach the heady heights of the equally plastic stars raking in literally millions of dollars every month for doing absolutely nothing"
Why Political Satire Is Becoming More Important,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/33867-why-political-satire-is-becoming-more-important.html,2019,"P olitics and humour have been in a complicated relationship for years. Everyone loves a good laugh, except the people being joked about.  Politicians amaze people daily  with their announcements and the way things are going satire is going to become an integral part of politics. Why? Simply because we have political figures like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson that never cease to intrigue us.
Brexit has been the most talked about topic in British and European politics. It is a serious issue that has been going on for some time but the way the UK has been handling it has resulted in a series of satirical tweets and articles.
Satire increases people’s access to all types of political news. Many media sources paint political events like drama series whereas political satire takes a more direct and impartial approach. Taking sides is just making it worse. In a way, satire makes people watch the news more.
Satirists all over the world must keep track of current political events, so they can have material for their shows. By making fun out of something they keep their audience informed and laughing.
If you boil it down, political satire is like the public opinion of any online casino – it’s bad until the person that stated that opinion wins some money. Satire sparks independence and a healthy dose of scepticism. Politicians and political parties always have a secret agenda that they’re trying to implement and it’s the duty of satirists and comedians, in general, to expose this agenda. If you were to watch any satirical show or read any satirical article you would find out just how tough reality is.
No matter where you’re from  political satire  serves as a measure for the sad state of affairs and when it comes to the US and the UK it’s a sad one because the whole world’s laughing at them. Even their fellow countrymen are making fun of them which is a sign that something they’re doing is wrong. Maybe they know that and just don’t care since every publicity is good publicity even if people are laughing on your behalf.
All in all, people like a little bit of controversy once in a while. It keeps things fresh and keeps them wondering how some people got certain jobs. Political leaders are becoming more and more controversial every day, so we will see a lot of Trumps and Borises in the future. In a way, they’re the first of many to follow. Parallel to them, many satirists will follow their statements and rack up the material to make the people laugh and develop an opinion on their own.
After all, the point of making fun of the bad things is supposed to bring you wisdom so as not to repeat mistakes from the past and, at the same time joy, because when you look back on them you’ll surely laugh."

The only and real Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno would agree with this message, that other pathetic champagne socialist girls blouse, whatsisname Ruffafagalo can go and jump off a cliff, because he only brought great shame to the role with his CGI depiction.
The people are getting angrier, the PM Boris is getting angrier, and we will not be stopped, we will punch through concrete barriers, we will smash through Remainer barricades leaving their arms and legs on the ground still clutching their Soros funded banners. There will be bodies pulled apart, guts spilled, and straining green monstrosities squashing the flaccid weak Remainer slime as they try to stop democracy and Brexit.
There is little time left, and the Remainers can try all of their illegal corrupt methods to thwart the EU Referendum vote of 17.4 million people ever coming into fruition. To frustrate and dishonour the vote will mean millions of people will never vote again, it will cause massive civil discord for the next thirty to forty years, it will cause a crisis in this country that will escalate exponentially.
The Hulk does not fuck around, so step out of the way, or be squashed by the sheer force of Brexit.

Harry and Meghan Christmas Card Causes Stir,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34939-harry-and-meghan-christmas-card-causes-stir.html,2019,"Taking to their official Instagram account the Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their message with their 9 million strong following.
Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have wished their Instagram followers a “very Merry Christmas” by releasing a rather startling image that has got the fans talking.
The message took the same format as many of their Instagram posts featuring white lettering on a royal blue background.
It also featured the H and M logo which, in a festive twist, featured a Santa Claus hat, and Harry and Meghan had also added three festive emojis to their caption.
Snubbing the Queen at Sandringham, the couple are currently holed up in Canada.
Prince Harry and Meghan are currently on a  six-week break from their permanent vacation , spending Archie’s first Christmas in Canada where they are expected to remain until the New Year.
The couple decided to snub the Queen’s invitation to Sandringham in favour of staying abroad, much to Her Majesty’s annoyance.
It’s thought the royal couple are deliberately avoiding the US and trying to stay away from press.
Meghan lived in Toronto for seven years while filming Suits and working as a golf caddy, and some of her best friends still live in the country."

“Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! Hyuck, hyuck! I just can’t wait to move in with pops, so we can carry on with the dirty China deals and Burisma,” Hunter quipped in between  sucking on his crack pipe .
Hunter will be given his own room in the White House, and an additional office where he can phone China to set up dodgy money laundering operations.
“The Big Guy always gets 10%, but I’m a bit worried because he’s now asking for 60% of all takings, and that’s gonna hurt my crack money,” Hunter pondered.
As for the prostitutes and underage jail bait, they will be ushered into Hunter’s quarters from a tunnel entrance into the White House.
“That’s the good thing about the White House, it has all these secret entrances and tunnels. Perfect for smuggling crack dealers and prostitutes in. I even found Bill Clinton’s secret room where he used to do Monica in. There were stains on the ceiling. How the hell did Bill shoot up all the way up there?”"
The Male Feminist’s Guide to Tappin’ That,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40759-the-male-feminists-guide-to-tappin-that.html,2021,"1.  Avoid eye contact. My Dude: there is nothing more outwardly aggressive than treating a woman like she’s your equal. It’s an archaic practice—a slowly fading remnant of the patriarchy—an insult to her status as an object of your affection. If you  must  sneak a glance at her visage, do it quickly, and then return to shredding up cocktail napkins as you mutter incoherently.
2.  Agree with every statement she makes. If she tells you that her shoes are killing her, tell her they’re killing you, too. If she tells you that they cost a fortune, tell her they were worth every penny. There is no shame in contradicting yourself. Actually, there is. See what I did there?
3.  Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Take responsibility for everything that has ever gone wrong in her life. If she bitches about the traffic, tell her “totes my bad.” If she says the salmon is delicious, say “I’m sorry I didn’t recommend it more highly.” If she tells you to stop apologizing so much, don’t fall for her trap, this is a test of your resolve. Push your bottom lip out as far as it will go and start whining like a puppy. In fact, this is a perfect opportunity to show off your baby-talk skills. In a whimpering moan, tell her: “aww, I’m sawwee.” Now go ahead and rehearse that a few times. There you go! Now you’re getting it!
4.  Remember: backbone = turnoff. Whatever you do on this date, Homie, do it curled up in the fetal position. Pro-tip: pop a thumb in your mouth and give it a hickey. Chances are good that she won’t be able to resist cradling you in her arms—these are her primal instincts—it’s the same reason she refers to herself as ‘Mommy’ when she’s talking to her dog. As you nuzzle into her, listen closely: if you hear her humming and wishing you a sleepy-go-night-night, you can start patting yourself on the back—she’s DTF, bro—guaranteed.
5.  Liken her to all the strong women in your life. Nothing gets the juices flowing like hearing some heart-warming anecdotes about your lesbian Aunt Trixie and her wild sense of abandon. Mega bonus: if the little lady has slathered herself with perfume, close your eyes, lift your nose and sniff. Then, unblinkingly and in your most delicate whisper, tell her it reminds you of that time you helped your Gram-Gram make her ‘extra-special’ pot-pourri.
6.  Profess an affinity for self-proclaimed ‘sluts.’ My Man: no modern woman wants to feel like you’re sizing her up for a long-lasting and meaningful relationship. That sort of thing went out the window along with chastity-belts and witch-dunking, Your Piousness. Assure this little filly that you intend to ghost as quickly as possible. Think about it: the last thing she needs in her life is some asshole junking-up her Netflix algorithm.
7.  Present her with a gift. Chocolate, flowers, jewellery—all fine and dandy (if you’re a chauvinist). If you really want to showcase your unrivalled sensitivity, have your ‘manhood’ prepared ahead of time by a professional taxidermist and wrap it all up in a fancy, red ribbon. She’ll appreciate the pluck. Pun intended.

Sex, glamour, danger, excitement and mystery are now relics of a bygone era. Hollywood is now solely focused on Woke, socially conscious, boring and sorrowful mediocre banal shit.
That’s okay though because now anyone can watch anything they want streamed on the net for free, either on a  movies123 , or a  putlockers  site from a server somewhere deep in China, or pay a small monthly fee to Netflix or Amazon. Hollywood is now irrelevant and the funny thing is, it brought all this upon itself by going Woke, and becoming some kind of Marxist tool for indoctrination that makes people switch off immediately.
The Oscars Cemetery
The Wokerati few all dolled up to the nines, sat around a few seats in a train station, a place where the trains coming and going would be infinitely more interesting than watching the pathetic luvvie champagne socialist scum trip over their frail egos.
This year it was a BLM festival Oscar ceremony where black actors were paraded in front of the cameras two to a dozen, all raising their fists in defiance of the white money men who financed their shit films that no one will watch or remember.
“I hate all white folk and hope you all die soon!” one black actor said in her acceptance speech to cheers from the assembled NPCs.
Many of the actors and actresses on parade on the night were unknown to many, and as they sashayed down the red carpet, in some households many probably had to do an internet search to find out who the fuck just made an acceptance speech. Of course, many probably did not bother to even do an internet search and just let it go.
“I doubt I would know who they were even with an internet search.”
On and on it went for over two hours, faceless, soulless, talentless, and with not an ounce of humour to spice things up a little.
Ricky Gervaise, even you would have a hard time coming up with material to say amongst the cadavers on display yesterday, and your non-invite was in fact a blessing. Hollywood is dead, and it seems so utterly bereft of life that even if one were to put a six-inch needle through the scrotal sac of Oscar himself, he would barely register a mild yelp."
Has Meghan Markle Turned Harry into a Do-Gooder Woke Fairy?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40273-has-meghan-markle-turned-harry-into-a-do-gooder-woke-fairy.html,2021,"Prince Harry used to be an action man, a hero to the British people, and a stalwart military figure mowing down Taliban by the dozen in an Apache helicopter, today, he is nothing but a shadow of his former self, an airy-fairy limp-wristed pussy with no bollocks, spouting do-gooder virtue signal clichés, sickly creepy Woke Marxist aphorisms by the vomit filled bucket load.
Abandoned Duty
What the fuck happened to Prince Harry?  Forget about shooting pheasants, Harry now is more at home with knitting a cardigan. How about watching the rugger at Twickers with the lads? Harry now prefers to read out some nonsense Woke pap Meghan wrote for him on their new Spotify podcast.
Harry has seemingly forgotten about Britain, a land now struggling under a Covid pandemic, and a people who genuinely enjoyed the antics of the former prince.
“Meghan Markle has brainwashed the prince. It is something that narcissist control freaks love to do, similar to cults, they isolate their mark, and eventually Harry was told to leave his own family and friends, country behind. It was all about the money, Meghan planned the move to the USA before the wedding, and forced Harry to leave everything behind, including his royal role, so she could use his status to make money. They claimed they left because of privacy issues, however that is clearly not the case exhibited by all the publicity opportunities in North America they have indulged in,” an analyst revealed on Sunday.
The emasculation of Harry is a very sad sight to watch, he has basically become a marginalised individual at the beck and call of a controlling woman who has changed him into a prancing fairy, and ultimately a laughingstock."

The only similarity between the two authors is they are both disgraced former members of the royal family.
“Meghan Markle’s new book is a delight, although there is something slightly wrong with it. Well, how can I say this. Ahem! It smells of poo! I suppose that’s why it is called ‘The Stench’,” prominent book critic, Barners Barnstorme, revealed in his weekly book review column.
In fact, ‘The Stench’ stinks so much some bookshops have elected to display the book in a hermetically sealed glass case so that prospective buyers are not put off too much. It gives off a horrible stench of betraying fatherhood, as Markle has treated her own father despicably, and has ruined Harry and Charles’ relationship completely.
Publisher, Sea Lion, were adamant that their money invested in Markle would eventually pay off, even though her book is a blatant rip off of this  one .
“We got this urgent call that Meghan was planning a  17th bathroom  for her Montecito McMansion, and she wanted to raise funds fast. Naturally, we obliged, it makes no sense to have less than 17 bathrooms in your mansion.

Instagram Influencer Posts Update Whilst Being Eaten by Shark,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42550-instagram-influencer-posts-update-whilst-being-eaten-by-shark.html,2021,"Josh Noah, 23, a prominent Instagram influencer with over 3 million subscribers, heroically managed to post an update to his account whilst being eaten alive by a  Great White shark  off the coast of Australia on Sunday.
Mr Noah then proceeded to post further updates to the account, including one where the shark took his remaining leg, and his right arm.
Luckily, he was holding his phone in his left-hand, so he could update his subscribers on his current status. His dedication to being an Instagram Influencer was truly unparalleled.
Eventually, the updates ended.
Australian coastguards trawled the area where the Instagram Influencer was last seen, however only recovered a half-eaten boogie board.
Coastguard chief, Alf Nolan, commended Mr Noah on his bravery.
“He was updating his Instagram right up to the end. Even when this poor bastard only had a left arm left, he was tapping away on that phone. We are currently looking for a 25 ft Great White shark which was witnessed stalking the shoreline by several people.”
Noah’s last tweet before the Great White shark ate the rest of him was in praise of his sponsor of the day, a fashion outlet selling swim shorts for men, inviting his subscribers to purchase some purple swim shorts for $34.99."
Leaky Harry: “I Did Not Leak Another Private Royal Conversation Again!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42637-leaky-harry-i-did-not-leak-another-private-royal-conversation-again.html,2021,"Former royal, Harry has defiantly dismissed the fact that he  leaked  another private royal conversation to the press again.
“I did not leak another private royal conversation to the press. No, it was not me! I was not there when I told my press people to spread it around. I am not here! I was not there! It was not me!” the former prince emphatically denied.
Now that it’s all over the media, somehow Harry’s words seem a bit weak.
“The former prince did not brief me to spread this private conversation to all news outlets far and wide. I have no knowledge of the former prince saying anything to me that related in any way to that private conversation regarding Prince Charles slimming down royalty and not making Archie a prince. No, I deny I heard those words being spluttered from Harry’s mouth,” the Archehole press secretary revealed to all news outlets on Sunday.
It is not known where all these conversations come from, because they seem to emanate from thin air.
Is Harry a  threat to national security ? Surely not."

The Vile Protestations of Innocence From an Entitled Black Actor,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41990-the-vile-protestations-of-innocence-from-an-entitled-black-actor.html,2021,"There’s no smoke without fire, and when 20+ women come out concerning  sexual abuse  from a protected black actor, the race card is the only defence from the likes of scum like actor Noel Clarke. Once celebrated by the Wokerati champagne socialist luvvie club, now a pariah with only a dodgy tattered race card to play in his defence.
“Black actors in showbiz were given a free pass, doors were opened for them, and some of them abused their positions. Pieces of shit like Clarke are only too prevalent, and this is the price people pay for letting animals like this to run wild,” an undisclosed film worker revealed.
No doubt putrid detritus like Clarke will be fully reprieved for his alleged abuses on young women by the media and champagne socialist actors’ equity card holders.
In YouTube-land another black celebrity has been caught out, this time a grossly obese black man calling himself EDB445 (Eat Dat Pussy 445) who was caught out arranging to meet a 13-year-old white girl, even sending pictures of his shit to what he thought was easy prey. Turned out that the 13-year-old girl was actually a paedophile hunting group, and the meeting was filmed in 4k. Naturally, YouTube defended the child predator because if you’re black you are now a protected individual whatever crimes you commit.
There is one rule for black people now, and a rule for the rest. Protected in every way, given vast privileges over everyone else, and allowed to commit as many crimes as they want without prosecution or reprisal. This is not ‘equality’ but supremacy."
Magnificent Meghan Markle Gets Ready For Pregnancy in Home Gym,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41146-magnificent-meghan-markle-gets-ready-for-pregnancy-in-home-gym.html,2021,"Every man will get sweaty after they see the wonderful sight of Meghan Markle getting ready in her home gym for her  pregnancy  in seven months time.
She performs a perfect split on the floor, then proceeds to do 10 press-ups with little or no effort. Harry is a lucky guy to have such a supple wife.
Dressed in a figure hugging leotard Meghan displays her figure for the cameras with ease, as the Hello magazine featurette will also go to pay for a small portion of the running costs of the massive Montecito estate.
Meghan then bends over abruptly and lets off a little fanny fart, it squeaks of tightness down there, and the cameraman flinches as he sniffs a hint of burrito and refried beans.
Showing off her svelte figure even in the throes of pregnancy, Meghan is a photographer’s delight, and exudes a certain energy that cannot be replicated by others.
“Here’s one for the Queen!” Meghan yells as she lifts a weight but finds it too heavy dropping the bulky object on her toe.
“Yow!” oh dear, it’s off to the changing rooms with you young lady. You need to nurse that sore toe, which one you ask, well you decide?"
First Transgender Woman Crowned Miss Minnesota 2021,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41208-first-transgender-woman-crowned-miss-minnesota-2021.html,2021,"Hailing from the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota, Shaquashisha LaQwandwell, 23, the state’s first ever transgender woman, was crowned Miss Minnesota in St. Paul on Monday.
This year’s Minnesota beauty pageant was an all-inclusive affair, with not only transgender women invited but even paraplegic women were duly encouraged to join.
Under Joe Biden’s new transgender directives, if you are a transgender biological male, you are welcome to join not only the military but any sport for women, or beauty pageant.
Accepting her prize LaQwandwell was naturally happy to win such a prestigious contest, and is now pushing her sights to enter Miss USA, and even the Miss Universe contest.
“Imma aks y’all do you lakk ma beautiful face and figure ni**az, cuz y’all bitchez gonna see me sashay in to Miss USA soon. Imma gon enter Miss USA, not wit ma 15 inch but da contest silly. Gotcha dere!”
At one point, LaQwandwell dropped her flowers and bent over to pick them up giving the judges all a solid eyeful of her meat and two veg, but that was neither here nor there, she has every right as any woman to join the contest. Bigotry and discrimination will not be tolerated."
What Happens When the Masses Stop Enjoying Filming Themselves?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41256-what-happens-when-the-masses-stop-enjoying-filming-themselves.html,2021,"The masses were given their toys to amuse themselves a few decades ago, amongst the encouragement of grotesque narcissistic indulgence in taking selfies of themselves every 30 seconds, there were the YouTube videos where the masses were given their 15 minutes of fame as Warhol prescribed all those years ago.
What are you going to do after you’ve taken the 100,000th selfie of your face? Which one is the best shot, as you review each one on your hard disk for hours and hours.
What happens however when the masses get bored of filming themselves constantly doing banal tasks? Will this sense of existential ennui cause a major fault line in the system?
By keeping the masses amused at all times is a form of control that serves the controllers very well. Not only are the masses engrossed in their inane pursuits given to deserving ridicule from their Masters, but their conditioned actions also engenders a false sense of importance to the controlled population. You are important because you get 5 million views on your YouTube video of you peeling potatoes, or that photo of a salad on Instagram has over 10 million comments.
Women holding mobile phones to their bodies, their faces, brings out a collective mass euphoria flooding the overall trench of sickening narcissistic deceit and lies prevalent on social media. Of course in today’s society to see women taking pictures of themselves every few minutes, and posting it on some social media site is perfectly acceptable behaviour, however when men do it, there is a certain revulsion as the preening men exude a trait that used to be reserved for the forever camp in the past. Again, today it is perfectly accepted within society for men to be emasculated prima donnas prancing around taking pictures of themselves every five minutes.
It could, however, get rather dangerous if the masses wake up to their conditioning, and the social experiment is exposed. This is why the controlling bodies need to keep inventing new ways to humiliate the masses by constantly giving them new toys to play with.
For the aware, to watch all these people doing these things they do on social media, and everywhere on the internet is truly embarrassing to humanity, and it is also extremely sad to watch such levels of degradation being celebrated by morons who effectively have no control of their minds or bodies.
It’s okay, go and take another pouting photo of yourself, and add it to the thousands already on social media. Go on, you cannot control yourself, you have to do it, and in another five to ten minutes you will repeat the same process, along with checking how many people commented on the photo of yourself resulting in a little endorphin rush, it’s not at the same level as the first photo you ever posted of yourself, but there is still a little there to sate your little mind."
Fleeting Fame of British Celebrities Exposed,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41520-fleeting-fame-of-british-celebrities-exposed.html,2021,"There’s something about D-list British celebrities that’s well below standard, and if one remembers the 90s with  Eastenders  starlets like Daniella Westbrook and Brian Harvey of the sickly boy band  East17,  their banal cockney stardom was a rite of passage for the common folk who aspired to be lifted from the grime of anonymity.
Embrace the wonder and power of drugs when you look at Daniella Westbrook’s face today in 2021, her skin ravaged by years of cocaine abuse, her nose practically hanging off the destroyed cartilage, she is a stark contrast to the youthful beauty she exuded, she has been through the mincemeat machine more than once, a testament to the excesses of Uncle Charlie. One could postulate that Keith Richards looks better than her, even though he has probably done more drugs than any other soul in the rock’n’roll firmament, and he’s still fucking standing loud and proud. To compare a D-list soap opera actress and one of the greatest rock’n’rollers to ever live is a moot point, talent and career wise, but in the context of looks, there is a certain validity to it.
Brian Harvey, on the other hand is the same ilk as Daniella Westbrook, and he was shamefully a member of some erroneous boy band some decades ago, and is a lesson in the Music Biz’s Mephistophelian ways. How fleeting fame is to many, exploited by evil pedo scum managers these idiots thought they made it, they were sold the dream, yet are now penniless. Harvey now lives in a mid-terraced property in some shit hole part of London, there are no private jets or long winding driveways.  East17  are the epitome of Music Biz nightmares, performing monkeys with egos the size of skyscrapers fuelled by cheap low-quality drugs that have absolutely nothing to show for their putrid performances — absolutely nothing.
Fame is indeed a fleeting moment for many, one only has to peruse the right side of the Daily Mail front page on the web, to wonder who these people all are? Each week a new crop unveils itself, how much did they pay their PR people to get to that innocuous and irrelevant level of existence, these people have no discernable distinguishing features they all look and act the same. It is very hard to even remember their names, and they’re supposed to be ‘famous’ celebrities. All these disgusting vile narcissists vying for that little bit of attention from an increasingly jaded and terminally bored public.
This is why Harvey and Westbrook are the poster children for the morbid death of British celebrity-hood, the devil wrote them up a contract, and they squandered the opportunity, but that’s not the devil’s problem – it never is – he’s still going to collect even if the deal was completed or not.
Choke on your cocaine you gluttonous untalented pukes, look at Daniella Westbrook’s repellant face today and for one second in your mind imagine how beautiful she used to once be, if that ain’t the devil talking through a crack pipe, then what is?
Alternatively you can watch a Brian Harvey rant on YouTube where he is visibly having a complete paranoid drugged up schizoid break down in front of his subscribers.
Whatever the case, there is no rhyme or reason to the way things worked out for these two examples, it just is what it is, and to watch their slow car crash online is somehow liberating, because at the time of their heyday, you knew they were shite and part of a sick celebrity circus of banality, and years after the fact, the proof is in the pudding, to add another cliché to the proceedings. Nothing is nothing in the end, and if you have nothing, nothing will come of you in the end."
Dumbo Harry: “I am Not Living in a Fantasy Land”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42684-dumbo-harry-i-am-not-living-in-a-fantasy-land.html,2021,"Earl of Dumbo, former prince, Harry, may now be just another celebrity, but he has emphatically denied living in a fantasy world.
“When I spoke to Doprah I told the  whole truth  and nothing but the truth. My dad cut me off completely of financial aid when I left Britain. He was only paying my £5 million when I was used to receiving £10 million a month. That’s not good enough for me or Meghan, and she had a huge hissy fit over it. Meghan told me to shame papa on the Doprah show whilst we plied the show with more lies…ahem…I mean truths! Money grows on trees, right?”
Amongst the many lies and half-truths spilled on the Doprah interview, were the usual crap about Archie being denied princedom for some reason or rather, being married twice, and other petty grievances that people who do not receive vast sums of money for doing nothing could not comprehend.
What does prince Harry and Meghan do exactly apart from expel vast sums of carbon emissions every year with their extensive private jet travel itinerary and other emission busting nonsense? If living in an extensive 16-bathroom McMansion is not enough of an insult, what the fuck is?
Being the self-proclaimed saviours of the earth with their constant nonsensical lectures is obviously not enough.
What happened to their Spotify show that was meant to change global consciousness?
As for the awful saccharin puerile illiterate  book  written by Meghan, insider publisher knowledge reveals that the book was in fact purchased in its thousands by Meghan Markle’s team, so it would top the New York bestseller list. That’s the only way it could get to that level, simply because no sane person on the planet would buy that book if they possessed a single brain cell.
One has to feel awfully sorry for Harry though, he does not know whether he’s coming or going, he has a form of verbal diarrhoea with no plug in sight, much to the detriment of anyone exposed to the media, or the long-suffering royal family.
How much money was pumped into the life of Harry over the years, how much taxpayers cash was pissed away in Mahiki and places like Las Vegas?
Harry may be an ungrateful parasite who constantly wants more cash and fame for his greed-driven ego, but there may come a day when even the real Lilibet has enough of this uncouth narcissistic creature of low intelligence."
Another Chapter in Evil : Soviet Censorship of Dr Seuss,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41217-another-chapter-in-evil-soviet-censorship-of-dr-seuss.html,2021,"Soviet Marxism and its totalitarian evil is upon us once more, and this time the much-loved childhood books of Dr. Seuss have come under the  cancel culture  hammer.
It does not matter if an image today or piece of literature is perceived as ‘racist’ today, it is a record of humanity in all its forms, and a record of history that should be preserved in all its glory. If history is erased, however nasty it is perceived in the future, then humanity cannot see how it evolved in thought and perception. Deleting history dooms humanity to keep repeating questionable parts of history over, and over again.
Where this hammer and sickle fall every month is another sign that Western democracy and the tenet of basic freedom of expression puts its foot one step closer to the grave.
The despicable demented pieces of cat piss who have brought themselves to cancel some of the Dr. Seuss books, are vile merchants of the enzootic soviet creep that is converging on all Western history, literature, art and science.
What are these savage cannibalistic brutes going to do next, and who gives them so much power as to even think they can cancel things?
These pinko motherfucker commie bastards should all be lined up and served their marching orders, because they’re in the system somewhere, they are being enabled by someone, and they are even being paid vast amounts of money to damage Western culture.
This is their Reichstag fire, this is their Stalinist book burning ceremony of hatred and intolerance.
The irony of the situation of course is that the people who claim to be ‘liberal’ and tolerant are the ones burning books this time, they claim to fight ‘hate speech’ with hatred and intolerance.
The worst part of the carnage of literature, art, science, history and freedom of speech being cancelled is the silence. Where is the outrage? Where are the professors, the publishers and the academic faculties, where are the political leaders, where are the policy and lawmakers?
Nowhere."
Psychiatrist: “Harry is Projecting His Mental Illness onto Audience and Father”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42173-psychiatrist-harry-is-projecting-his-mental-illness-onto-audience-and-father.html,2021,"Dr. Hubert Wilkins, a prominent psychiatrist from the Wilhelm Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, was asked to analyse the recent public outbursts of former British royal, Harry.
“Analysing the recent outburst of Harry, it is safe to state that the former prince is projecting his own mental illness and internal denial mechanisms onto others, namely his father Prince Charles, his grandmother and deceased grandfather. What we define as projection are the elements of thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one’s own which are consolidated by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else. All projections elicit counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject. Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual representational enactment.
“During his latest outburst Harry is quoted as saying: ‘There’s no blame. But certainly when it comes to parenting, if I have experienced some kind of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father, or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle, so I don’t pass it on.’ He starts off with the words ‘There’s no blame’ but goes on to blame his father and other royals immediately after that statement. Harry also states that the ‘pain’ he attributes to others should not be transferred to his own children, however what he is doing by publicly speaking about his mental pain is actually going to affect his children in the future when they can read. Rather hypocritically, he is actually doing what he just blamed on his own father and grandparents, but in a worse manner, to millions of listeners worldwide. One can only conclude that his motivation is not as he states, in protecting his children, but of sheer vengeance, and narcissistic retaliation projected upon his relatives.
“Harry is most certainly a person with a split narcissistic schizoid personality, as the evidence presents itself. Whatsmore, projection is more commonly found in narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. Harry does display elements of schizophrenic psychosis, which does come to explain some of the dualistic personality traits he seems to exhibit.
“Harry’s mental illness is however treatable and manageable. He states that he is getting help for his various psychiatric disorders, possibly through extensive therapy and drug treatment. I would go further to suggest that Harry should be chaperoned by medically trained staff on a daily basis, as a means to not only protect himself, but others he comes into contact with. Furthermore, outbursts on radio programmes and television only damage Harry’s already fragile mental state, and he should not display his mental illness as a badge of honour just to be vindictive to others with his projection, or to gain sympathy for his narcissism.”"
Meghan Markle Says She Will Only Come Back to UK If She Can Sit on Throne,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41411-meghan-markle-says-she-will-only-come-back-to-uk-if-she-can-sit-on-throne.html,2021,"Meghan Markle has spoken out about returning to the UK, but only if she can sit on the Queen’s throne every day.
Speaking through her spokeswoman, Ovid Scoobie, Meghan Markle made the demands which were then relayed to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.
The Queen and her consorts were once again blindsided by the incredible demands from the ‘pushy’ Duchess.
Royal courtiers were scrambling to digest the precise demands which were delivered on a long list.
“It says here that certain macrobiotic foods would have to be delivered every day via air freight from California to the UK to sate Markle’s trendy habits. Markle also demanded her own quarters at Buckingham Palace as well as at Windsor. The throne room would be designated a Meghan Markle zone where she would arrange photo shoots and use the throne to dictate her socialist agenda to the world as well as entertain her Californian friends,” one courtier revealed.
Her Majesty was told about the demands earlier on today, and was said to have turned a deep shade of beetroot.
No mention of Harry was made at any time by Markle or her ‘friends’."
Experts: Meghan Markle Thought She Could Move Up Rank in Royal Family,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41634-experts-meghan-markle-thought-she-could-move-up-rank-in-royal-family.html,2021,"According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works.
“Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that’s it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point.
“This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums.
“Prince Harry once said ‘What Meghan wants Meghan gets’ and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry’s life by taking him away from the royal family to North America.
“Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle’s psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go.
“Markle has  modelled herself on Harry’s mother, Diana , and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the  Shanghai Technique ,  so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique.
“Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana’s inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work.
“Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves.
“As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan’s evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan’s titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.”"

Archewell Audio is currently dropping like a brick at 142 in the Spotify charts.
“I’d rather drill my ear holes with a fucking rusty fork than listen to some parasite privileged spoiled brat former royals telling me what to feel and how to act. Fuck you from the bottom of my rectal gaseous exchange,” one Spotify listener revealed.
Harry and Meghan’s failure to indoctrinate the Spotify listeners is quite endearing because  Archewell Audio  is now at 142 in the charts, below even a podcast about Cults at 138. The wonderfully titled  The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz  is two points higher at 140.
One can almost imagine the voice of Keith Chegwin (RIP) on Top of the Pops relaying the vast fall from the charts, but to the credit of TOTP they only counted the top 20.

Monthly Low IQ Report,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40994-monthly-low-iq-report.html,2021,"Hi Squibbers, this month we have some low IQ gems that truly exemplify the drastic fall in intelligence levels in recent times.
Exhibit A – Gorilla Glue Girl
This wonderful specimen does not hail from the rainforests of the Congo, but from Louisiana, USA. For a start, real gorillas have considerably higher IQs.
Tessica Brown ran out of hairspray, but had a bottle of  Gorilla Glue  handy. She sprayed her hair with the strong adhesive that should only be used to repair objects like furniture. Naturally, her hair became  rock solid on her scalp , and a visit to ER did nothing as bemused medics had never seen such stupidity in their lives.
It is estimated that Tessica Brown’s IQ level is with all probability around the 38 level, and that’s being generous. Her IQ level is thus below someone with a major brain disorder or injury, and she is even below the level of major retardation.
Exhibit B – YouTuber Shot Dead After Confronting Stranger With Butcher Knives
Some people will do anything for YouTube views, don’t forget to click the fucking subscribe and notification button. Timothy Wilks, 20, was gunned down in the parking lot of Urban Air trampoline park in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday.
Wilks was filming a robbery prank for a YouTube channel at the time.
He is reported to have lunged at strangers with butcher’s knives, so he could record their terrified reactions.
This time, there was no ‘like’ button pressed, but a trigger pulled and a lead bullet entered his tiny cranium.
It is estimated that much like other YouTube ‘personalities’ Wilks’ IQ level was probably in the lower 50s. More borderline retardation, but the good news is he will not pass his genes on as he did not procreate.
We can only afford a small snapshot into the current lack of intelligence malaise, as we fear this article would be never ending if we included every monthly incident of gross stupidity. See you randomly from one month to the next or whenever."

The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle’s black couture dress.
They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry’s ratings in the UK.
One of Oprah’s producers was professional about the bird shit incident.
“The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!”
As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple’s garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient.

Queen Meghan and King Harry of America Knight Their Gardener,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/39995-queen-meghan-and-king-harry-of-america-knight-their-gardener.html,2020,"A merican royal author appointed by Queen Meghan and King Harry, Ringo Scoobie, has outlined in a new book that the American royal couple have knighted their first Sir on American soil.
According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea.
“The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace’s footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like ‘puta’ and ‘madre’.
“Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword.
“The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers ‘Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the  Archehole Foundation  and Netflix.’ The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away.
“The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day’s business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.”
It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future.
In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder.
Queen Meghan has staunchly denied the American royals are competing with anyone else, ahem, mention no names."
Fountain of Youth: Meghan Bathes in Asses Milk Daily Say Servants,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/32789-fountain-of-youth-meghan-bathes-in-asses-milk-daily-say-servants.html,2019,"Possibly channelling Cleopatra, but not quite Countess Elizabeth Bathory, the copper bath in Frogmore castle is already getting its usage quota. The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle does not look a day older than her 47 years on this earth.
“Me lady bathes in asses milk every day between the hours of 8 and 10 in the morning. It is supposed to keep her young and beautiful. The milk is siphoned from the teats of virgin donkeys from a nearby farm in the Windsor estate,” the servant revealed.
It is not scientifically proven if  bathing in asses milk  is good for maintaining one’s youthful looks, but if Meghan Markle does it, then it must be.
The Daily Mail is already running articles targeting women on where to buy the best donkey milk and how to acquire a copper bath. The frenzy is all too apparent as many ladies across the nation are now rushing everywhere searching for asses milk to bathe in.
“It’s not something you can just buy in Tesco. When I heard Meghan does it, I bought a bunch of donkeys specifically to milk them every day. We keep them in the garage which is now an impromptu stable,” Gloria Hunnisapple, 58, from Braintree, Essex reveals in another tabloid.
Asses milk does not come cheap, and the estimated cost to the British taxpayer just for Meghan’s morning beauty regime is estimated to be approximately £8.6 million per annum.
Wherever she is, Meghan has to have fresh asses milk for her daily bathing session, or she gets extremely angry and has an  assy  fit.
Naturally, Prince Harry, the real ass in this whole sorry tale, now lives in a separate wing of the cottage and has no say in the matter."
Royal Experts: Thomas Markle Could Spill Beans About Meghan’s Other Children,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/33601-royal-experts-thomas-markle-could-spill-beans-about-meghans-other-children.html,2019,"With news that twice-married Meghan Markle has made the  decision  to remain estranged from Thomas Markle, 75, ‘to protect herself, her husband and her son’, royal experts believe the real reason is that Meghan’s father knows too much about her sordid past.
“It would certainly be unbecoming to have her father attend a royal function and to blab about what Meghan got up to in the past. The royal family did not vet this woman before she sank her claws into poor prince Harry, who is not clever enough or experienced to realise what he was getting into,” Jane Fredericks, a royal commentator revealed.
“He could ruin her deception”
During an interview with someone from Meghan’s past, the woman who used to be Meghan’s boss at an upmarket golf course when she worked as a caddy, revealed that Meghan has another child. This revelation would mean that Meghan lied not only to prince Harry about her past, but also the royal family before she married the prince. It also means newborn Archie has a brother or sister somewhere in America.
Thomas Markle, who has now been totally cut off from ever seeing his grandchild could elect to still blab to the press, which would no doubt add to the acrimony, however, what has he got to lose now?
Nothing."

Bankrupt Former Celebrity Katie Price Reduced to £20 Jobs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34777-bankrupt-former-celebrity-katie-price-reduced-to-20-jobs.html,2019,"After squandering her  £45 million  fortune on useless trinkets, pink vehicles and plastic surgery, the former model has fallen on hard times.
The defiant former model now lives in a cardboard box made up of her novels, which were written by a ghost writer, because Price can neither read or write.
In a recent Sun exclusive, reporters visited the down-and-out under Waterloo Bridge where she sleeps and peddles her trade by night.
“Ahm still livin’ it large. This is all a test for me innit. I fink to myself I can get on my pony and ride to the Sath of France to get on a yacht to America to re-make my fortune again innit.”
Katie Price proudly points to the top of her cardboard box lined with her bestselling novels all now found in bargain buckets across the country and pound shops.
“Dis was my fave, I like da picture on it, you’se can see how big my fake breasts were at the time.”
After creditors cleared most of her debts, Ms Price had all of 34 pence in her bank account, but she still owes £13 million which she plans to pay back by doing what she does best.
“Ah na do releef for tramps innit and anyone who comes along. It’s twenty quid per service, and if you let go in my mauff it’s an extra tenner. I love it, it’s the greatest gig in the world, and ma punters always come back maybe give me a black eye or somink, but I can fight back I’m a hard woman innit, I can boot a man across the room no probs! Ahm a femininist..innit.”
After her veneered teeth fell out two months ago because she could not pay the dentist, Katie Price is now without teeth, and gummy. Funnily enough, this makes her an even bigger hit with her clients.
“Afta I lotht ma teef ah thot it would be a naghtmare. I soon fand at th’ punters love me gummie gums innit. No nasty toothy scrapes..innit….na wat amin?” (winks)
Working out of a dimly lit room in the Soho district, Katie has to compete with the Eastern European girls and has even learned how to speak Romanian.
Quite the singer, Katie likes to also serenade prospective clients with choruses from the film Lion King.
Here’s to a bright future for the former celebrity who is actually enjoying her time out of the limelight."

Unfortunately for the Lib Dem, Jo Swinson, who seemed to shun democracy, when the democratic people spoke, she was summarily dumped in the garbage shoot of political irrelevance, a place where she truly deserved to inhabit.
You see, the people can see a bad egg a mile off, and here was one hell of a smelly egg, who was billing to revoke Article 50 and the vote of 17.4 million voters into the mire.
Goodbye Veruca Swinson, your big wide mouth may be useful in some quarters, as you demanded to become Prime Minister Swinson, but justice and karma has a way of catching up.
Down she goes, into the smelly rubbish shoot, or in other words the House of Lords? Surely not?

New Tarantino Film Featuring Charles Manson Inspired By Ocasio-Cortez,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/31615-new-tarantino-film-featuring-charles-manson-inspired-by-ocasio-cortez.html,2019,"The ninth film from genius director, Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is set to be a real corker.
Tarantino explained in an interview recently about how daily life, and regular TV inspired him to write the new script.
“What makes me sit down to start writing is a genre that I’m interested in tackling. I was watching CNN – Boom! I see these crazy fucking eyes staring at me, and I immediately went to this book about the Tate murders. This fucking chick blabbing about a Green Deal or something, Ocasio-Cortez, she had the same look man, Charlie Manson, I could’ve swallowed a Royale with cheese right there and then, but go slow on the fuckin’ mayo! Once I started researching, I exploded the borders of the genre. DiCaprio, he’s my new Keitel. You know cultural points of fucking reference man – slap in some vintage cars, some nostalgia, some references to popular shit that went on back in the day when Hollywood was oozing with creativity, but I gotta mix it in with drugs, sick violence, and cheesy music that’ll come out in a box set in a few years in a bargain bucket. So even though it is a movie about the 60s Hollywood scene, it’s a lot more. But that’s my process. The film has multiple storylines, a mosaic of characters, some who meet each other, some who never meet, or some who meet in a different dimension. I don’t think it ever derails the train, it just makes the train ride a little more fun. I pride myself, when it comes to tone, on being able to turn on a dime. I can create a suspenseful thing, then break it with a joke, maybe add in some gratuitous violence, then top it off with the hero walking into the sunset along to surf guitar music. Then one more line and you’re back on a suspense tip! Fin! Credits roll with my special font I chose after many hours!”"
Why Getting a Lobotomy is the Latest Celebrity Craze,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/31232-why-getting-a-lobotomy-is-the-latest-celebrity-craze.html,2019,"What have Justin Bieber, David Beckham and Heather Locklear got in common?
They have all had lobotomies, and it’s the latest celebrity fad that is taking celebrities to a much better, more manageable place in Hollywood and the entertainment business.
“They’ve had all the tattoos, in fact tattoos are out now. I was acquisitioned by Justin Bieber to conduct a lobotomy on his brain. After a psychological evaluation, I agreed,” brain surgeon and neurologist, Dr. Helmut Jensen, told the LA Times.
Lobotomies don’t come cheap, it is estimated that Bieber’s procedure cost about $38,000 but the results of the operation are amazing.
The simple process involves severing connections in the brain’s prefrontal cortex. Most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain are severed giving peace of mind to the recipient.
Why are celebrities all getting a lobotomy?
“Many celebrities like Bieber, Beckham and others have very low IQs, and the amount of problems life deals out every day can overwhelm their simple minds. Like they watch the news and are completely confused and affected by what is going on, this is why they have a lobotomy so they don’t have to think about anything anymore. They can now just perform their songs or do modelling without having to think about lofty thoughts which only causes anxiety and stress,” consultant neurologist and behaviorology expert, Angela Tanner M.D. revealed.
The Kardashians have all been lobotomised, and there is very little difference to their brains before and after. The biggest celebrity recipient so far is Kanye West, who now sits in a corner of a recording studio with a MAGA hat on his head mumbling inane nonsense, absolutely no change there from before his lobotomy.
Fashion changes at quite a fast pace in celebrity land, so tattoos are now being hidden or erased. The real magic is now in the mind, where celebrities are completely erasing their thoughts, for peace of mind.
Justin Bieber, who had an IQ of 26 before his lobotomy now has an IQ of 4. This drastic change means that he does not have to get confused anymore, it is a form of relief for him, and he simply performs on stage miming as usual, then once off the stage he is very manageable.
“We just put him in the corner facing the wall in the dressing room after his performance. Not a flicker, he sits there content for hours until it is time to move him to his hotel room where he is put to bed, and the process repeated the next day,” Bieber’s manager, Alonso DuMas, told Entertainment Weekly.
Because of the latest celebrity craze, many other people are getting lobotomies as they follow their role models without question."
Studying the Phenomenon of Banal Narcissistic Selfie Addicts Falling Off Cliffs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/30977-studying-the-phenomenon-of-banal-narcissistic-selfie-addicts-falling-off-cliffs.html,2019,"We now live in an age where narcissism and self love are encouraged to such a level that many people are putting their lives at risk to get that perfect selfie.
Whether it is atop a radio tower, or on the edge of a cliff, or on a train track, these people will do anything for their selfish need for likes on social media.
Analysing these people is not exactly a hard task, they are fucking narcissistic selfish schizoid pieces of shit addicted to the little serotonin hit they get every time some other equally brainless twat presses a ‘like’ for whatever image they put up about themselves.
Reading the news reports of many of these people dying to pursue their selfish narcissistic false dreams of glamour and internet celeb status is frankly a huge relief. It is quite true to say that we want more of these selfie people to fall off the edge of a cliff to be smashed into a gooey crunchy mess on the rocks below. It is most probably a relief not only for poor old battered planet earth, where these vile creatures take up unnecessary air molecules by breathing in the air, but for the internet itself, because there may be less of these talentless pustules popping up in the middle of your daily surf session.
Let us encourage more of these people to take their deadly selfies, make it a religion, where they meet their almighty selfie god in the annals of internet selfie stardom, their brains dashed against the hard concrete of eternal false pseudo-celebrity shame.
The smartphone companies and social media conglomerates must increase their fervour in enticing these morons to become more daring; maybe take a selfie just before a great white shark bites them in half whilst snorkeling near the Great Barrier Reef, or how about jumping into a lion enclosure just before feeding time at the zoo, for that very special gut spewing selfie?
We want more selfies, more daring stunts, maybe the dangerous escapades of these idiotic buffoons could reduce the depletion of the ozone layer, or better still stop the ice caps melting.
Has the human race come to such a pitiful level that people are killing themselves to get the best shot of their face to digitally publish it on some inconsequential digital platform made up of ones and zeros where other pitiful people press a button to like their picture? If this is the case, then all philosophy, science, literature and music of the past is now deemed useless because culture and society has been reduced to the lowest form of human existence by these selfie people.
Amongst the illiterate selfie addicts, the inability of the human race to focus for more than five seconds on any given subject, is a testament to negative social engineering, where the minds of many humans today have been literally turned to mush, to jelly, bereft of any brain cells. This is the future, and this is the reality, a generation of humans completely unable to process anything other than their fucking selfish selfies.
We want more of you, armies of selfie takers, growing daily, engineered for a short useless life, to be quickly forgotten when the new system of internet does not recognise the former’s syntax.
One must hand it to our digital overlords however authoritarian they are, at least they found a humorous way of ridding the world of the chaff, the useless eaters, the narcissistic selfish people, lemmings all following each other over the cliff, smartphones in hand. Adieu, farewell, into the pit you all go, one after the other, from nothingness, into supreme nothingness, the long sleep where time stands still and the only image they see is the eternal picture of their face just before they hit the ground.
Yes I’m beautiful, yes I’m beautiful, yes I’m…..Aaaaaargh..(splat!)"
TV Producers: ‘Love Island’ to be Renamed ‘Death Island’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/31513-tv-producers-love-island-to-be-renamed-death-island.html,2019,"What happens when you put a bunch of narcissistic, low IQ, money and quick fame hungry parasites onto a ‘love island’ where these miscreants are forced to couple for the entertainment of others?
Inevitably, the whole tragedy of reality TV ends in death sooner or later, whether we are referencing cultural death, death of dignity, or actual death is not the point, death is something that all who participate in these types of shows embrace wholeheartedly.
“To call the show ‘love island’ is contradictory to the word ‘love’. There is no romantic love in the money-grabbing fame hungry shallow group of low IQ meatheads and slappers. This show is the exact opposite of love, and is more in tune with cheap, vulgar, tasteless displays of banal as muck useless eaters parading their narcissistic personalities and bodies in front of TV audiences that are no better. To watch this crude inglorious squalid degrading type of show is a pollutant that damages society deeply, and murders culture leaving a vile residue of diarrhea festering vomit and the stench of rotting corpses, bloated and black carrion flesh replete with a multitude of bluebottle flies ready to lay their eggs into the grey meat of death itself,” an ITV commissioning executive revealed himself, before realising the ultimate truth of what he had unleashed, thus committing suicide and clearing his account on humanity.
‘Death Island’ as the show will now be me more appropriately known will be more truthful to the image it portrays.
“To have some dumb Essex greasy haired single-brain-celled twat who has never read a book in his life, or even acknowledged anything else apart from his shallow obsession with his six pack, fake tan, and shitty tattoos commit Seppuku plunging a wakizashi deep into his abdomen slicing horizontally whilst the waiting kaishakunin finishes the ritual by observing the dakikubi technique leaving a little sliver of skin to embrace the head, would bring some form of honour and justice to the mere existence of this person on this earth and the TV show. Death Island would thus be a show where reality actually happened,” another ITV executive who had repented from his crimes against society and culture, revealed."
How Long Will the Meghan and Harry Marriage Last?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34212-how-long-will-the-meghan-and-harry-marriage-last.html,2019,"It’s not easy marrying into British royalty, especially if you are not British, and you are an American actress with strong views about certain issues.
This is where Meghan Markle has fallen into a traditional royal British institution steeped in history that cannot be changed, yet Meghan is trying to change the Monarchy which is stringent in following the rules of royal congress.
Essentially, the odds are against Meghan in many ways, and it is highly unlikely she will survive the slings and arrows of outrageous royal fortune. Put your bets on now on matchbook for the odds are in favour of a divorce within the next four years.
Here is an American minor actress, who comes from a truly  broken dysfunctional family , marrying into a royal family that some say are just as dysfunctional on the inside yet outwardly functional for the sake of the Crown and the press.
The media has been merciless in ripping apart Meghan and Harry at every opportunity, and this has not helped their weak fragile marriage at all, simply because they have tried to play the media but it has backfired grotesquely.
The recent  PR offensive in Africa  was meant to show the couple playing around with little African children to prove how loving they are, however the trip was marred by Harry bringing up the ghosts of the past and a pity party ITV interview.
Can Hollywood and British royalty mix successfully? Only if there is respect for the traditions of royalty and only a light smattering of celebrity culture. If the celebrity side does supersede the other, then there will only be more trouble, as Meghan and Harry are finding out the hard way.
Meghan also has been accused of trying to portray herself as a new Diana figure, however her portrayal has gone awry, and actually backfired in PR terms. Prince Harry, does have a weakness, and this is what Meghan has latched on, but is it right to exploit the prince on the loss of his mother?
Staunch institutions like the British royal family are so entrenched in tradition, that to mess with their equilibrium is highly dangerous.
Writing affirmations on everything and preaching to the crowd whilst being a hypocrite are not things that should be done by a royal, yet Meghan and Harry are guilty of mass hypocrisy and proselytizing to the masses. The damage has already been done, the question is, can it be repaired?"

Opening up further to Western influences, Japanese ads in the 1980s often featured Hollywood celebrities making a quick buck in the land of the Rising Sun. Looks like Arnie paid for over half his income by appearing in Jap ads in the 80s.

Samantha Markle Hires Voodoo Priestess For Meghan,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/31380-samantha-markle-hires-voodoo-priestess-for-meghan.html,2019,"Estranged half-sister of Meghan Markle, Samantha Markle, has hired a voodoo priestess to get back at the royals and their treatment of her dad as well as her half-sister, the now Duchess of Sussex.
On Saturday, she travelled to Port-au-Prince in Haiti to find what is called a Mambo.
“Samantha was seen at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in her wheelchair and a pack of photographers from the National Enquirer in tow,” local press reported.
According to experts in the voodoo religion, the Mambo will conduct intricate rituals which may also require blood sacrifice to please the Vodou gods who will carry out the dastardly deeds prescribed by Samantha Markle.
“It has gotten to this level of hate that Samantha displays in her daily broadcasts to the tabloid newspapers that she has now resorted to crazy methods to get back at her ‘lying’ half-sister,” a close friend commentated on the whole sorry affair."
Fans Celebrate the Amazing Reality That Pete Doherty is Still Alive,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34424-fans-celebrate-the-amazing-reality-that-pete-doherty-is-still-alive.html,2019,"Fans of the modern libertine, Pete Doherty are frankly quite amazed and astounded that their hero, Pete Doherty is still alive.
“Yah, it’s totally amazing! He’s probably done more heroin and Charlie than Keef, and been chucked in prison more times than I can remember, plus he lives a squalid lifestyle that would make a tramp envious,” one fan quipped at a memorial service to another year lived by Doherty.
To define Doherty as a rock star is probably too ambitious, he is more well described as a fucked up NME pop starlet, as his songs do not have an ounce of ballsy rock in them, but are more akin to the jarring jangly tuneless emanations of a cat mewling in pain after it has been partially run over by a car.
Doherty’s chosen abode has become the sleazy environs of some Bohemian Parisian district where he delights the French with his bad poetry and entertains the crowds by squirting his rancid blood across the walls of his wrecked rented bijoux apartment whilst stabbing another overused vein.
Parisian fashion designers view the urine and vomit stained clothes of Doherty as an inspiration, an artistic jump into the days of Rimbaud and Baudelaire. Some even have gone to great lengths to  recreate Doherty’s fashion sense .
Escaping from the constant harassment in Britain in the noughties, Doherty made a beeline to Paris where he thought he could escape the rozzers, and get more recognition. Sadly, his karma has caught up with him, and once again he’s getting  arrested , this time by his French friends, the gendarmerie.
Could Doherty’s long life be down to a bit of  fakery ? Exuding an outward image of a piss artist yet secretly indulging in a macrobiotic diet and an extensive exercise program?
We will never know, mes amis, but until that time, here is to a long life for monsieur Doherty."
Palace Insider: Meghan Markle Wanted to Teach Queen How to Twerk,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/33158-palace-insider-meghan-markle-wanted-to-teach-queen-how-to-twerk.html,2019,"Now that Meghan Markle has successfully blackified the once squeaky clean white Vogue magazine, she is working very hard to blackify the Windsor royal family by teaching the women how to twerk.
“Imma teach da Queen how to twerk, she need ta learn da black ways!” Meghan was overheard saying last week.
Most people do not know what ‘twerking’ is, let alone the royals, so it is definitely an education in black culture. Twerking is defined as a type of dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance.
Wayeshaquanda Daquone, 23, an amateur dancer from Baltimore, USA, was delighted that Meghan Markle was educating the British royal family on African American culture.
“I am so proud of Megain, she showin’ those cracker royal ass hoes how to act lak a black bitch ‘n’ twerk, I so proud of her. Amone ax her if I can come ovah to da palace and teach da Queen personally.”"
Harry and Meghan to Take 6 Weeks Off From Permanent Vacation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/34144-harry-and-meghan-to-take-6-weeks-off-from-permanent-vacation.html,2019,"It’s a hard life taking private jets and first class trips around the world where your every whim is catered for and you are attended by numerous staff hand and foot.
Meghan and Harry have announced they will take six weeks off during the Christmas period to travel around in private jets and stay in five-star boutique hotels at the expense of the British taxpayer.
Speaking to ITV, Meghan Markle told of her anguish: “It is hard. I have an entourage of 143 staff members attending to my daily needs, and travelling with them can be intense, simply because of the amount of luggage we have.”
Indeed, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan has so many people in her entourage, they have to take a separate plane to get to each destination.
Some of the entourage include a specific sharpie pen holder (sharpies can come in many colours), four manicurists, five pedicurists, twelve hair stylists, eighteen PR officials, and even six diaper changers for baby Archie, who can have violent blowouts at any time.
Prince Harry, has a rather simpler arrangement and even dresses himself, much to the chagrin of Meghan.
Amongst the many foibles the new Duchess exhibits, is a rather unsavoury appetite for freebies.
Whenever the new royal stays at one of these five-star hotels, Meghan likes to take the cutlery and bath robes and anything else she thinks is valuable. In Frogmore, staff have been astounded at the amount of booty Meghan collects from every five-star visit.
“We find bed side clocks, hair driers, Mormon bibles, and even a stool, amongst all the silver cutlery she has appropriated from these five-star establishments. It’s not only the cutlery, if there is a buffet at the hotel, she will ask staff members to take four of five plates worth of food to her room which she wraps up in kitchen paper and takes home. Most of it is then dumped in the compost at Frogmore because she forgot about it, or it went rotten,” one former staff member recalls.
It is certainly hard work being a new royal and many people are now gushing over Meghan on twitter after her tear soaked interview recently on ITV.
“It’s hard, because like, when I had my £700,000 baby shower in America, I got home sick on the plane back to the miserable Britain where everyone hates me.

“Imma axe y’all to nawt tek any photigraffs ‘n’ shiet so as to preservisize da privacy ‘n’ shiet of da duchess in da Frogmore Castle ‘n’ shiet, yanumsayin?” Meghan’s personal maid, Latoyshaquanda tells reporters as they enter the newly renovated property.
Immediately, we are all dazzled by the extravagant furnishings that would make a grotesquely vulgar rapper on an episode of ‘Cribs’ blush with embarrassment.
Fifty Cent (Fiddy) would have a hernia just looking at this gold and fake diamond covered shit.
The sofas, gold and pink in colour, shine so much that many reporters have to cover their eyes, and no one is allowed to sit on anything even though the seats are covered in cheap plastic sheeting.
“Unh, unh, none o y’all muffuggas allowed on da couch. I see any o ya niggaz even tryin’ dat shit Imma bust some caps in yo azz!” Latoyshaquanda bellows at the top of her voice.
The paintings on the walls previously were 18th and 17th century masterpieces depicting beautiful English rural scenes but those were thrown out with the rest of the antiques and replaced with garish vulgar portraits of Meghan. There is not one picture of Harry anywhere.
“Dis here da humanitarianz room! George Clooney and his waff Anal visit here to present Meghan wit nu prajects n shiet. I dunno whut goes on here but y’all can see a map of da wurld on da wall, she gon conquer it awl!”
Later, Latoyshaquanda ushers the guests into the newly built bespoke basketball court where Megain brings all her American friends to play. There is a fully stocked bar and fast food joint to the rear. According to servants, Meghan likes to have assorted American delicacies like fried chicken wings sent up to her room on a regular basis as well as tonnes of bananas, chitlins, collard greens, rice and beans, ham hock, corn bread, chicken feet.
“Sho! She can call at 4am ‘n’ say she wants a bucket chicken, fries, onion rings, jug of cola, strawberry sundae wit awl da trimmings, some cawfee, ‘n’ a pepperoni pizza. Our chef don’ sleep, he serve dat bitch all da tam! Yanumsayin?”
The guests were not permitted to view the bedrooms, but the maid lets slip that since the baby was born, poor prince Harry now sleeps in a separate room on his own.
“Massa Harry, his room just gotta beid. Thassit! Poor mufugga! Oops!”
Someone points at a red phone.
“Dat is da phone Meghan dialls da Queen to ax her fo’ mo money! It flashes red when da Queen cawls to tell Meghan she dun somthang wrong agin! Thas when she ignore it!” Latoyshaquanda, reveals giggling to herself."
Massacre at Handforth Parish Council,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40854-massacre-at-handforth-parish-council.html,2021,"Whoever Jackie Weaver is it seems the poor woman had a mouthful of vitriol sent her way during a very important Handforth parish council meeting of the highest national importance.
Entertainment wise, the meeting exceeded any political satire written in a long time, including anything we could produce. In fact, the Daily Squib would love to be punched in to all future meetings of Handforth Parish Council. We don’t even know where Handforth is, but it does not really matter.
“Quite rightly!” one of them shouts as the self-appointed Chairman of the Council moans about being chucked out of the last meeting.
Points of Order…?
Jackie Weaver doesn’t know what the fook is going on, she throws the Chairman out of the meeting anyway? All of them then gang up on the woman as she warbles on and on thinking she is in charge.
Welcome to Handforth Jackie Weaver, a real trooper.
Is this the sort of shit coming from Cheshire East? Surely, not!
Let’s set up a sub-committee of a committee sub meeting and talk about nothing for hours."
Some Sort of Lives Do Something,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40214-some-sort-of-lives-do-something.html,2020,"I’ll admit, before I walked into that plant-based, crispy-chicken-sandwich co-op, I was naïve—a pitiful ignoramus, even. Don’t get me wrong, I’d always been perfectly aware of lives (and the many different manifestations that said lives might take).  I suppose my knowledge of various types of lives and their respective doings just lacked a certain specificity—the slightest of nuances— a je ne sais quoi.
On that fateful lunch-hour, coming-and-going out of that colorful eatery, I counted hundreds of varieties of lives:  There were bent-over lives and fully erect lives—fabulous lives and dull, boring, drab lives.  There were lives in heels and lives on wheels.  There were lives with gaping holes in their earlobes and lives with faded knuckle tattoos.  Also, there were roly-poly lives and skinny-as-a-rail lives.  Hairy, bald, thin and thick lives; pasty, paltry, piggish and/or puppyish lives; rich, bitchy, snooty, snobbish, highfalutin lives and  et cetera —lives galore—no shortage of them.
As I watched and pondered, astute observer I am, it occurred to me that I had once been aware of one specific classification of lives that fulfilled a highly specified function—but what sort of lives those were and what it was that they did exactly I just couldn’t quite put my finger on.  I knew, for instance, that burger-flipping lives wear paper hats (that’s common knowledge).  I recalled from my schooling days that janitorial lives tie knots in garbage bags and lunch-serving lives stock tiny milk-cartons into knee-level refrigerators.  Conversely, some other lives are notorious for what they do not (or cannot) do.  For instance, odoriferous lives don’t bathe and incontinent lives can’t unbuckle their jeans fast enough.
Perhaps, I thought, all lives perform this isolated all-important task (whatever it might be).  That would make sense as according to the principles of equity and inclusivity (which had just been explained to me very slowly in a mandatory ZOOM seminar).   I soon found myself shaking my head at that notion, however.  All lives couldn’t possibly conform to the same rigid schedule—they’d collide head-first.  Whatsmore:  even if  all lives were adept at carrying out this illusive function, this fact might (for reasons undoubtedly valid) be better left unstated.
But what was it? I wondered aloud.  I was growing evermore agitated at my inability to recall this critical bit of information.  Feathered lives lay eggs.  Pubescent lives squeak when they talk.  Francophile lives daydream about summer-homes in Nice. Non-sequitur lives eat Korean shrimp-chips while jangling keys at babies and humming the National Anthem in reverse.  Dammit! I shouted.  Something  lives  something…
The young lady(?) behind the counter very graciously thrust my order at me without saying a word.  Turning toward the door, I took a quick peak in the bag and realized that she’d forgotten to include my complimentary pickle (a serendipitous mistake if ever there was one).  I paused to breathe a sigh of complete exasperation and, as it would happen, out of the corner of my eye, in a profoundly epiphanic moment,  I saw the sign.

Eurovision Song Contest : Badly Dressed Parade of Tone Deaf Dickheads,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42257-eurovision-song-contest-badly-dressed-parade-of-tone-deaf-dickheads.html,2021,"It is not exactly a revelation that the politically biased and motivated Eurovision Song Contest is not about musicality in any shape or form. Let us simply analyse the name – Euro (The EU state) Vision (a showcase of the EU states’ supposed ‘magnificence’ to the rest of the world) Song (musicality and songs do not exist here) Contest (biased EU judges within a rigged voting system that elevates an EU member state for show for a year).
The grotesque vulgarity of the Eurovision Song Contest displays a diabolical affront to any form of music, lowering the art of composition, artistry in a cheap banal manner to the levels of base mediocrity and creative death.
If this is meant to be the epitome of thousands of years of Western European progress in the arts, let it hang its head in abject shame, a suppurating boil on the  asshole of humanity ‘s ultimate failure.
Greece 12 points Cyprus 12 points
Badly dressed dickheads grace the EU state funded vast stages miming to camp repetitive eurotrash muzak. It is certainly preferable to have one’s eyes slowly gouged out with rusty ice cream scoopers and ear holes plugged with fast drying concrete than to experience the puerile pestilence and infantile atrocities of the Eurovision Song Contest.
The insipid brown-nosing sycophantic presenters are vomit inducing scum who should be executed with no mercy for their contribution to the violation and death of creativity and artistry, these parasitic enablers are only EU state pawns in a politically motivated Sovietized fascistic state sponsored festival of vile automaton robotic NPC shite, all of them, cunts reading EU state written Goebbels propaganda autocues.
If there is a reason for war, this piece of moribund detritus would be it, and some entity would be welcome to plough through the continent erasing the EU and silencing the Eurovision Song Contest forever. One could only dream of such a momentous gesture, for if it ever became a reality, the stars would align in universal celebration and the rest of the world would rejoice in the party of the century.
As an environmental pollutant, the Eurovision Song Contest should be classified as dangerous as the methane gas emitted from the arses of millions of herds of cows, but at least when a cow moos or farts, the sound is sweeter than anything emitted from the Eurovision Song Contest."
Harry and Meghan Close to Joining Scientology Cult,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42305-harry-and-meghan-close-to-joining-scientology-cult.html,2021,"Get your Thetans and E-meters ready, Harry and Meghan are now considering joining the Los Angeles chapter of the Scientology cult, close members of the former royal’s group have revealed.
The Church of Scientology’s leader David Miscavige, has already visited the couple’s Montecito mansion, and rumour has it that Meghan and Harry got on with the cult chief like a house on fire.
“Miscavige sees Harry and Meghan as a real coup for the Church. Oprah introduced the couple to Miscavige. Along with luminaries like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, amongst many Hollywood celebrities in the Scientology cult, the profile of the Church would be raised to legendary status with the new additions,” one Scientology observer revealed on Wednesday.
Harry and Meghan have already been audited, and now carry e-meters wherever they go. Auditing can be an expensive business, and Scientology cult members dish out sums like $10,000 for each audit, sometimes running multiple times a week. You don’t have to be an accountant to realise that money can be pissed away very quickly, enriching the Church of Scientology’s already overrunning coffers further.
According to aides close to the couple, Harry has suddenly been cured of his aversion and anger towards the royal family.
“As soon as he put that e-meter on his head and swished it around, Harry invoked the great Thetans into his bruised soul cleansing him of the negative standard memory bank eons accentuating Harry’s beingness and determinism. His engrams were through the fucking roof man as he went into Est repair mode getting out of his constant service facsimile, and his genetic entity elevated to extreme havingness mode through his reactive mind. I immediately called INCOMM as we went into overrun, and Harry’s OT got a hold of him with infinite perceptics. Harry’s restimulation verificational setting was full of self determinism getting ridness of the suppressive persons in his life. Harry then gave me $20,000 right there and then making me very happy,” the Scientology operator in charge of the former royal revealed in the latest edition of  Freedom Magazine .
It’s safe to say we won’t hear from Harry and Meghan for a while. Thank you, Church of Scientology for your services. Just send the pair to Sea Org and put them in a cage cleaning floors for the rest of their sorry lives."
Exclusive: Fappening 2014 Leak Was From Weinstein Phone iCloud,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26460-exclusive-fappening-2014-leak-was-from-weinstein-phone-icloud.html,2017,"There was an extreme cover up after the Fappening 4chan leak in 2014, in which trophy photos of actresses in compromised positions were dumped on mass to the Internet as seen on sites like freshfappening dot com.
What the hacker did not reveal is the iCloud phone source where all these trophy pictures came from — Harvey Weinstein.
Weinstein fits the profile exactly, as he liked to catalogue his exploits. This is what sexual predator/rapists do according to criminologists.
The photo of a youthful Jennifer Lawrence wryly smiling whilst exhibiting a glazed face is most definitely a Weinstein trademark trophy photo. After those photos were taken, Lawrence was propelled into great fame via the Hunger Games. She, much like other actresses had earned her way to the top by being a ‘good girl’.
Any internet search comes up with a treasure trove of multiple photos of actresses in compromised positions, for all to see and download.
Fapocalypse
The Fappening photo dump is proof that many actresses in Hollywood have to put out, or get out. As much as the claims of walking out on Weinstein go, these are mere fabrications to keep a public profile and honour. There is no actress in this world who will ever admit she got down on her knees to get a role, for a start she has most probably relegated that awful memory to the ass end of her memory, an amnesiac trauma that is forgotten, secondly, to admit to such a thing would be career suicide. Instead, there is a wall of silence.
Weinstein had power because he could get these girls roles in films that would make them famous. He exploited this for his own pleasure much to the agony and desperation of these young women who needed a break — that final hurdle into the limelight and the red carpet.
Sadly for the exploited, the Fappening has come back to haunt these actresses like a bad case of the clap. It just keeps getting dredged up time and time again. Once the pictures hit the net, they are nigh on impossible to erase, a moment these actresses have to live over and over again, a recurring nightmare that ceases to go away.
One can only feel a certain sense of dismay and bewilderment to see such intimate pictures of assorted starlets displayed for everyone to see. Is there a ‘feel sorry for them’ factor, after all these are human beings displaying their private parts, their glazed faces, and their ultimate greed, for it is their pure hunger for fame and money that made them do it? There should be no remorse, either for them, or for Weinstein. They laid their beds all too willingly."
New Hollywood Movie: ‘Meet the Fockers Part Deux’ Hits Box Office,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26627-new-hollywood-movie-meet-the-fockers-part-deux-hits-box-office.html,2017,"Starring Dustin Hoffman as Dirty Focker, Kevin Spacey as Pedo Focker, and Harvey Weinstein as Rapey Monster Focker, this time around, Bobby Deniro, Stiller and Barbara Streisand took a rain check on the ill-fated project.
As far as the plot for the film goes, without giving away too many spoilers, there’s a lot of sickness in this film that will have you reaching for the puke bag more than the pop corn.
The film is about three Focker brothers who use their power in Hollywood to do horrible deeds.
Producer and actor in the project, Harvey Weinstein came out of hiding to talk about his role: “I do a lot of focking. I even Fock plant pots. Like I fock this actress after I promised her a role in this movie, but once I did the focking, I forgot her name, but she sure as hell remembered mine. It was consensual, at least that is what I heard above the screaming.”
Pedo Focker, Kevin Spacey reveals in the LA Times that his role was highly enjoyable because there was no come-back for his evil actions, unlike in real life when the truth finally reared its ugly head.
The Usual Suspects
“The test screenings went well. People would flee the theatre crying uncontrollably and many were so distressed they needed counselling on a long term basis. Out of all the Fockers I’d say in terms of evil, it was up against Weinstein Focker and Spacey Focker,” the director of the film, Roman Polanski revealed from Croatia."
Mysterious Man May Know Where Lady Gaga’s Stolen Dogs Are,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41173-mysterious-man-may-know-where-lady-gagas-stolen-dogs-are.html,2021,"Lady Gaga’s dog walker was shot and her two French bulldogs, Koji and Gustav, were stolen Wednesday night in Hollywood, a source close to the singer revealed.
The source said the  celebrity  “is offering half-a-million dollars to anyone who has her two dogs, no questions asked.”
There are many theories going around about who stole the dogs that belong to the celebrity.
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said a man was shot during a robbery before 10 p.m. outside Lady Gaga’s residence and was transported to the hospital in stable condition.
The male suspect, who looked Chinese, took the two bulldogs from the victim, used a semi-automatic handgun and fled the scene in a white sedan, according to police.
One source has allegedly come forward though, and is keeping his identity a mystery due to the nature of the crime.
“I know who took the dogs. I was walking through China Town the other day and accidentally took a wrong turn. In the alleyway were these two little bulldogs that looked suspiciously like the ones Gaga lost.
“It was dark, but I could see these Chinese cooks come out of the backdoor of a Chinese restaurant illegally open. The dogs were in cages, and the Chinese took them into the kitchen. I then heard chopping sounds after a little yelping.”
The Chinese eat dog meat all the time, and believe dog meat has special medicinal properties. There is even a dog eating festival held every year in  Yulin, Guangxi Province, China  where dogs are brutally skinned alive then cooked.
The man then went into the Chinese restaurant to confront the cooks but instead ordered some Chop Suey, because he said it smelled so good.
“After I finished my meal, I crunched down on something hard. It was part of a dog’s collar, it was partially readable I could only make out the letters G-U-S-T.”
After projectile vomiting over the table, the man was thrown out of the restaurant by four angry Chinese waiters, who kept saying what a waste of good food. The waiters then scraped up the vomit to put it in the Won Ton soup for other customers.
Lady Gaga’s entourage were not replying to questions about the alleged incident.
The investigation is ongoing."

Hollywood Planning 498 New Superhero Movies in New Year,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26984-hollywood-planning-498-new-superhero-movies-new-year.html,2018,"Hollywood moguls are planning another onslaught of dumb American superhero movies for the new year it has been revealed.
“Just when you thought culture, or what’s left of it can’t get more fucking banal these money grabbing lazy assholes in the Hollywoodland movie biz are planning on hundreds more superhero movies, however, news is they’re running out of superheroes to make films of. We are now getting superhero films of superhero groups within superhero groups like mixing Batman with Superman and so on. It’s getting so tedious that people are getting genuinely pissed off about it. You seen the cinema attendance record lately?” Aldous Muxley, a cinema critic wrote in his latest newspaper article.
No More Creativity
Superheroes now come in all shapes, races, sexuality and sizes, some being conjured up according to whatever socialist agenda is the taste of the day. We witnessed the resurrection of Wonder Woman for the almighty feminist agenda, and the African Americans are to get their own black Panther superhero to sate the appetite of the angry disenfranchised black cinema going audiences..
What we need now is maybe a Sikh superhero or Chinese one, why do superheroes only have to be black or white, why not a lighter shade of brown or Oriental? Transexual lesbian Filipino superheroes from outer space with five milky breasts under each arm squirting universal teat juice into the eyes of criminals everywhere.
Alien superhero spawn that don’t even live on planet earth or care about it or look human, they’re just blobs, green fatty blobs that fly around splatting on the walls or messing up windows with their greasy jello skin?
Insect superheroes, or superhero penguins from Iceland could forge a good global warming warning for the millennial generation.
“We’re coming up with an Eskimo superhero called Igloo. He has shamanic powers and lives in an…igloo somewhere in the North Pole,” an elated executive of Warner Bros. recently revealed in Entertainment Weekly.
How about a Hollywood film that has no superheroes? Maybe something with a real plot, real fucking actors and a script that lasts more than the lifecycle of a bargain bin?"
Moaning Luvvie and His Continual Last Film,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26815-moaning-luvvie-continual-last-film.html,2017,"As luvvies go Daniel Day Lewis is top of the herd, and a truly celebrated actors actor, however he keeps having these moments of self-pity and declaring this is his last film.
“O woe is me, I am a celebrated actor, I act, I become the role. This was my last film,” he said in the previous film he acted in.
It must be such a chore, such a hurdle to be so celebrated, to be at the top of the actors pile, and this is the only way Mr. Lewis can cope with it.
Whether it’s working as a cobbler or spending long days in the mansion moping about his celebrated status, Daniel Day Lewis is just an over privileged pompous old fool who probably thinks the world revolves around his fat luvvie head.
Grow up man. If it’s your last ever fucking film, like the other ones, just go away without announcing it every time. What do you want, a fucking medal or something for doing something you profess to hate so much?
There are literally millions of wannabe actors who would drag their genitals over miles of broken glass to even get a position like Daniel Day Lewis, but here he is moaning into his champagne.
Why don’t you actually do something other than moping around and moaning? Not many people even know you exist?"

#metoo ‘Hypocrites’ Stunned By Brigitte Bardot Fight Back,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/27155-metoo-hypocrites-stunned-brigitte-bardot-fight-back.html,2018,"French poet, Gilles Luxure, speaks about the indomitable Gallic charm of the French female:
“French women, elegant, refined, philosophical, speak the language of L’amour, where their counterparts, either American or British certainly do not. Where you see the British women, hair unkempt, cigarette in mouth using foul language, rolling around in the gutter drunk out of their mind, and the American dumbed down celebrity obsessed women sipping their soy latte and using up all their men’s credit cards in restaurants, there is no comparison to the delicate yet strong French woman, a style upon herself, and a woman who understands the urges of the male, and appreciates the complement, thus not throwing it back in the face of masculinity with puritanical anglo-saxon feminist hatred.”
And it is to this end, the puritanical sovietized extreme-socialist #metoo fad is running out of steam. First,  Catherine Deneuve  and 100 of her fellow French women spoke up against the puritanical anti-male rhetoric that has become a witch hunt against men, and now the formidable 50s iconic beauty  Brigitte Bardot  has spoken.
“I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass. This kind of compliment is nice.”
Bardot also aligned with the view that women are responsible, saying actresses “come on” to producers to get roles, “and then, so they’ll be talked about, they say they were harassed”
T he 83-year-old added that the movement got in the way of “important themes that could be discussed” and that actresses, rather than all women, were, in “the vast majority of cases… hypocritical, ridiculous, without interests”."
We Forgot About the New Star Wars Film,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26953-forgot-new-star-wars-film.html,2017,"Oh yeah, there is a new Star Wars film doing the rounds, but it is so crap and unmemorable that we actually forgot to write up a review of it.
The film is a mismatch of different scenes plonked onto one stale piece of moribund shit, that is frankly a disservice to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who watches any type of film for that matter. The funny thing is it’s not a film because it does not really have a storyline or plot but sort of meanders along with little battle scenes plonked in every few minutes.
Snoke, a deadly Sith lord, who is supposed to be very powerful, is chopped in half by a wayward lightsaber accident within the first few minutes of encountering him. Such a terrible waste, not only of Siths but of action scenes. Obviously the film-makers were way too lazy to bother having a full-on fight with a Sith lord, instead he gets chopped in half like some pathetic piece of mutton in a Halal butcher’s shop down in Leytonstone on a Saturday afternoon.
The rest of the film is too stupid and boring to even mention. Luke Skywalker is a miserable old fart who is found on a Scottish island milking odd prosthetic plastic creatures’ fleshy teats and fishing with a long pole. Finn is the token black bloke in space who always looks surprised  and sweaty in a space suit. Princess Leia, in reality was so coked up on drugs she did not know where the fuck she was, and this showed in the film as she stumbles from one scene to another looking like a Hollywood botox casualty on multiple lines snorted from the star ship’s dashboard. The female heroine of the film, has her hair pulled so far back on her head that she resembles a Croydon chavette in space. The only thing missing is a pair of hoop earrings, a crying baby and a fucking tracksuit.
Kylo Ren, or whatever his name is as well as his sidekick are spoiled little brats having tantrums in space. It’s one tantrum after another, as they fling pieces of lego around the set.
The finale, with a teleported astral vision of Luke doing a walkabout is the only bit worthy of the whole film. That is it. The rest of it is absolute bollocks. Oh, one last mention, the crimson red background and Elite Praetorian Samurai-esque guards for Snoke were pretty cool..that’s it though..
Star Wars used to be something special. Those days are all gone. Now it is something resembling Harry Potter or some other cutesy Hollywood crud that is simply a vehicle for some new director to establish himself in the biz. The formulaic nature of the new Star Wars films skimps on introducing new characters, new innovations and new story lines instead delving into a tired old soap opera consisting of just a few mediocre characters following each other around in space in an endless circle.
It is probably too late but if you are going to see this film, do not pay for it, because this would encourage more of its ilk to be made. Simply go onto the many streaming services on the net and watch it for free in full HD."
Sunglass Fashion For Women This Summer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/27146-sunglass-fashion-women-summer.html,2018,"Looking ahead to the summer months away from the dreary grey winter, we have some great ideas for the enterprising cool women’s sunglass fashion this year.
What’s in and what’s out?
This year there’s going to be a real retro invasion, something from the sixties, the seventies and maybe as back as the fifties, although the thirties and twenties are so back we don’t know if they really had a burgeoning sunglass fashion then but we could always check on Google. As I’m writing this I have not done any research to the subject whatsoever, and basically don’t care.
Without much ado, let’s move on to dark sunglasses. Yes, you can wear dark black sunglasses but it all depends on what your mood is.
Sunglasses with a red or yellow tinge to them. These are good for parties and drinking your favourite coffee outside some Soho coffee shop after work.
Don’t forget sunglasses with the mirror lenses. Yes, they’re naff, and if you’re seen wearing these you deserve to get the shit beaten out of you with a baseball bat.
So, there we go, that’s the review for this year. Fashionistas everywhere wear what is in or just get fuck out."
Feminist Model Sues Men Who Look at Her,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26468-feminist-model-sues-men-look.html,2017,"As she posed on the front steps of the Sixty Beverly Hills Hotel, Coco’s bold fashion statement saw her almost completely expose herself to the cameras.
The only catch — if you are male and look at her, you are immediately handed a signed form from a lawyer waiting around the corner suing you for looking at her body.
“I can dress like this but it does not mean a man can look at me. I am wearing a dress with a strategically placed metal ring gripping the two sides of my dress together across my massive heaving bust to make sure they are barely kept under wraps. That does not mean that you have the right as a male to look at what I am flouting. It is my feminist right to wear what I want, but it is not your right as a male to be attracted to me or my body.”
Coco’s lawyer had a busy time throughout the night as any male caught even glancing towards her was handed the form suing them for sexism and something that is called ‘eye-ball rape’, a new statute created in the California courts, where women are given rights way above any men.
One guilty man who was sued was close to tears as he said that he looked at her bust momentarily because there was pretty much nowhere else to look at.
“Her lawyer handed me the form saying that I will be sued for over $500,000 for the crime of looking at her bust. I have been arraigned to appear at LA County court next week. I can’t afford that kind of money, and I’ll have to sell everything. I’m finished!”
Arriving at the event and fluttering huge eyelashes, Coco provocatively partied with a host of other celebrities including Gina Tootitts, Marianna Trench and Lois Poussie.

To this end, her husband, Kanye West is going to conduct another expensive fashion show to raise funds, and has even taken to Twitter to beg for money to buy more jewels.

2016 The Year Satan Collected,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/21557-2016-the-year-satan-collected.html,2016,"Speaking from the crossroads, just east of Clarksdale, Mississippi, we asked the devil what business was like in 2016?
“It been good, I got me a good crop this year. Bowie, Prince, George Michael. They had the full run of what I offered them. They signed on the dotted line all those years ago, and when it was time to collect, all I had to do was stand by and let their souls slip through. This is one contract they couldn’t get out of.”
To have such musical icons lose their physical bodies in 2016 has been quite the harvest for satan but still he’s waiting on some big souls who have been holding out for way too long.
“I’m still waiting on a friend, or two. The Rolling Stones will eventually roll my way again, they been holding out, I give em my respec’, but Mick and Keith, you’ve had your run and then some, I made you the greatest surviving rock’n’roll band in the world. Sooner or later you’re gonna have to come to papa.”
Wearing a pristine black suit, black hat and sporting a toothy grin that could make milk curdle, the devil winks mischievously, then disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving a slight sulphurous smell.
It’s just turned midnight, the crossroads is now empty."
Madonna Seen Lurking Outside White House,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/21710-madonna-seen-lurking-outside-white-house.html,2017,"At about 12.00 EST Madonna was spied skulking around Pennsylvania Avenue with what appeared to be some ominous sticks of dynamite.
Agent 9, Secret Service, revealed the full story to waiting news reporters: “We saw Madonna walking up and down the street. I signalled to my fellow agents and spoke in my earpiece, you know like we do all the time. She saw me, then tried to act normal even though she had three sticks of dynamite in her hand. I caught up with her and told her in no uncertain terms to take that dynamite and get the hell away from the White House. Madonna, looked me up and down, grabbed her crotch, then skipped away singing ‘La Isla Bonita’. Thanks to the secret service another tragedy was averted. We deserve a medal or something for our bravery.”
Madonna, who is said to have thought about ‘blowing up the White House’ is said to be distraught after Donald J. Trump became president of the United States of America."
Oscars Doo Doo Land Wins,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/22146-oscars-doo-doo-land-wins.html,2017,"Hollywood is now officially dead, although it died a long time ago, it really is a corpse full of preening maggots undulating amongst the rotting flesh of poor scripts, mediocre actors and the tendency to bypass plots and rely on CGI.
The only thing that makes money now for studios is superhero movie knock-offs of knock-offs, and cutesy animated CGI cartoons. That’s it. How many times do you want to see a penguin jumping up on an iceberg talking in a Brooklyn accent? Fuck that, and fuck Hollywood, let us hope it falls into the sea never to be seen again.
Unless something is done soon, there will be absolutely no audience. Aha, audience, what audience! Cinema bookings are practically zero now, what with streaming you can see any film you ever heard of on the internet for free in HD. Many people have renounced cinemas purely on the precept that giving a single dime to the studios is a serious crime. Why in the world would you want to do that? Why support bullshit? There is no plot no script no cinematography even worth waving your dick at any more let alone paying for. Today’s studio bosses should be ashamed of themselves, how they have run their own industry into the ground, you are all to blame, and this is why people do not want to go to cinemas any more.
Hollywood, take your formulaic banal pap and stick it where the sun don’t shine. It’s over."
Latest Thrill Seek: Getting Dragged Off a United Airlines Flight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/24916-latest-thrill-seek-getting-dragged-off-united-airlines-flight.html,2017,"Thousands of thrill seekers are flocking to United Airlines booking offices across the U.S. with the hope they get dragged kicking and screaming from a flight before it takes off.
“We saw that guy, he was treated worse than an animal being pulled by those burly thugs just so they could have a member of staff take his seat. It would definitely be exciting, maybe tie a bungee cord to your seat so when they drag you out shtooom you fly back in,” Brad Mycine, 21, an avid extreme sports fan told Fox News.
The way that some airline passengers are treated has always been a fascinating topic, however to pull people by their hair or legs off a flight is a next step in brutality.
Psychologist Dan Barnes tried to explain why United Airlines would do such a thing.
“They just don’t care, literally they don’t give a shit about paying passengers. They see so many every day, it’s like nothing to them to drag one off a plane. They’re conditioned over many years to not care or feel anything.”
One board member for United Airlines said: “The fuckers are lucky we don’t drag them off the plane at 35,000 feet.”"

Good News Kardashians Completely Wiped Off Face of Earth,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/13531-good-news-kardashians-completely-wiped-off-face-of-earth.html,2015,"Today, we are proud to present such a story. From now on no one will ever hear about the Kardashians, the awful family that plagued the world with their inane, banal existence for so long.
Everything has been erased, that family’s awful name is history, all news outlets around the globe have deleted every morsel of the name from their networks, magazines, reports and all forms of media.
The family themselves were jettisoned into space today imprisoned in a shuttle that will travel the galaxy or hopefully into an asteroid belt somewhere near Alpha Centauri.
Banishing such a horrible clan of useless, greedy, feckless brain dead morons can only be good for humanity, and many cheered as the shuttle lifted off from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday.
“To think these parasites, useless pieces of garbage were on all forms of media for so long is like a case of cancer on the human race. They were like a cancerous tumour feeding off human existence, today I feel joy in my heart, and finally some respite now they have gone; like I can actually breathe again. To say I hated them is an understatement, I would rather eat crushed glass than listen or see another dumbed down report of one of them and their vacuous shallow lives. Travel through space, please never come back, let’s hope they run out of air or Kim’s fat ass implants explode blowing a hole in the fuselage and sucking the lot into a black hole,” Arthur Willis, one of the mission control engineers told CNN.
According to estimates, the oxygen supply will only last for six days. Those who were worried at the cost of launching the vile family into space need not be concerned as NASA used a decommissioned shuttle that was destined for the scrap heap any way.
All across the globe, fires have been burning as millions of people purge the earth of any mention of the horrible family that plagued so many. Computer hard disks were smashed, news outlets shredded thousands of documents, and all merchandise pulverised then incinerated.
Search engines across the internet have been sweeping all sites and deleting all mention of the family, but this may take some time as the infection has been so prevalent.
The money the horrible family amassed through their evil trickery, spam, and contagion has also been put to good use.
“We took all their money which they acquired by basically spamming everything. That money is going to be used to help starving children in the world, it’s going to be put to good use. They certainly would not do such a thing, but we are,” Angelina Dolly, a representative of the UN revealed at a press conference immediately after the launch into space."
Black Overload: Oscars Go All White,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/16920-black-overload-oscars-go-all-white.html,2016,"“First things first, why are there no Oriental actors nominated for the Oscars? Why are there no Polynesian actors nominated? Because the English speaking world is primarily for those people. Why do black actors want to hijack something, why don’t they go back to Africa and build their own film industry?” an industry insider in Hollywood revealed on Monday.
The truth is that people have had enough of the incessant moaning, the hijacking of everything by blacks in the entertainment industry and the world in general. Since Obama has become president, the hijacking of pretty much every genre of everything has been de rigueur, enabled by an administration that puts blacks above any other race.
What about Tibetans? Are they not humans, are they not good actors and actresses? What about Chinese or Japanese actors, or Indians? What about Arabic, or Turkish actors? There are some great actors in South America. Why does it just have to always be about black actors? There are other races in the world apart from entitled blacks, who seem to shout the loudest for everything and display little or no talent to back it up.
“Everyone has had enough of rap films, ghettoised cop films and all the other hip hop culture films. No one wants to watch that apart from dumbed down low intelligence troglodytes. Besides, watch any mainstream big studio Hollywood film, and you will see tonnes of black actors portraying people in positions of power, let’s reference Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson as two such actors. The former referenced actor is always the all-American father figure, the latter is always the wheeler-dealer African American. You buy a used car from Samuel L. Jackson? Hell no, he’ll convince you to get in the boot, take it round the corner and put a few caps in yo ass so you don’t blab,” another industry person revealed.
One angry former Hollywood executive said: “Stop hijacking! Don’t impose yourself on people that do not want to see your face on the screen. Instead blacks should create their own film industry where they can indulge in their own dreams. There’s only so much black culture the rest of society can take.”"

The film is set in 2016 Britain and involves a fiendish plot to rig the EU Referendum so that Britain stays in the EU and hold the British people under ransom in an EU regime of totalitarian dictatorship where every facet of life is dictated by faceless eurocrats in a foreign country.
“This time the PM doesn’t send in the SAS, because in the film, the PM is a bad guy, and so are most of the Cabinet. It’s up to someone within the government who fights for Britain and is not a treasonous slime ball to save the country,” Millhouse revealed to Empire magazine."
Music News: New Elton John Album Out Soon,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/18163-music-news-new-elton-john-album-out-soon.html,2016,"“I can’t leak the full album details but Elton pushed it to the max with this album, and it even has a cameo from his husband playing the piccolo whilst rolling around his Italian marble floor. The first track is the real kicker, we get the sound of a stool being pushed in kinda screechy sounding, then a splat as loads of blokes bundle in with their instruments. Some nice arpeggiation although the bridge is a bit floppy, but we just added more compression to the mix for a nice brown sound,” producer Vance Stubber, told Melody Maker magazine.
Where the album lapses in melodic function it prolapses in sheer volume of hits crammed into such a loose record.
“At one junction, we thought he lost it, Elton had a tantrum, because of something or rather,but after he stopped throwing things around we were back in junction and moving along fine.”
The homosexual couple hope to adopt more children from some Eastern European shit hole into their friendly family in the future, maybe they can all make albums together."

Certainly the Beatles and the Stones had no problems creating their music outside the European Union.
Naturally the Cameron pro-EU corporates have brought out the celebrities and luvvie media whores to tout the EU, when it is a fact that these people most probably have no knowledge about the European Union or what it does to nations or their people.
Does some bamboozled  celebritard  luvvie know or even care that TTIP will kill off the NHS and privatise it?  No, because said celebrity gets the best private healthcare and does not care what the plebs have to deal with.
Does some corporate controlled luvvie care that millions more people will flood Britain if we remain in the EU?  Of course not, if you have a penthouse and numerous mansions in the Hollywood Hills, where you don’t mix with the lowly people, why would you care?
Does the remain touting celebrity know that the UK has to send £350 million per week to Brussels with little return?  Probably not, and frankly they do not care less as long as they live their pampered lives in the cosy fantasy limelight of ego driven corporate funded dreams.
What about the evisceration of national sovereignty and ability to govern oneself under our own laws?  Why would a pampered celebrity even care about such a thing? They are more concerned with trivialities and shallow pleasantries within their plastic self-obsessed lives.
One must also take into account that celebrities and film starlets are not real artists, even though they may sometimes be called that. They are merely corporate slaves wheeled out to affirm whatever corporate whim is in the news at the time."

They’re travelling from West Africa to Chicago, and they have to resort to going on trains, boats, helicopters, and planes to get to where they want to go. It’s a beautiful film and comedic. There’s also a tinge of sadness as they realise they have Ebola when they get to their relatives house for Christmas and everyone there gets infected as well. The last scene will not leave a dry eye in the house, everyone dies of Ebola, including the pet budgie called Mooch.
The Daily Squib watched the pre-release version and we all wanted to get Hazmat suits immediately.
Five stars, recommended for your Christmas viewing. Release date December."

“Plane, Must, Hit, Steel”
And there was Georgie boy sitting there in silence, with a big quacking smirk on his face.
“Plane, Must, Hit, Steel”
Over and over the children say it, as the goat looks on, he knows very well that the plane must hit steel, as the façade crumbles into white dust, he does not flinch from the ritual.
Soon after, Obama, the enlightened enters the scene, the clown is gone, this next demon is taught that graduation is a must for the horned goat commands his total and utter obedience.
The ordinaries do not see what the enlightened see, it is not in their remit to even understand one symbolic gesture that flutters across the screen. And so it was the same with 911, it was a symbolic gesture, a feat of wonder, the century of change had begun with an almighty celebration.
As one moment passes another arises, listen to the horns of deception over the orchestra, what will you think in the FEMA camps? Was this all a dream or is this barbed wire actually real? Think for one second, really think."

We was cheerin’ and pattin’ that thang like it was our saviour,” Krupp Johnsons, a protester on South Florissant, Ferguson revealed.
Ferguson police chief, Enos Strate, warned Kardashian to stop shielding the rioters: “One thing fer shure, good thang she didn’t eat no beans that night, coulda ignited them gases into a big ol’ explosion.”

Celebrity Online Apologies Up by 35% Since September,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/10565-celebrity-online-apologies-35-since-september.html,2014,"Online apologies by celebrities and politicians were up by a staggering 35% since September the Office of Internet Statistics has revealed.
“We’re getting more snivelling celebrities and even some former politicians making these grovelling internet apologies after they’ve made a faux pas on some social network site or been recorded by a member of the public on their mobile phone or been caught evading tax. Unfortunately, with the advent of social sites like twitter and facebook, the general public has had to endure some of the inane rantings of celebrities who feel the need to voice their opinion,” Niles Gruberstein, an analyst and chief researcher at the OIS revealed.
PR agency, Benoire Mathers Liorres have given some of their celebrities advice on dealing with certain sections of social media and the more traditional media: “We advise our celebrity clients to get off all social media. If they value their celebrity status, even F rated celebrities have no business on there. It simply confirms to the public that these celebrities are vacuous morons addicted to faux adulation and greed. Just get off. If you need to make an announcement get about thirty people to read it before it is released because many of these celebrities are incapable of the intricacies of dealing with the public. Additionally, do not apologise. I never saw a good politician apologise for anything, and celebrities should follow that lead. Always deny, deny, deny, even if you’re caught red handed. Politicians get away with that technique all the time. That’s what I advise my clients to do.”"
R.I.P: Roddy Piper Lives,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/13393-r-i-p-roddy-piper-lives.html,2015,"The Eighties were a great time for films and one particular film that really stood out was They Live starring former wrestler Roddy Piper who sadly passed on today.
John Carpenter’s film They Live was not some big blockbuster or had amazing realism or top of the range actors but it told the truth, something that is direly missing in most films produced then and now.
Subliminal messages and symbols are everywhere, and if you are well versed, you can see them, without the special glasses.
Populations today are as unaware of the control mechanisms used to command them as they were in the Eighties, and it is to this end that the film They Live is still relevant.
If there is one film you must watch, then it must be They Live, a Carpenter masterpiece, much under-rated classic starring Roddy Piper.

It is not only the need to comment on out of depth knowledgeable subjects that drives ignorant out of touch pampered celebrities, but the need to be recruited by charities or any other cause that is the flavour of the week.
“The world revolves around my head. Before I was famous I did not care about charities or big causes, because I was the big cause. Every ounce of my energy went into me making it. Now however I am known by all, and have lots of money I suddenly ‘care’ about putting my name in front of causes, charities and other self serving vehicles for my ego.

“Who am I going to chastise for wearing fur now? I just went and bought a mink coat in honour of Joan Rivers,” a visibly distraught news reader for MSNBC, Dominic Lewsanius, revealed today.
As the funeral cortège snaked through Manhattan Village on Friday, liberals threw pieces of stripped bacon at the procession in honour of Joan’s famously vulgar humour.
“She would have liked that touch. It’s good that the liberals finally came up to her level of bad taste thinking. It took a whole life time but they finally got it after she died,” Rivers’s agent told news outlets.
One positive thing about Joan Rivers passing is that she will not decompose for the next 400 years. Maybe by then they can bring her back to life to entertain the liberals of the future."

State of the Music Biz: U2,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/9567-state-music-biz-u2.html,2014,"The only way to make money in the Biz today is to be an established iconic artist from the pre-internet era and tour. The cost of touring is astronomical, however if the band is iconic enough, they will fill bums on seats.
Bands like the Rolling Stones, who are above the Beatles in stature and longevity are the highest level there is currently, however when the ol’ chap at the crossroads comes for them, the contract is up. The Stones are a dying breed, and will never be seen again in the music business.
There’s no need to quote Hunter S. Thompson to realise that not only is the music business a terrible place, it is getting worse and worse as time goes by.
Long gone are the days of real artists, instead there is only background noise, no meat and potatoes. Profit has dried up completely as music is now a free product downloaded at any time and used as snippets for some banal gadget show on telly, or for a cookery show.
With vile banal reality circuses like X Factor, created by talentless arse holes like Simon Cowell, there is no music left, and besides how can you judge talent if the judges have no talent whatsoever or any sense of artistry or musicality? These shows are simply there to exploit vulnerable teenagers so that TV audiences can laugh and ridicule their bid for ‘stardom’. Cowell is a shameless evil wart on the arse of what used to be the music business, his blatant camp outrage and exploitative behaviour has made him rich off the backs of others’ misery.
Feed people enough excrement and eventually that’s all they know.
The music business is simply the victim of value, quantity and supply. If something has infinite supply in large quantities, it’s pretty much worthless. Yes, you can sell grass, sand or pebbles, but you’re not going to get much for it. Even established bands like U2 are seeing this now."

It’s a lovely feeling in the mud, we get squishy right in there, and when they go back to their tents we go right there with them, we love it, this is what the music is all about,” lead singer, Gastro Enteritis told Melody Maker magazine.
Glastonbury revellers were today raving about the band’s amazing performance.
“Afterwards I went back to my muddy sodden tent and vomited into my mate’s sleeping bag for three hours solid, then when there was nothing left, the diarrhoea was streaming like the falls man, it was wicked. The beauty about this band is they come home with you too, and stay with you for months,” Alfie Munter, 23, a keen Glasto fan told the BBC."

“Doh, I put all my info on there and say what I’m thinking, but I thought it was private. Then I read the  Pentagon  and DoD were controlling and funding the experiments. I’m really angry now, how could they? When I joined up I signed away all my rights but I didn’t know what I was doing.

Film Review: The Fappening Part Deux,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/9727-film-review-fappening-part-deux.html,2014,"To tell you the truth, unless you’re a pubescent fapping boy, the Fappening Part Deux is not that great, I mean who hasn’t seen Kim Kardashian’s  vagine  and bloated arse before?
Most men will simply look at this movie and say, yeah, not bad, nothing special, still tappable in some cases.
As for the Hillary Duff spread, one could imagine themselves on the set of a sci fi movie about to get sucked into a massive black hole.
Let’s not leave it to the imagination any more, this film will have you coming back for more, and more and more.
Part Deux fans will not be disappointed to hear that Jennifer Lawrence does feature again, but the image of her glazed face from the original Fappening movie will stick in our minds for an eternity.
The Fappening Part Deux also features some great soccer scenes, we won’t spoil the plot but there’s some awesome penalty shots saved by American goal keeper Hope Solo.
Does one feel sorry for these wayward lasses? Not really, they knew what they were doing, they were adults. Let’s not excuse the feckless idiots who don’t know what’s happening in the world, and can’t read, or simply want to exist in a netherworld of complete ignorance.
The premier for the Fappening Part Deux will be held on some day or other, and when the girls roll up onto the red carpet, everyone will simply point and wink. What else can you do after you’ve seen their most private parts spread wide open, is that right Bar Refaeli?
Many cinemagoers can’t wait till the Fappening Part Trois, maybe some Taylor Swift cameos are afoot, it’s a good thing there are plentiful supplies of toilet roll in this world."

Jeremy Clarkson was rather more sanguine about the whole affair: “I was blaring out Rule Britannia on my car stereo going through some favela when a large concrete block came through the rear window wrapped in an Argentinian flag. I immediately slammed on the accelerator and ran over an old man waving another Argie flag. I think at this point I thought I should reverse and took out a few more of the bastards. Made a right mess of my front bumpers and windshield.”
As for the hamster, last anyone heard, he was seen cowering in the boot of his car pleading diplomatic immunity.

New Celebrity Excrement Bucket Challenge Announced,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/9301-new-celebrity-excrement-bucket-challenge-announced.html,2014,"The Ice Bucket Challenge has had serious coverage but now there’s a new challenge for true celebrities.
“Sometimes I don’t get enough coverage, I call in the paps when I go shopping at Whole Foods or to grab a coffee. It’s all part of the game of me, me, me. This ice bucket challenge was great though, I don’t even know why celebs were doing it but I got the call Monday to do it and called in my personal photographer, Larry,” some celebrity said on another celebrity news site.
But hold on for one second, here’s a new challenge for the real die hard celebrities. You want to go that extra mile for more attention this challenge will really separate the wheat from the chaff, or should we say chunks from the diarrhoea.
The Excrement Challenge is being rolled out all over the internet with celebs queuing to be nominated.
“I heard it’s for the Daily Squib newspaper, the Excrement Challenge is no pansy ice bucket challenge for wimps, this challenge is the real deal that will confirm my celebrity status forever and it’s for the Daily Squib charity, they need to be able to buy tea and biscuits in their office once in awhile,” a celebrity model who once appeared on Big Brother 23 told celebrity site Z17.
Nominations are cancelled for this challenge, all wonderfully useful celebrities are welcome, the more obscure you are the better because you will get more exposure. If you are top of the tabloid newsworthy table at the moment, you can increase your exposure even further and get more adulation that you crave so much. If you have the desire to be photographed every five minutes of your life, this will give you six minutes of total exposure on a constant cyclical basis.
Instructions
1) Get as many people that you know to crap in a bucket. Tramps, gardeners, PR people, agents, anyone
2) Top up with water or urine, add a little ice if you wish to make an extra statement
3) Make sure you contact all the photographers and paparazzi beforehand to announce the challenge
4) Pour that shit over your head and smile
5) Enjoy the extra attention you get, congratulate yourself, you deserve to be above the rest
6) Read the papers, watch the news, it’s all about you, you, you. Remember contributing to charity anonymously is for losers"
Castrato Bond Theme Used to Curdle Cheese in Factory,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/14355-castrato-bond-theme-used-to-curdle-cheese-in-factory.html,2015,"“We getta this musica and put it on in the factory. The milk curdle nearly immediato maka fasta formaggio. Belissimo productione multiplo!”
What happened to James Bond, like the real secret agent, and what happened to the theme music of this tiring clinical moribund  Cubbiless  franchise?
Ah, but James Bond is moving with the times you say, so why the fuck did the producers choose a theme tune for the latest Bond flick that literally curdles cheese?
“We chose this singer and Bond theme tune because there is nothing in the musical sphere of x-factor led artistes of note any more and this sort of effete  autotuned  bilge is all that’s left. There is no more Barry or Martin or Bassey, just mediocre shite left in this world, watered down bilge, not even worth wiping your arse with. Since Cubby bought the farm, Bond has faltered, lost his sense of humour and become a vehicle for simple soulless action-led Mission Impossible politically correct remakes with a minor British slant and much deserved crap music,” one of the new producers for the latest Bond film said off camera.
Here’s to many more Bond films that we will never see."
Caught in the iCloud Female Hollywood Celebs in Frenzied Fapocalypse,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/9413-caught-icloud-female-hollywood-celebs-frenzied-fapocalypse.html,2014,"The Daily Squib offices have been on severe lockdown checking out the leaked photos much like everyone else who has an internet connection in the world, invariably these wonderful images will be ingrained in everyone’s collective consciousness for internet icloud eternity.
Naturally, the Daily Squib foresaw the dangers of  iCloud  in 2011 when it was first introduced. Coupled with the Edward Snowden revelations which we foresaw four years before him, this episode is merely a storm in a teacup. The celebrities in question, if they were ever in the loop, should know that observers in the National Security Agency have been viewing their pictures long before any hacker saw them. It’s simply common knowledge now that every part of the net is accessible by big brother.
If you’re a fan of Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay as much as we are, you will be particularly amused by the pic of her being poked in the eye tentatively by a John Thomas as she looks lovingly at it and pouts suggestively. Don’t know what the photos will do to her career but it’s great to see the Brits keeping up the helm?
Kate Upton, some bint off Sports Illustrated shows everyone that she has immaculate lips, her uncle, U.S. Representative Fred Upton (R-MI) must be so proud.
Hunger Games was a great movie, as were the follow ups, and its indomitable star, Jennifer Lawrence seems rather plain in the leaked photos, she is merely another self-obsessed selfie addict with a penchant for splashing her face with milky white dispersions from some lucky guy and putting the pics on the internet, not quite the heroine who gets one up on the ‘Illuminati’ as portrayed in her films.
The photos are celebratory fappings of a Hollywood destroyed by the internet and it’s own banal mediocrity, in an age where nothing is sacred any more, we get a glimpse of stupid stars who are not in control of themselves. Before the internet happened, actresses would be able to secure roles in films by completing their acts of kindness on deal makers anonymously. This gave the actresses a sense that they got the roles for their talent alone, especially in the eyes of the public. The internet era has however cast an altogether different light to how these paragons of opportunity become successful. The Hollywood machine is a much dilapidated industry now, especially when anyone can download any film they want in a few minutes for free.
As the marketing PR men scramble to salvage some semblance of dignity for their now completely unmasked starlets, and twitter scrambles to delete the accounts of the multitude of users spreading the lurid pictures like wildfire, a solitary question arises, why is it not okay to show a seemingly innocent looking media starlet displaying her glorious attributes for the camera and it is perfectly permissible for violent images of crazed jihadists to display their beheading activities? The answer lies within the Anglo world’s hang up on sex and the media’s fear inducing hunger for gratuitous violence. Keep them all in a constant state of fear at all times.
Next time you watch a film with one of these ladies, you may think to yourself throughout the entire film, the whole world has seen your badly packed kebab, but never mind eh, it’s all part of the biz.
The internet is a truly beautiful invention bringing smiles to a lot of people today. Enjoy."
Oktoberfest Changes From Last Year,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/13991-oktoberfest-changes-from-last-year.html,2015,"Oktoberfest is set to be quite a cracker this year, especially with the hundreds of thousands of migrants surging into Germany from Africa and the Middle East.
Otto Von Kleimer, the event’s organiser was sanguine about the beer, food and frolicking Fräulein festival.
“Although beer, pussy and pork is now banned in Germany, we still aim to try and have a good festival. Currently we are housing 400,000 refugees from Eritrea and Syria in tents, and the violent riots and ensuing chaos will still be mildly entertaining.”"
Feel the Force of the Fantastic Four,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/13688-feel-the-force-of-the-fantastic-four.html,2015,"This year we were treated to another instalment of the Fantastic Four featuring the likes of Kata Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller.
Offering a glimpse inside the world of crime fighting on a supernatural plane, the film has received mixed reviews from the public, but that hasn’t stopped the customary merchandise bandwagon from rolling on.
In between a  corporate row involving the X-Men , Fantastic Four’s merchandise is generating huge amounts of money around the globe thanks to a quirky mix of costumes, figurines and games. Of course, the line between old tat and quality merch is a fine one, which is why we’ve picked out some of the more interesting Fantastic Four options out there.
The Fantastic Four Retro Seatbelt
What does any Fantastic Four fanatic need when they want to look fresh? A belt that looks like a seatbelt, that’s what. Emblazoned with the familiar “4” logo, the  quirky seatbelt  turned trouser aid is as left-field as the comic genre itself and for £15 it’s a real bargain.
Fantastic Four Fizz
Those with a way with words will often tell you to “drink up the atmosphere” when something is deemed worth watching, but with the latest incarnation of the Fantastic Four you can literally taste the action. Thanks to a collaboration between Crush Soda and Marvel, you can now sample “4 Fantastic Flavours” with a selection of limited edition cans. In addition to offering a tasty movie accompaniment, Crush is also giving away a slew of free tickets to the movie.
Continuing the long-standing relationship between Marvel and the iGaming industry, fans of online slots can now ante-up and spin the reels in search of riches courtesy of the Fantastic Four online slot game. Imbued with an array of sights and sounds from the comic and film series, this game not only gives you a chance to win £100,000+ but a way to enjoy the best parts of the film in a new guise.
If you’re a fan of camping and really want to standout from the crowd, then a Fantastic Four sleeping bag is a must. Designed to hug each of your limbs individually, these superhero suits turned sleeping aids are a great way to stay warm but still stay ready for battle. Although the price of each Fantastic Four sleeping bag is close to £100, there’s no doubt they’ll keep you warm while you’re looking cool as hell.
Fantastic Four Threads
We couldn’t compile a list of Fantastic Four themed gifts and not throw in a t-shirt. A staple piece of merchandise, the humble round neck t-shirt is something every fan should want to own and we think the best option out there is the classic logo design. Bearing nothing more than the famous “4” logo and the team’s customary blue colour scheme, you can pick up this  Impact Merchandising product  for around £10 which means it’s an absolute bargain for every Fantastic Four fan."
Revealed: What Really Goes On Behind Scenes of Bilderberg?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/12631-revealed-what-really-goes-on-behind-scenes-of-bilderberg.html,2015,"“I have at great pain of death decided to reveal to you the goings on deep within the bowels of the Bilderberg meetings attended by high ranking members of the order every year.
“First, I must caution you the reader, to read this with an open mind, to not judge us too harshly, or to start spreading this piece around the internet like wildfire, because it is not in the general public’s interest that this knowledge is disseminated.
“To say that I am in great danger if anyone ever finds out who I am is an understatement, however, I choose to do this in the interests of the greater good.
“Okay, let me get started. The Bilderberg is always chaired by Henry. Once we are all assembled in the various hotels we occupy over the meetings over the years, he appears. He likes to wear a smoking jacket and puff on cigarettes while delighting everyone with stories of the Nixon days.
“The basic premise of the meetings is that we all have saunas, massages and enjoyable luncheons together. We are pampered, everything is on call.
“Business does resume after a day or so of frolicking. Here is the clincher, what you have been waiting to hear about what really goes on in the Bilderberg meetings; where those few chosen denizens of the highest order convene. We basically talk, that’s it, there is a conference room set up, and we talk about projected world affairs and what not.
“So there you have it mes amis, just a lot of talking, maybe a slide show here or there, drinks are on hand, then it’s back to the sauna. That’s it.”"
Virus that ‘Makes Humans More Stupid’ Discovered,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/10336-virus-makes-humans-stupid-discovered.html,2014,"The Reality Television virus, never before observed in healthy people, was found to affect cognitive functions including visual processing and spatial awareness.
Scientists at Rupert Hodgkins Medical School and the University of South Carolina stumbled upon the discovery when they were undertaking an unrelated study on Reality TV.
Surprisingly, the researchers found that watching reality TV shows turns you into a vegetable or alternatively a moronic imbecile with an intelligence level lower than a stone.
Dr Mulrone Yokem, a virologist who led the original study, said: “This is a striking example showing that the ‘innocuous’ reality of the reality TV glut has irreparably adjusted human existence for eternity destroying its capabilities for intelligent thought.
“Watching any shows with the likes of Simon Cowell or any other similar reality program will devolve your brain to the level of an amoeba. You’ll be so fucking stupid afterwards that your brain will literally ooze out of your ears. We named the virus after Simon Cowell himself, who is a very important phenomenon in the reality tv world, it’s called C-NTU”
Of the 90 participants in the study, 40 tested positive for the reality TV virus. Those who tested positive performed worse on tests designed to measure the speed and accuracy of visual processing. They also achieved lower scores in tasks designed to measure attention.
The findings of this research show that mainly stupid people are attracted to reality television, but the funniest part of the research reveals that these stupid people get even more stupid after watching these shows they are so attracted to.
A source from a production company from one of these reality shows revealed: “We want people to be comatose. That’s our plan, the more stupid people get, the better. Keep watching, and do not bother thinking you insignificant toads, get more stupid, do not think, do not awaken, you must spend more money on us, keep watching, you’re lower than the dirt on my shoe.”
The study’s findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."

“Some of these women have fantastic hypertrophy buttocks 2m in diameter. This is an incredible place, can you imagine if some women adopted this type of buttock embellishment in civilisation? I just can’t stop looking at them, I, I ….” the diary of one of the explorers then trails off into incoherent gibberish.
The Kardashian entourage will congregate at the Mkposu river in late July where Kim Kardashian’s ass will be weighed, measured and painted for a special inauguration ceremony lasting four days. When she is accepted in the tribe, she will be given two huts, one for each buttock, and a ceremonial peacock feather will be placed in her ass crack.
“Kim will then have to walk around the village four times in total holding the peacock feather in between her butt crack, if it falls at any time or droops, this is a bad omen for the tribe and a great taboo. She has to be very careful to walk steadily, and must not drag her vast buttocks on the ground at any time. During this period, gangs of male warriors will dance around her buttocks gesturing for them to grow even more. Her husband will be forced to stay in his own mud hut and watch the ancient ceremony taking place. Only afterwards, will he be allowed to join her,” Khoikhoi tribeswoman, Gousu Gousu told the National Geographic.

Yeah, talkin’ about a revolution will do a lot. I go on the talkie kwalkie, or youpube, and I talk a lot about there being a revolution that should happen. But I ain’t gonna do it, nah, because I’m talkin’ about it means I want you to subscribe to my channel so I can make more wonga.

Anyway, I digress, I’m worth shit loads of money, and I want a revolution so I can lose all my money and the whole system crumbles. I’d be happy then.

‘Hardcore Henry’ vs ‘Video Games: The Movie’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/18642-hardcore-henry-vs-video-games-the-movie.html,2016,"Take for example online gambling, the odds greatly favour the house. When you know this you are in a position to adjust your gameplay to put yourself in a better position to take the house. Now that we have justified our comparison let’s get into it.
Hardcore Henry is a video game based action movie that was shot mostly in first person mode. Video Games: The Movie is a full-length documentary on the history of video games. Both movies are almost 100 minutes long. The length is the only thing that they have in common.
Video Games: The Movie is a low budget movie that cost less than US$110,000 to complete. Hardcore Henry cost significantly more to produce. It had a moderate budget of US$2 million. This is because Video Games: The Movie involves a lot of interviews of the who’s who of the video game industry. The entire movie is narrated by Sean Austin. Meanwhile Hardcore Henry has several actors and stunt people. Most of the scenes in the video game based movie involve special effects and special equipment including helicopters.
Video Games: The Movie is a special interest documentary which may be the reason why it only took in US$23,000 at the box office. Hardcore Henry raked in well over US$11 million at the box office.
Both movies have something to offer movie fans. Hardcore Henry gives a unique take on action movies while Video Games: The Movie is one of the most insightful movies on video games in recent memory. Besides these great attributes, it is highly unlikely that online video slot fans will be seeing online casino games based on these movies anytime soon.

There is a resoluteness to the British people the Germans just do not understand, and it seems they never will.
With news that MEPs in the EU parliament who voice their dissatisfaction with Brussels are now being  shut up  and the cameras turned off, we are slowly witnessing some of the totalitarian un-democratic nature of the EU.
To stay within such an institution of dictatorial imprisonment is decidedly un-British, and however you may vote on the day, Brexit must be the only correct answer to this EU tragedy.

As of yet, there are no concrete details about how the electric challenge will go but Croft has revealed a few bits of info that may sate the diet.
“We had to consult experts from America about the chair. It is an original electric chair used against convicts in the 1950s and will administer real electric shocks to the participants. Our legal experts also were consulted as well as the agents of the celebrities. The electric shocks they will receive will not be life threatening but give enough voltage to sear their hair and skin, so it is a serious challenge,” Croft added.
This year’s CBB has no one of any value participating, therefore nothing has changed since previous years."

Feminists don’t realise that the female body when in its prime is a powerful weapon and tool for women to get ahead and has been used for centuries for that very purpose. There is no leading actress today or in the past who has not slept with the right person to get the job. Men are easily controlled by the female body, and we as women have been taking advantage of that fact. It’s all biological. Men are attracted to the pleasing shape of the female body, and this biological attraction is utilised by women to get what they want. As for feminism, as a fickle celebrity, I was enraptured by the Soviet spirit of the Obama presidency and its peddling of feminism, which has sadly passed. Feminism is a soviet communistic construct created primarily by men so that there could be an increase in taxpayers and workers. Without housewives languishing in their homes all day, the work force, and taxpayers doubled over night. This is what feminism really is.”
When asked about the efficacy of feminism within society, the celebrity feminist answered in a forthright manner.
“Feminism within modern society has created many divergent outcomes. For example, today women are more stressed, they lose their hair earlier, they are getting more breast cancer, they are now dying earlier, and feminists have contributed to the destruction of the traditional family. Socialists and communists who created feminism, do not want functioning families to exist, primarily because it strengthens society and conservative values. and this is a threat to the socialist state. They would much prefer angry women postulating about their feminist virtues and socialistic prowess, as good workers and taxpayers who do not care to have a family yet may still breed future taxpayer bastards by the dozen different males they briefly use as sperm donors, or if you are true feminist, breed only a female through IVF.”
Ms. Watson was also asked about feminist values regarding men opening doors for them, as well as politically correct niceties.
“Well we all know that political correctness is another term for censorship. By limiting the language allowed to be used by people, it is a form of control, it is also a form of censorship that limits human freedom and is the mainstay of socialism. Men open doors for me all the time, as a feminist, I like the power that I get as a female to have doors opened for me, and feminists may say this is wrong however I think this is the ultimate in feministic control over men. Some feminists do not appreciate a man opening the door for them and will shout down the male in question. These feminists are the angry man-hating ones who can either never get fucked because they are too ugly, or are the horrible ones, users and maladjusted schizoids with serious mental issues. I myself fall under the adored feminist mark, where I use my beauty to get what I want at every turn without exception, yet still am able to read feminist literature and understand it.”
The feminist celebrity was asked how many feminist books she had read.
“I like to read as many feminist articles and books as possible to indoctrinate my mind with clever pseudo political feminist phrases I can use in conversations to impress the fellow socialists I hang out with, or to put down impertinent males who do not pass the soviet feminist tests we give every day. Feminism, much like Communism, is a religion.”
Asked about the difference between feminism and lesbianism, the actress reacted quite abruptly.
“Feminism is a form of homosexuality, because it indoctrinates women into the theories of self on self love. Feminism in effect rejects the male patriarchy, it rejects marriage, coupling and it rejects love between the natural male and female. To be on the extreme side of feminism is therefore to reject all males and embrace only females. This is lesbianism in political form, and eventually leads to lesbianism in sexual physical form. Women are natural lesbians, and to enjoy the gentle caress of a woman is implicit to feminism and true sisterhood.”"
Six Jobs George Osborne to Star in Porno Film,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/24813-six-jobs-george-osborne-star-porno-film.html,2017,"As well as spending four hours a week editing the Russian Evening Standard, advising corporate clients for two hours a week and getting paid £1.8 million for his trouble, and attending constituency workshops as an MP, the now very rich George Osborne, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, is also to star in an exclusive adult movie production filmed in Amsterdam later this month.
“I was having coffee in some bistro, yes, I do have time to have coffee. Anyway, this hunchbacked gentleman in dark glasses comes up to me with a heavy Dutch accent and asks if I want to be in a film. I asked how much it pays immediately, and he gave me a six figure sum. Not bad for half an hours work. He then took out a lens and started examining the groove in my nose,” Osborne chirped whilst sitting back recounting the the chance meeting.
According to reports from the Sun newspaper, filming will start soon, and all Osborne will be required to do is produce many of his famous  cum faces , whilst other actors do the sordid messy bits.
“There will be  fluffers  on the set, whether Georgie boy gets a sniff of that is a mystery,” one of the crew members in the production revealed on Tuesday.
Since leaving his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Osborne has made so much money he’s literally being drowned by it all. Every day, numerous bank accounts are filled up from his many salaries and pensions. There certainly has not been any austerity seen there."
**** Everything Prince Just Died!,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/18359-everything-prince-just-died.html,2016,"The heavens opened up last night, something big was moving on up into the universe, may have been little in the physical world but damn it Prince Rogers Nelson was a big soul.
Apart from being able to play twenty instruments, arrange, dance and compose some amazing songs, Prince was also a reclusive eccentric who was born into a time that made his music timeless.
From falsetto to baritone, this mutha had everything, and there will possibly be none like him ever again.
Prince was always on.

R.I.P April 21
Sometimes it Snows in April
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,
just after I’d wiped away his last tear
I guess he’s better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don’t pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain’t always the way…
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
and all good things, they say, never last
Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy’s tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy’s there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he’s found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I’ll see my Tracy again
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn’t love until it’s past"
Online Slots or Live Casino Games?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/17320-online-slots-or-live-casino-games.html,2016,"At first glance it may seem that there is less difference between casino online or card and board games. But first, let’s talk about what they have in common.
First of all, the general principle of showing the winning and losing combinations on the screen is determined by a random number generator. It affects the final result of the game. The general principle is as follows: the player spins the reels at a slot machine, while the number generator forms combinations on the screen.
In fact, those are computer programs built with special hardware. So what’s the difference? Let’s start with the advantages of Online Casino Games – Casino-X.
Firstly, you can play casino games online for free. Many users prefer to play online slots just for this reason. They prefer gaining any experience points during training mode before moving on to real money bets.
Secondly, online slots offer players best winnings. It is due to the fact that live casinos cost more than those that operate online. And, of course, online slot machines are available at your disposal at any time.
The largest modern casinos operating online offer customers hundreds of virtual slot machine games. Most sites provide an opportunity to enjoy casino slot games of several brands. So don’t be limited to one company: there are many small studios producing unparalleled casino slot machines with great graphics, increased theoretical return and maximum payouts.
The main advantages of online casino slots are obvious, so we will not talk about it once again. Still, the first step towards achieving better results is studying the general principles and strategies for the slot machine. Online slots that are used in online casinos have virtually nothing in common with their ancestors – the first mechanical slot machines. The current models are computer programs running on the basis of a random number generator.
Some users believe that it is possible to calculate the results for the random number generators, as they are based on some algorithm. However, the world’s leading experts in the field of online gambling state that it is impossible to guess the principles of random number generators of the well-known brands. Therefore, all the attempts of trying to “outflank the rival” are completely useless.
The rotating drums in online slot machines are nothing more than a tribute to tradition. Actually, there are a lot of new models with some other forms. But the majority of conservative players still prefer standards, so the manufacturers continue to create video slots that simulate the real slot machines.
Currently, the most video slots come with five reels, although it is also possible to find three-reel slot models. The symbols on the reels usually depend on the subject of the given model. For example, if it is Egypt, you will see the pyramids and the pharaohs. The auxiliary images may also include numerals, images of fruits and other simple shapes.
Each online video slot includes the theoretical return percentage, which means what part of the total amount of bets the players get. Currently, the best rate of return should be considered no less than 95%, although there are models with 98% payout percentage. Keep in mind that the majority of video slots can be tested for free before you start spending money. Good luck to all of you while playing online slots!"
Lena Dunham Playboy Spread Goes Viral,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/10424-lena-dunham-playboy-spread-goes-viral.html,2014,"“It was great, I got to meet all the bunnies and we showed each other our spreads. My young sister was not with me so I couldn’t do my usual exploratory spread check, besides I’m older and not so young any more. You see if you’re a liberal feminist you can get away with anything, like normal laws or societal morals don’t apply to us,” Lena Dunham recalled.
The actress and author even took time out to meet Playboy’s grandmaster, Hugh Hefner.
“He’s a great guy. He actually told me he was a feminist himself and displayed his trophy wife who is a very mature 23 years old. It was okay because he gave her five bucks and told her to itch his scrotum. Getting old is hard ya know, that thing hung down like an old leather bag and was touching his slippers. When I get old I want to be like Hugh Hefner, he’s the real deal. Feminism is great because we get to pick and choose what we want, like we don’t really want to do things like getting punched in the face by guys, even though that’s what men do to each other, equality means we get other men to punch other men in the face, or we can punch men in the face with no repercussions. I would actually get annoyed if a man did not open a door for me or treat me with respect. Yeah, so what if all the bridges, skyscrapers, massive engineering feats  throughout all of history were created by males? Us feminists walk across bridges, but we don’t care to talk about cantilever span or lamellar structure, that shit bores me to tears, I’d rather eat a cake and talk about makeup. Last I checked I was a woman, and so is my sister. Ho hum.”

“No, no, no, no! I watched the preview and seeing that chattering quasi albino with his fucking up tempo squirrel natter had me in fucking despair. My ears, my ears, I was tempted to stuff cotton so fucking deep in there I’d never hear anything ever again.

So what if that twat owns a few Ferraris, he gets his assistant to fill the damn things, this guy has no idea about the intricate nuances of motor vehicles and what makes them tick, he has no history, no fucking oil on the sprockets or the fine tuned mischief reminiscent of Last of the Summer Wine that made the show.

“Thirty five years is a long time for technological progress. We already have plans for Kate to either be encased in a nano particle fluid that will allow her to warble through a sound system.

If you’re a Remoaner, you are effectively a traitor to your own country, you support a German led EU Reich, a Marxist EU construct that utilises soviet collectivist techniques to take over sovereign nations and assimilate them into an EU Soviet Union.
If you hate Britain so much go and live in Germany. You Remoaners are pathetic weasels and cowards, you are the lowest form of sub-human detritus, you are lower than dog shit on a shoe.
Do not mess with Michael Caine, one of the coolest gentleman actors that ever lived. We watch Dirty Rotten Scoundrels in the Squib office daily, and we even have our own Ruprecht spot and a cuff handy. Oklahoma, Oklahoma, Oklahoma!
Sir Michael Caine was also great in the new Batman movies, until that Jeremy Irons fella took over. He’s not as good as Michael, and we suspect is a Remoaner, but that’s neither here nor there. Where were we? Ah, leave Sir Michael Caine alone.
Remainers are blind to what slavery under the EU means. They are completely clueless to the aspirations for an EU army, or the inhibitive rules and regulations the EU were putting on Britain.
You Remoaner scum would prefer to live in a slave like existence dictated by unelected EU Stasi officials. Are you brainless morons to want such a thing? Are you masochists? We all know you are treasonous traitors who would have collaborated with Germany in WW2, but your stance is ridiculous and is illogical.

“Like nothing touches this guy. He can do anything and get away with it. Any other leader would have been impeached long ago, but this guy gets away with murder, literally,” producer and writer, Dick Clancy told Hollywood Week magazine.
Without giving away too many spoilers, the action packed film starts with the president spending 15 trillion dollars on pretty much nothing, then bringing in a series of contentious pet projects that cost the U.S. taxpayer even more vast sums of money. The president is of course a mean shot on the golf course and is filmed delegating orders bypassing congress mid swing and consorting with terrorists. The film ends with a big shootout in a ranch somewhere Midwest, with Barry the Magic President walking away after executing hundreds of cowboys in a bloody stand off.
Initial screenings saw many audience members vomiting into their popcorn such was the sick factor of the film.
Teflon Barry the Invincible Magic President opens Friday nationally."
Mariah Carey Lip Sync a Comment On Today’s Music Biz,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/21587-mariah-carey-lip-sync-comment-todays-music-biz.html,2017,"The music biz and charts today are filled with fakers, and you may say this has always been the case, however now it is completely filled with fake, non-artists, uncreative, putrid thieves who are not who they say they are.
Long gone are the days of true artists, what we have now in the music charts are template black rnb lip syncing autotuned clones, lip sync girlie bands, performing monkeys on the stage, selected to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and soulless vapid merchants of turd Muzak fit only as background noise in elevators.
The proliferation of shrill female dominated autotuned vocals everywhere leaves the world encircled by the lovely sounds of cats being slaughtered slowly, an oestrogen bubble where the young males of today have no role models left. Sure, there are men who sing along to the male denigrating feminist vocals, but these are cucks, sissy boys who are not men anymore.
Yes, there are cycles in musical taste but for too long, the music biz has been embroiled in banal mediocrity putting out so much dire shit into the charts that the populace is conditioned to accept it.
Mariah Carey on New Year’s Eve exemplified how far the music biz has fallen, and it will fall further unless real artists, musicians are nurtured by record companies on a long term basis, and not just as cheap throwaways as we have now."

I’ll be their camp boss, ya know like Schindler’s List, the camp head honcho who likes nothing but to shoot from his mansion on top of the hill. I’ll be their saviour a Mother Allen.”
Preparations have already been made for Lily Allen, and a team of Romanian gangsters, people smugglers and builders have accepted her cash to build her a nice little box in the jungle, it will have a corrugated iron roof, and a solid mud floor.
“She say she wanna be one of us. We build jungle mansion for her for good price. She give us the money, it now in Bucharest, and then I transfer to my account in Lake Lugano, and then we present her with her shack she want so bad. She gonna love it. We even install toilet for her, it nice hole in ground. She will never see her millions again. Stupid cunt, innit,” one of the jungle’s camp organisers revealed.

Prince William Debuts New Hirsute Look,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/27162-prince-william-debuts-new-hirsute-look.html,2018,"The hair was specially flown over from Norway, then hand stitched for eighteen hours before being plonked on the prince’s bonzer.
It is reported by palace officials that prince William was getting rather chuffed off with his ginger-haired brother, Harry, teasing him constantly about having a head that resembled a “testicle”.
Although Myspace emo haircuts died off in the early 2000’s, the prince has said to have an affinity with them.
Royal source, Matt Pugin, revealed that the prince always wanted that ‘Myspace emo look’ even though he is now a 35-year-old man with a family.
“It’s like he’s harking back to a time when things were more innocent and emo. I have heard the prince does cry a bit, especially if he is on nappy duty.”
Will the public royal duties be affected by such an audacious haircut?
“Certainly not. His Royal Highness, Prince William can have and wear anything he wants on his head, as long as it’s not a plastic tit or silly pink hat or something jokey like that,” Julian Miles De Vere, a close friend and adviser told news sources on Friday.
Palace officials last year advised the prince to wear an 18th century style wig to look even more royal, however Wills dismissed this as “ridiculous”."

Once in, they have to fill their bags with as much binned perfectly edible supermarket food which would have been dumped anyway, and flee the area getting to a checkpoint designated on a GPS system. If they get there without being spotted by the cops, or ripped to shreds by police attack dogs then they get to have a meal that night. If they get caught, they not only don’t get to eat but are disgracefully peddled through the courts on some outdated 19th century law causing untold distress to the skipper and cost to the taxpayer.”
Supermarket Skip Sweep will air in March and will only be available to watch if viewers can get a log in code from a heavily fortified supermarket skip at designated locations around the country.
Key Facts:  In the UK 25 million tonnes of food goes into British landfill sites every year of which 15 million tonnes of this food is perfectly good to eat. If sold, this food would have a value of around £25 billion. The supermarkets call this a “surplus”, meanwhile 12 million people in the UK can’t afford to buy healthy food as poverty levels are rising daily. Citing cost efficiency, supermarkets prefer to throw away edible food that is approaching its sell-by date rather than mark it down in price as the cost of paying staff is greater than the money made on the reduced items."
Man is Entertained to Death,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/6236-man-entertained-death.html,2014,"Los Angeles resident, Bill Jimson, 28, was entertained to death after a prolonged period of entertainment police reports reveal.
Police officers and EMTs at the scene were so horrified attending the deceased man’s apartment that many needed counselling afterwards.
“What I saw that night will remain with me for the rest of my life. This guy had, iPhones, Android tablets, iPads, iPod touch, PS3, PS4, X Box One, Nintendo; hooked up was also a kindle book reader, a home cinema entertainment centre, a top of the range hi fi system, strobe lights and he even had a pc gaming system going all at the same time while he was still wearing his Google glasses watching about 45 screens. Somehow he just blew his brain. We found it in the corner under a pizza box with a half eaten pepperoni pizza inside. That’s when I just started gagging and puked on the man’s collection of remote controls and usb cables.” Officer Arnold Dietler of the LAPD recalled in the crime scene report."

“You muggles really are a bunch of simpletons. Why on earth would I write anything for that awful rag? I only ever wrote stuff for the Daily Prophet!

The Daily Squib editor for our newspaper’s spells section said: “Poor old J K, I actually don’t think she’ll ever get away from the Harry Potter thing. She really needs to go back and start writing some more Potter stuff. It’s the only way forward.”"
Hollywood Film Flop Studios Trying to Hire Squib Writers,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/4178-hollywood-film-flop-studios-trying-to-hire-squib-writers.html,2013,"“We gotta real problem on our hands. We’re spending millions of dollars making movies that no one wants to watch. That’s why in desperation we’re looking for some real movie ideas and have sent a team of executives to London, England where they got a newspaper called the Daily Squid, Squib, Squim..er..whatever,” Don Frankenburger, chief honcho for Miramar Studios, told Hollywood Week magazine.
When Hollywood studios are stuck in a vicious circle of remaking remakes of remakes, you know something is seriously wrong in Hollywoodland.
“We need films that engage the audience, less voom voom CGI special effects with zero story. We need characters in a movie that the audience actually sees as viable and cares about. We need subtlety. I know Americans need everything spelled out to them because they have no sense of subtlety but we need surprises — not the obvious shit that is around. We tried 3D but if a movie is crap, it don’t matter if it’s right there in front of your face in your living room, it’s still a crap movie with no plot line, weak characters and template special effects. We need new actors. What’s the point in having twenty new films with the same goddamn actor? All Hollywood films these days are shared between four or five actors, now that’s not only cronyism but darn right boring,” another Hollywood producer who lost $34 million on a recent film flop told CBS Entertainment.
The Daily Squib is readying the special writing room for our Hollywood visitors as we write this right now, just hope they don’t forget to flush after they finish the job."

Experts: Why Celebrity Fashionistas are all Dropping Off,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/7266-experts-celebrity-fashionistas-dropping.html,2014,"Experts in societal eugenics are not as intrigued as the common lay person on the phenomenon sweeping the fashion celebrity circuit at the moment, but have gone out of their way to analyse the data anyway because they were bored.
“Naturally there is surprise and confusion when someone in the fashion world dies early, but our analysis of the fashion world has revealed important data points which remove all elements of surprise. You see the fashion world is controlled by homosexuals, and their hatred of the female form creates models who do not look like females any more. To participate in this farcical theatre of hatred against the female form, the females participating in the fashion shows must hate themselves as well. During the unholy ceremony of misogyny performed by the fashion controllers, women are trained from young ages to starve themselves so they can look like young boys, therefore they can be pleasing to their fashion designer masters. Naturally, there will be casualties as many women succumb to the diet of vegetable juice, heroin and cocaine. Their hearts give away, but all is not lost as there are many other brainwashed self-hating women who are willing to bow at the altar of fashion death. Vanity, starvation, and narcissism are key to the fashion world and these tenets must be adhered to at all costs.There is no room for real women in the fashion industry or true celebration of the feminine form pleasing to real men.
“Mick Jagger’s bit on the side, and Peaches Geldof’s heroin lust are two examples of the most recent celebrity fashionista offerings to the altar of fashion death. They died for their fashion, and this is commended by the industry, but they will be forgotten as others take their place in the fickle, soulless, banal, plastic, positively evil fashion industry.”"

Tips on Painting the Parisian City,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/7020-tips-painting-parisian-city.html,2014,"When choosing which medium to paint the Parisian landscape, delve into your surroundings, as Paris is now a polluted traffic nightmare, you will not need oils or water colour, instead opt for charcoal sticks and a bucket of polluted water.
The canvas should preferably be a dark colour as if it is white, when you add the grey clouds of polluted air into your master piece it would invariably be tiresome to say the least. You will only need two colours in your palette, grey and dark grey, if you are feeling adventurous, maybe some black.
Artists have always marvelled at the quality of light in Paris, but you should discard this altogether as you will not be able to see five paces in front of you let alone the Eiffel tower. Forgetting the great painters, like Monet, Rodin, Matisse, Cézanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas will be an easy task in today’s Paris, as they painted idyllic portraits and landscapes of an altogether different time where even though there was industrial pollution, it was not half as bad as Paris today."

The prince has vowed to put his Nazi uniform down for good, and also will curtail his Southern Comfort sniffing sessions, as for wild Las Vegas trips, those will be carefully coordinated next time.
Palace officials were treading softly with announcements and kept quiet about the reunion. The royal engagement should be announced at the right time, probably when Russia invades Ukraine and World War III starts."

Did NSA Spy on Santa?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/4652-nsa-spy-santa.html,2013,"Billions of children around the world were said to be very upset today as news agencies reported the odious goings on by the NSA.
Speaking from the North Pole, chief elf, Dingbat Ringworm had some words to say about the sordid situation.
Angry Elves
“When I logged onto the mainframe to adjust some Christmas present lists, my cursor suddenly started to move of its own accord. Then I got an email from someone called Eddy Snowden, he said the feds had been spying on Santa. Not only that, the Christmas lists were then sold to some guy called Zucky, or Zucker. Now that dude sold the lists to marketers and ad agencies so the shit is absolutely everywhere now. Let’s just say when Santa heard about it all his beard nearly spontaneously combusted. Never seen the guy that angry since Frizwald dropped a load of Xmas prezzies last year when loading the sleigh.”
No More Windows 97?
Because of the database invasion, Santa has now ordered all his elves to write the Christmas present lists on paper. This means Christmas could be delayed by three whole weeks because of the mammoth task at hand for his little helpers.
“It looks like we have to go back to the bad old days huh. I don’t even know if we have enough paper to write it all up. Thank you NSA, You just made our lives a lot harder,” another disgruntled elf told the Elven Times."

I thought I had millions in the bank but when my accountant told me I had $6.50 left after all the recording, video, management, marketing, touring expenses had been taken out I realised I had been taken for a fool. It’s the music biz — a shit business. I’m doing fine here though. I don’t miss anything,” Harry Styles said during a special report.

“We’re really excited for Phyllis, oh sorry we mean Phil, he’s such a darling, he has even brought his own poodle with him and will be educating audiences on the benefits of anal sex for men,” A&E producer Andre Lamont told Entertainment Weekly.
The reality show star was forced to enter an Obamacare Re-Education Center in Los Angeles last week after he dared point out the fact that straight men do not like having sexual intercourse with other men’s anuses and prefer the female vagina.
“It is illegal in the United States to prefer a woman’s vagina over a man’s anus. This was atrocious behaviour and to even talk about it in a magazine contravenes free speech. That’s why we shut the man’s show down and ordered him to be gayer for the Obama nation we are under right now,” an A&E spokesman, Lamar Durtbutte told CNN.
Phil Robertson, had a few words to say about his new look: “I would like to say to my fans of the show, er…I’m a rehabilitated person, I am sorry I said those things, you know about men preferring women’s parts to some guy’s hairy smelly butt hole. I used to think that the butt was biologically designed for only pooing out of, but now I know that was wrong. You know after my time at the Obamacare re-education camp, I was whipped into submission by a Catholic priest, especially after they said they would take away all my money. I had to do what I had to do. Now bend over Binky, I gotta present for you and it ain’t a marshmallow.”
The new Ducky Dynasty format will be held in a beauty parlour where the boys will talk about the latest fashions in cammo, they will be giving some GLAAD activists and Obama voters styling tips on how to oil and perfume your beard whilst out ducky hunting in bars and show audiences how to dress right when going to saunas. Filmed in San Francisco, Ducky Dynasty has been a huge ratings hit in the city and the mayor is even planning putting up a rainbow coloured statue of the boys bending over and looking over their shoulders in anticipation."

Coming in at a mere 1,150 bhp this 1987 Golf Mk2 would make Jeremy Clarkson’s arse fall out of his gawping mouth when it accelerates to 240km/hr in 3.2 seconds, and this is why Frau Merkel has ordered Boba to build a fleet of these things in the interests of German phone privacy.
“Angela saw my video and was immediately on the phone to me. She said she wanted one of these cars to drive around in when making important calls. This way the NSA won’t be able to get a fix on her signal. Absolute genius idea, and of course for national security, how could I refuse,” Boba said from his lock up garage in Munich.
Somehow, texting while driving this monster around may be a serious, no, no."

Mr Moore arrived at City Hall by two pm and started mingling with the protestors.
“He was saying that he wanted to give away all his millions to us, and he wanted to join us, when he suddenly started sniffing around, you know, like a dog or something. Well, I was close to his stomach and I heard a big rumbling sound, and I knew it was time to get outta there,” recalled, one of the protesters.
According to Mr Moore’s feeder, when he gets hungry, they have to feed him a whole side of beef and 120 cheeseburgers. If Mr Moore is not fed on time, the consequences can be devastating.
“He will literally eat anything in his path, such is his hunger and gluttony. If you hear that boy grumbling, you better get the f * ck out of dodge, pronto. I seen him eat an old lady’s pooch in three gulps,” Eduardo Malcontent, who is Mr Moore’s long suffering personal assistant told CNN.
Witnesses at the protest camp site say that Mr Moore was sweating very heavily and he was salivating. Kitchen volunteers tried to bring him some organic lentil soup, but he tossed it to the side, then grabbed the young man and the rest is too horrible to write about.
“It took 34 officers to take Mr Moore away, and they had to muzzle him because he was gnashing his teeth like a rabid dog,” an EMT worker at the scene recalled.
Paul Strathe, a volunteer at the camp told of his guilt at his friend’s death: “I feel bad, because I could’ve saved my buddy. If only I had given Mr Moore pizza instead of lentil soup, he wouldn’t have eaten Jason and everything would still be fine.”"

Lady GaGa Left 'Custard' in Hotel Bath,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3133-lady-gaga-left-custard-in-hotel-bath.html,2012,"Lady Gaga allegedly left “large amounts of lumpy custard” in a hotel bath.
The eccentric singer reportedly shocked staff when she checked out of London’s lavish five star Regency Continental Hotel last August and they discovered a pool of lumpy steaming custard with an assortment of delicious traditional English desserts and cakes in the tub.
One housekeeper claimed the pop superstar was “bathing in custard and cakes as part of a Satanic baking ritual”.
She told BBC 6 news channel: “Lady Gaga left large amounts of lumpy custard and dessert in the suite during a stay this summer. The incident was reported to the concierge, who was told to put it out of her mind.”
GaGa was said to be indulging in such delights as Lardy Cake, Spotted Dick, Bread and Butter Pudding, Figgy Dowdy, as well as copious amounts of freshly made English crumpets.
Other sources believe Gaga could have been using the delicious desserts as part of a “weird” stage costume or prop.
An insider said: “All of the hotel’s staff are convinced she was bathing in it or, at the very least, using it as part of one of her new costumes or weird stage routines. It is also possible that GaGa likes a bit of pudding and is an English dessert aficionado.”
The hotel claimed that the clean-up bill amounted to £23,000 not including replacing the furniture, carpets and bathroom.

Kerry Katona Cocaine Day Loan Ad Banned,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3991-kerry-katona-cocaine-day-loan-ad-banned.html,2013,"Ms Katona, who promoted frozen food retailer Iceland whilst snorting copious amounts of cocaine, talked about her former “cocaine troubles” in the TV ad. She was declared bankrupt in 2008 after sniffing up half of Peru with her fat bloated pig-like nostrils.
The ad for the Cartagena Ad Agency, trading as Coke Lady, drew 43,654 complaints that it was irresponsible because it focused on Ms Katona’s cocaine sniffing problems and encouraged people in similar situations to borrow money at ridiculously high interest rates to buy more cocaine.
The ad featured Katona saying: “We’ve all had money troubles at some point, especially when you can’t pay your dealer. You could see your bank and fill in loads of forms, give your dealer a blowjob for a few grams, nick something and sell it, but there is an easier way to get a loan … So if you need extra cash for a snoot go to http://www.cokelady.co.uk. Fast cash for fast coke.”
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) also challenged whether the advert was misleading and irresponsible because it promoted itself as an alternative to banks while offering an APR in excess of 8,000pc.
Coke Lady said Ms Katona was selected for the ad because she is utterly brainless, deficient of intelligence and is an irresponsible bat-shit crazy moron who puts her kids in danger with her every action.
It said its loans were limited to £300 and were aimed at those experiencing relatively low-level short-term financial difficulties with paying for hard drugs.
Ms Katona featured in the Daily Telegraph’s Money Fame & Fortune series in January, saying she was reformed from her days of profligate spending.
She said: “In a way I was glad I got made bankrupt because it got my dealer off my back but then I..I..got this ad job and I’m in the same old shitty mess again. Sniff, sniff.”"

Local taxi driver Seamus O’Riordan was at the scene and commented on the Equalities Minister’s parking skills: “ There is a tendency to suggest that women are not very good at parking because it has been  proven scientifically  that their spatial awareness is less effective than men, but after seeing Harriet Harperson, I have to agree fully with that theory. You could have got a bloody bus into that space. Is it no wonder that there are no female Grand Prix drivers out there? She’s a danger to other car users on the road.”
Staunch feminist, Harriet Harperson has now called for all men to be stripped of their vehicles as a form of emasculation so that the roads can only be populated by female drivers.
“A man’s car is just an extension of their penis. If the government takes away their boy racer cars, then we women would have more room to park our cars and I wouldn’t need a shameful half an hour to park the damn thing. Come on sisters, let us come together to free the roads up from these chauvinist pigs so we can park in peace,” Harriet Harperson said angrily.
The Shadow Equalities minister will return immediately to mainland Britain tomorrow and and has vowed to petition parliament to ban all males from owning or driving a car."

“I went to see this film and thought it was awful, especially the part where the concubine was ordered to clean her master’s balls before a press conference. I mean, did they have to show that? Was it really necessary?” a shocked cinema-goer at a test screening revealed yesterday.
Thankfully  ‘Farewell My Little Concubine’ will be scheduled for general release in 2035 or maybe never."
New BBC Celebrity Retirement Home Unveiled,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3992-new-bbc-celebrity-retirement-home-unveiled.html,2013,"“You may be wondering where all your favourite BBC personalities from the sixties and seventies go to when they retire. Well, with a little help from TV licence payers and Her Majesty’s Pleasure here it is..da, da-a-a!!” a BBC spokesman said at the unveiling ceremony.
The state of the art building has all the mod cons, 180 foot high walls, barbed wire, armed guards and each retired BBC male personality gets their own special room which has bars on the windows and a heavy steel door that needs a special key.
“We put them in their special retirement rooms and keep them there for 23 hours in the day. They do get to watch a little TV of course, we pipe through re-runs of the shows they were in when they were at the height of BBC fame. We serve them some hot slop, usually porridge, and they get a bucket for their ones and twos,” one of the wardens, Ron Barker revealed.
A newly arrived retiree was rather jovial about his BBC retirement home: “I tried really hard to get that gig for her Majesty at the Palladium in the Seventies but my jokes just coudn’t cut it, but it seems I’m right here now at Her Majesty’s Pleasure..anything else would just be nonce sense..”"
Fergie to Star in Remake of Midnight Express,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3148-fergie-to-star-in-remake-of-midnight-express.html,2012,"According to her agent, the Duchess is very excited about the role and will even spend a whole year in a Turkish prison to see what it’s really like.
Speaking at a hotel along the Bospherus, she said: “Well, I’ve been in a Turkish bath once before, and I’ve been to a few Turkish orphanages, but the thought of going to a Turkish prison really excites me. I wonder if the cell has room for all of my Louis Vuitton bags?”
Because of Fergie’s desperation for funds, especially with a £6.5 million credit card bill she can’t possibly ever pay back, she jumped at the chance to star in the film when there were no other takers.
Turkish prisons are said to be some of the worst in the world, and the original Midnight Express film depicted scenes of torture, brutality and deprivation that has coloured the view of Turkey’s human rights record ever since.
Oliver Stone, who wrote the original screenplay, has been drafted in for the remake, but director Alan Parker will give it a miss this time instead, director Eli Roth has stepped into his boots.
“Sticking Fergie into a Turkish prison has been the wish of many people, especially some prominent members of the royal family, mentioning no names, of course,” a palace aide told the Times."
New Antony Worrall Thompson Game Out,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3152-new-antony-worrall-thompson-game-out.html,2012,"The new Grand Theft Tesco game will star the daring chef pilfering a bit of cheddar and a cheap bit of plonk from a Tesco store.
“That’s pretty much the premise of the whole game, he hijacks a few Tesco baskets, negotiates around some crazed Tesco security men, then tries to run out of the door without getting caught,” games developer, Roquefort Star Games told PS3 Today magazine.
‘Every little helps!’ as they say, and when you shove a bit of brie into your chef trousers whilst dodging a camambert weilding granny or two, you know you’re living in the fast lane.
People will be queuing all of Sunday night around the country for the release of the game first thing on Monday morning.
Game enthusiast, Mitch Warner, 48, said: “I’ve had a sneak peak at the game and just seeing Worral Thompson nicking those cheddars in broad daylight like that, it’s just so f * cking dairy. If I don’t get this game tomorrow, I’m going to have an emmental breakdown!”
Tesco profits were hit on Friday with a 15% drop, and CEO, Ronnie Stilton, blamed “That thieving bastard Worrall Thompson for the amount of cheese he’s pilfered over the years. “

Not since British former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown’s resignation have there been such scenes of utter despair amongst a population.
The much anticipated publication of the North Korean edition of the Daily Squib had unfortunately been thwarted by a communist party censor deeming the whole newspaper a danger to the state.
“I was waiting to read the first edition. We were waiting for ten years. Every day, they say you can read the Daily Squib, then the next day they say it come tomorrow, then the next day they say we have to wait one more week. How much longer do we have to wait so we can read the Daily Squib? I can’t take it anymore, I’m going to commit hara kiri.

Are we meant to try and figure out who these people are?” Rob Joist, a bored TV viewer told the Radio Times.
The executives in charge of the new format are also confused about who the people on the show are.
“We actually have never seen these so-called celebrities before and do not know who they are. Someone from an agency just told us that they were celebrities and we took their word for it,” Henry Arsehat, executive producer for the show revealed.
Ratings for reality shows are so low now that it is very rare for anyone to actually watch the shows let alone figure out who the people in them are."

Without Simon Cowell, there would still be people out there actually singing songs,” Bobby Guccione, a former A&R man at Arista Records told Music Week magazine.
Cowell was recently in the UK to promote his latest talent D4NNY.
“This some deep shit. When I heard this song I knew the deep message was there. Anyone who hears this song will not be able to get it out of their heads for at least a day. That’s what I’m looking for in an autotune song however terrible or bad it is,” Cowell said.
The song has already leaped to Number 1 in the charts and sold a massive 23 records which is the requirement to get to Number 1 position these days.
Without  Cowell’s  influence the songs in the charts would now not be delivered solely with autotune. This is a remarkable achievement in music software promotion and has truly dominated all genres of music.
“There’s only one genre of music now. Crap. And I’ve made millions from that,” Cowell said from his multi-million pound yacht in Montecarlo."

Others were not so happy about the Daily Squib surviving the cyber attack.
“The Squib, Squid, whatever mate, when’s the new X Factor on, innit?”
Another Squib reader from Adelaide, Australia, Rupert Murdoch, said: “The Daily Squib may have survived the malicious attack this time, but wait until I set my NOTW hackers on them. Of course, I don’t know anything about hacking, nah, not me.”
A spokesman for internet giant google said: “One of the best sites on the internet(s) was infected with the lurgy today, we don’t mean Google, we mean the Daily Squib of course. Thankfully they’ve flushed the vile bit of code out that infected their script and readers are now free to view the site.

Musical directors from the UK in charge of Britain’s singing contestants have now come up with a cunning plan to maybe alter the political voting a little bit.
“It’s not just a question of Greece giving Cyprus 12 points, and vice versa. If we put a super group together of the UK’s best artists of all time, we may get in the top five or you never know we could pip Romania or Azerbaijan by a few points,” Ian Templar, one of the directors of the UK Eurovision team told the BBC.

Ashton Kutcher Grounded,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3062-ashton-kutcher-grounded.html,2011,"According to Hollywood insiders, the reason for Kutcher’s silence and disappearance for the last couple of weeks is because his mother grounded him and told him to stay in his room.
“We heard she even took away his computer. Poor little bastard is now stuck in his room with only his books and a few toys. She also took away his cell phone,” Artie Rizzo, a long time friend of Kutcher told TMZ.
It’s not only affecting his social life but his work as well. On the set of ‘Two and a Half Men’ there has been no sign of Kutcher, and producers are getting anxious.
Speaking from the series’ studios, producer Hymie Rosenblatz, said: “This guy’s worse than that other loser, Charlie Sheen, why can’t you get reliable fuckin’ actors anymore? We paid this Kutcher dude bucket loads of cash, for what? He’s grounded you say? What the hell, I’m going to go to that guy’s house and ground him for sure, make him into friggin’ ground beef.”"
Americans Open New Socialism Theme Park,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/6324-americans-open-new-socialism-theme-park.html,2014,"Built in America’s heartland the American Socialism Theme Park welcomes all Americans for fun filled sombre times.
The desolate socialist landscape extends over America, and ever since Barack Obama came into power, the effects of socialism have seen a drastic reduction in the quality of life for the everyday American; this has been meticulously reproduced in the newly built ‘Socialism Theme Park’ situated just a short ride from I-94, fifth exit, northbound.
The socialist theme park’s warden, Karl Jenkem explains what attendees can expect when taking the whole family to the theme park:
“When you walk through the gates of the Socialism Theme Park, you are immediately told to empty all the money and any items of value you may have on your person into a black plastic bag by a man wearing an Obama clown mask. These items are then kept never to be seen again. Revellers are then told to undress completely, given special theme park uniforms and ordered to join a massive queue stretching for miles. Once they get to the front of that queue they are told to join another queue which is even longer. Do not be alarmed, there is one Obamacare doctor per 40,000 theme park attendees, so if you faint or fall down during the queuing session which may take days, you will be taken to a makeshift tent and refused medicine because it’s too expensive. If you have any complaints, you will be issued a free Obamaphone where you can protest as much as you want, but there will be no answer at the end of the line.
“Throughout the extended queuing process masked ‘Knockout’ gangs of young people will be deployed to randomly knock out any theme park attendee that either doesn’t look right, isn’t paying attention or looks weaker than anyone else. Beware, the thugs patrol in gangs and can appear out of nowhere moving swiftly, preferring to strike from the back when you are most vulnerable.
“If you get to the end of the second queue alive you will be shoved forcefully down a water slide at the bottom of which you will be told to sign away any pension, shares, bank account or property you own. You will then be taken into a dark room where there will be a sparse single light bulb. TSA officials will then give you a full internal body search and tell you that it is for your own good.
“During the exciting theme park adventure, people will be promised a job so they can feed their families. This will of course never materialise but hope is one of the many features of your time at the camp, ahem, I mean theme park. Please do not try to escape Socialism Theme Park at any time as the park’s perimeter is not only patrolled by attack dogs and armed guards, but autonomous killer drones from the air that can deploy missiles to blow you into tiny little charred pieces.
“Two henchmen will then appear out of another door, grab you forcefully and dump you into an even darker room with a powerful spotlight directed at your face. An NSA interrogator will appear from another door. He will tell you all about your internet surfing history, social networking data, smartphone conversations, financial transactions, what type of toothpaste you use and every minute detail of your life. He will then interrogate you to see if he can extract any more information from you that you may have held back. You will not be able to see the face of the goon interrogating you, but be warned, if you have any objections, you could be detained indefinitely in another Obamacare Education Center at an undisclosed location.
“In the third dark room you will be put in front of a screen and told to watch a gun re-education video. If you refuse to watch this, a woman with a Feinstein mask will appear from a secret door and start shrieking like a banshee, she will then put a gun to your head with a single bullet in the cylinder. She will spin the cylinder, then shout at you to pull the trigger. If you survive this ordeal, you will be told to renounce guns and taken to another room. If you choose to still refuse to renounce guns, you will be handed back the gun for continued Russian roulette sessions until the gun finally goes off.
“If you survive the third room, you will then be taken to a medical Obamacare area to have a tracking chip placed under your skin and you will be given a number. You will then hear an announcement: ‘Your time at America’s Socialism Theme Park is nearly over, we hope you have enjoyed your stay here, please exit from one of three doors, choose wisely’. What the theme park attendee will not know is that all three doors lead to one place, yes you’ve guessed it, a FEMA camp, a place which you will never leave — alive.”
Entry to the new theme park is free for all Americans. The park will be officially opened in March 2014. Please bring the whole family for fun times."

The grainy video reveals the animosity between the two after allegations surfaced regarding Tony Blair having it off with Murdoch’s power hungry ex-wife.
“What can I say she likes power, she moves from one player to the next. Obviously that was the only reason she was with me in the first place. I mean look at me, do you think any woman in the world would want a shrivelled old possum like me other than my money and top lizard status?

“I find it quite indicative of the nation’s view that Kate and William’s baby should be given a chav name. This is a major shift towards the more prosaic nature of the changing royal family. The mixing of the pure blue blood of William and ahem Kate Middleton has created an altogether common offspring. No doubt, I will be caterwauled for saying so, however the evidence is clear to all, we may soon have a chav king. I just hope his faux gold Argos sceptre and crown does not turn green in the rain during the trooping of the job centre,” the staunchly traditionalist royal historian, professor Edmund Feltham, from Grimsby community university told Sky news before being pelted with rotten eggs.

Miley Cyrus Faces Long Recovery From ‘Extreme Allergic Reaction’ to Dignity and Talent,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/7372-miley-cyrus-faces-long-recovery-extreme-allergic-reaction-dignity-talent.html,2014,"Her illness interrupted her “Bangerz” tour when she was admitted to a Kansas City hospital Tuesday.
Cyrus, 21, tweeted to fans Thursday morning that she is “over the hospital, read a page of literature the other day” along with a photo of her lying in bed. She added: “can’t quit crying i do not have one morsel of talent in me. i dont think i can ever go back on stage i am a shameful excuse for artistry and creativity … i need to get sum dignity and read a book cuz im thick as shit at the mo.”
She canceled a show in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week because of what was reported to be a severe pang of sudden consciousness of her bland banal lowest common denominator demented shallow brainwashed self. Her bout of self realisation may have made her ill say doctors, because she may have had an inkling that her crass untalented show is merely a tool for music executives to get very rich.
“Miley Cyrus was suffering from a sudden fit of consciousness during her tour in N.C. a week ago. She was prescribed a course of classic literature which she has now suffered an extreme allergic reaction to,” the statement said. “This type of extreme reaction can last from five to ten years in these types of cases of extreme lack of intelligence and stupidity.
“She will remain hospitalized and is under a doctor’s care until we see some improvement in her condition and is asking for your compassion and privacy at this time even though she keeps tweeting every five minutes. Miley is devastated about her dulled moronic existence and her lack of basic intelligence, she asks that fans delete her awful banal croakings from their hard disks and ipods and hopefully she may make a recovery from extreme stupidity in about ten years time…if ever.”"

“The BBC is great, even disgraced executives who were fired under terms of gross misconduct and fraud are given massive golden handshakes. And lest we forget the patron saint of the BBC Sir Jimmy Savile, whose depraved exploits were defended by the beeb right to the very end. How’s about the large International excursions costing BBC licence fee  payers vast amounts of money, you know sending a group of 3000 BBC employees to Shanghai for a Chinese takeaway?” a happy licence fee payer told the BBC.
One non TV tax payer said: “I especially love the threatening letters they send me every day even though I don’t have a TV in the house. As for the TV inspectors calling at my property at all hours of the day and night with even more nasty threats, it spices up my otherwise dull life.”"
Prince Charles Letter to Daily Squib Urges Restraint,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/7005-prince-charles-letter-daily-squib-urges-restraint.html,2014,"Prince Charles has penned another letter, this time to the Daily Squib, urging restraint in satirical matters, we can reveal the letter in full for the first time.
Dear Daily Squib,
One enjoys one’s awkward peeps into the nether regions of your site on the odd occasion, that is when the horsey allows one. One is urging you, the Daily Squib to please tone down the royal stuff as we do chuckle sometimes but we are..er..royal and you’re not meant to take the Prince Michael out of one. Lazy Kate and Ginger all agree it is a bit too much, as for Cressie, all this royal limelight is sort of off putting to put it lightly. ‘ere, if you stop with the old satire stuff we could give one of your writers an O.B.E, or even have them decapitated, oops did one write that? One meant knighted, not chopped orf, shame those days are gone as one would like a few ministers in the Tower with their heads on a stick. Andy Pandy says his Croation escort tires him out incessantly but the writing in the Squib tires him out even further, it so very tedious. As for mama, she’s a  trained assassin  as you already know, and if she gets a snifter of any more ridiculous satirical nonsense, she may get rather high in dudgeon. One must not forget papa’s wrath, as he speaketh with a very versatile forked tongue.
p.s. Please take that seal of royal approval down and replace it with one of distinct un-approval.
Yours Sincerely
Charlie
After receiving the Prince Charles letter, we were required by royal decree to always display the Royal Seal of Un-Approval on our publication at all times."
New Photo Dating App Just Yes or No Required,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/4159-new-photo-dating-app-just-yes-or-no-required.html,2013,"“All you have to do is tick yes or no to a photo of someone you want to shag, then if that person says yes as well, the geographic location data of each person is then transmitted to the users’ phones but not shown directly to the users and the app then chooses a safe meeting point and time. It really is that simple. You cannot write messages or anything else to anyone. After you meet, it is up to you what you do of course,” Anders Jameson, the designer of the app revealed.
There is no ‘maybe’
The new app called ‘Yes/No’ has come under criticism from many conservative and religious groups as they say it promotes promiscuity however the app’s designers say they are merely simplifying and speeding up dating. In these modern times this can’t be a bad thing.
“You can tell pretty much everything from a photo. Also we do not disallow pictures of body parts, because this simply indicates to the other user how fast they are willing to get to intercourse. We have seen a massive interest in this app, and on the first day of launch it was downloaded 40 million times,” Mr Jameson told Tech Zone magazine."
How to Have a Barbecue During a British Summer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/4103-how-to-have-a-barbecue-during-a-british-summer.html,2013,"It may be pissing down with twenty different shades of rain and the water droplets are so large they thud loudly and hurt you when they hit the top of your head.
Do not despair, the Daily Squib is here to rescue the situation and we will show you how to have that perfect British summer barbecue.
All you need to do is get the delicious food ready and you’ll soon be on your way.
The Daily Squib British Summer Barbecue Tips
1)  Booking a flight outside the UK is easy these days. You can do it on the internet or you can go to a local travel agent that has not gone out of business on your High Street. Once you book your flight, simply get on the plane with your food and when you arrive at the sunny destination of your choice, you can have a lovely barbie. A word of caution though, do not try and have a barbecue in the airport at the arrivals terminal or you could be in for a surprise.
2)  Wait for next summer, or if that one is bad, wait for another summer. This could go on for the next ten or twenty years, but the wait will be worthwhile.
3)  Moving to another sunnier country is not a problem, that is if you are willing to put up with the natives, and you can have a barbecue every day as opposed to only two days in a five year period in the UK.
4)  Have a wet barbecue. Make sure to pre-cook the barbecue meat first in a frying pan, then take it out into the rain and put it onto your barbecue.
5)  Don’t have a barbecue. This is the simplest way of dealing with the problem. Instead, why not opt for a ready-made meal from a superstore or better still, a takeaway curry with a few tinnies sitting in front of the telly. Job done."

Keith Richards is a marvel of medical science and has ingested more drugs than the entire subcontinent of North America.
The Rolling Stone’s personal physician, Doctor Louis Cypher revealed the secrets of the guitar legend’s longevity: “In the mornings we pump his veins with copious amounts of narcotics, we’re talking quantities that could make a herd of elephants drop dead.

"Cannes: The Silent Jewel Thief, Review",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/4020-cannes-2013-the-silent-jewel-thief-review.html,2013,"“Gadbois’s film is three hours long, and the only problem with that running time is that by the time I had finished watching it, I had been robbed blind. Not only had my  € 24,000 Rolex disappeared into the ether but the lady next to me had lost her expensive necklace worth a whopping  € 650,000. Even so, we all stood up and applauded as the credits rolled. What’s a little theft here or there, when you have such wonderful entertainment. We all felt as if we had participated in the cinematic extravaganza itself,” film critic, Rob Loutrec told Movie News International.
The Silent Jewel Thief’s plot revolves around a film festival where drugged  up  and drunk luvvies and directors, as well as producers, get so caught up in themselves and their projects that they have all their expensive possessions stolen from under their noses by an expert jewel thief, Guillaume, who falls deeply in love with one of the actresses he steals from. The film was funded purely by jewel robbery and even the director was robbed on the final night of showing.
“I’ve been robbed blind, but I made a great film. I can now go back home to Paris and be robbed by Francois Hollande even more. C’est merveilleux,” the film’s director Guy Gadbois told French news channels."

James Corden: Unadulterated Sycophancy and Praise Will Get You Everywhere,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/11786-james-corden-unadulterated-sycophancy-and-praise-will-get-you-everywhere.html,2015,"“If you’re a Brit and you come over to America you gotta lick boot, and that’s why James Corden may have broken the mould of the ‘superior’ Brit thing that got people like Piers Morgan into so much trouble, especially with the gun control affair. Americans love to be buttered up, and the celebrities just want to hear about their success all the time, something the Brits don’t do and it’s all too down to earth in the UK for the Yanks. Americans don’t want reality, just hosts that sniff celebrity butt holes and tell them how great they are. Like a shameless whore, James Corden is nothing more than someone who would not be out of place in a day time life insurance commercial or selling PPI, and he’s cracked America for that very reason. When it comes to dignity, he has none, and is testament to success in the field of effusive flattery for shit loads of money,” Renfro Grechtener, a TV critic told CBS on Tuesday.
All hail James Corden, an insipid, banal, now Americanised very rich sycophant buttering up the stretch skinned platitudinous trite over-clocked plastic celebrity effluent.

BBC Solution to Jeremy Clarkson Debacle Found,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/11762-bbc-solution-to-jeremy-clarkson-debacle-found.html,2015,"“How hard can it be? Car mechanics are technical people anyway and would be up and running on the studio equipment in a jiffy. If Clarkson wants a punch up he’d get a wrench across his face. It would also make for some great telly, imagine having a team of mechanic producers and Jeremy Clarkson having a full on brawl with pieces of steak and chips flying all over the place. There certainly would be no place for a cheese platter in that mess but ratings would shoot up,” Niles Pemberton, a commissioning editor who sometimes advises the BBC, revealed on Friday.
One other ex-BBC employee went as far as to suggest employing partially naked female car mechanics for the Top Gear show as producers, at least this way Clarkson may be distracted as would most of the audience and other presenters.
“Ratings would hit the roof. Imagine having a female car mechanic who not only talks dirty but can grease up the rod bearings on a V12 engine one minute, advise the cameraman to pan right the next whilst booking a hotel room, and smear motor oil over her chest at the same time. If Clarkson wants a steak she’d throw a frozen one at him. Clarkson would be sitting there like a simpering dog with his tongue hanging out in awe! There’d be no more nonsense from Clarkson ever again. It’s a win win situation for the BBC.”
Either way, it would be a sad day if the left-wing BBC killed off one of Britain’s eccentrics. That’s what makes Britain Great, its eccentric characters who bring colour to the drab socialist, politically correct, impotent, boring and turgid moroseness. We need more punch ups, more fucking life, more wildness. AAAaaargh!!!!"

“I got the idea when I went to my local bank to get a loan for an auto. The dude said no when he looked at my credit record, but check this, when I got down on all fours, scooted round his desk then sniffed around, he said yes and now I gots me a new Escalade.”
Word got round Twitter and Facebook and now people are crawling all over cities, in front of land marks, tourist attractions, especially in financial centres.
“We’re doing a crawl up the Eiffel tower, instead of two hours, it should take us seven,” Maurice Dupont, 18, a Paris student told Le Figaro.
The largest group of crawlers were seen in London’s Hampstead High Street numbering over 400 people.
Savvy online retailers are cashing in on the crawl craze by selling knee pads to go along with those selfie sticks for those special crawl shots.
Xian Chan, CEO of Crawl Pads.com is excited by the crawling: “We don’t just get orders from Hollywood starlets any more for those knee pads, it’s everyone. This is the summer craze to get everyone crawling plus it’s great exercise.”"

The film was released this week all over the Greek nation but no one had enough money to buy a ticket to see it.
Instead, it has been viewed across the rest of the EU as a cautionary tale about getting rear ended by a team of crazed leftist politicians gambling away the lives and fortunes of the Greek population for some naive utopian socialist paradise that will never materialise.
“I came away from the theatre with a tear in my eye. The film is about a crazy bald Marxist economist from Greece trying to give some Greek lovin’ to a German guy in a wheelchair. It just was never meant to be,” Elena Schwaubles, from Vienna, Austria told Euronews."

We’re in chaos and one only has to see the headlines to see this fact. Is it satire or reality? It’s very hard these days to see the difference,” Edward Mulrooney, the head of the government’s PR team cited in the report.
The Prime Minister himself has vowed to change the way people view the Conservatives and said this in a high pitched falsetto voice: “Swivel eyed loons? No, I want people to take us seriously. Did I just say that? Stop sneering at me you little oik, I want you to take me seriously, waah hah hah hah eeeep eep eep!”
Nick Clegg, leader of the Lib Dems provided even more lunacy yesterday when he told everyone he was fully committed to Britain staying in the EU. To loud guffaws from the backbenches, he was stretchered off to the parliament’s welfare office crying like a little girl.

The format of the Channel 4 show will be along the lines of its huge hit Benefits Street but will be filmed on an island where no one pays tax, no one works or does anything.
“This is an exciting project because it won’t just be one street in the spotlight but a whole island. You’ve asked me what island we will use for the program, well, if you can’t guess that then you’re frankly a bit dim,” Benefits Island producer, Edward Millipede told the BBC.
Benefits Island will be broadcast on election result day (benefits day) on 7 May 2015."

Madonna Grows Escargot For Gourmet Diners,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/7068-madonna-grows-escargot-gourmet-diners.html,2014,"The exquisite taste of escargot nestled in dizzying butter, that has grown under the armpit of  the world’s most famous female pop star is a dream to behold, as it sizzles in a frying pan in one of New York’s most exclusive eateries.
Madonna has been cultivating snails under her arm pits for some time now, she has a penchant for such delicacies, and enjoys the feeling of companionship only a snail can give.
“I love the crunching sound when I lower my arm. These snails feed off my arm pit hair and the little critters that live there. They do tend to grow quite large, possibly due to the extra nutrients I give them,” Madonna said at New York’s premier French restaurant, Chez Salope.
The four Michelin starred restaurant also pays top dollar for the escargot, not only for the star factor of the grande dame of pop, but the sheer size of these bags of slimy puss.
Head chef, Gerard Draino, revealed: “Madonna’s escargot is delightful, they are succulent and have an amazing aroma. Our patrons naturally pay through the nose, and we’re not talking snot, but oodles of cash to eat a Madonna escargot.”"

Artist Paints Canvas Red to Sell to Someone,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/6322-artist-paints-canvas-red-sell-someone.html,2014,"An artist has painted a canvas red. The canvas was propped up on the wall, and the artist daubed red emulsion paint over the previously white canvas turning it red.
“I used red paint to cover the canvas surface completely. The painting took 48 minutes to complete. I particularly took care to not let any droplets fall to the ground. I have transformed the previously white canvas to red,” Eduardo Mancini, the celebrated artist revealed in Art magazine.
The painting has already been snapped up the Gogassian gallery in New York and is estimated to sell for $850,000 with a few collectors vying to buy the piece in a bidding war.
Angus McFenster, 45, a carpenter from East Kilbride, Scotland has emulated the same style of painting but was less lucky with collectors.
“I went to a gallery with a similar painting of the art piece sold in New York but in blue. They asked me what my name was, when I replied ‘Angus McFenster’ they said ‘who?’. I suppose if you don’t have a name you can’t get away with it. Sold it at a car boot sale for a fiver.”"

I felt like I was in a world of cotton wool, where problems were far away from me, I rolled my eyes back and enjoyed the blanket of supreme comfort envelope me, protecting me from everything,” Robert Elswood, 34, a cinemagoer from Chicago told Variety magazine.
“Ten out of ten stars!” screamed Empire magazine’s reviewer. “I went into this movie fully awake. After I got up to leave, at what I thought was the end of the movie I just kept feeling the urge for just one more hit. I had to see it again, and again, and again. I am an addict. My withdrawal symptoms involved violent shaking, projectile vomiting, sweating and grinding my teeth. The slightest touch from someone would feel like searing pain, I was burning up and freezing at the same time. I had to go back to the theatre for another viewing,” James Brownstone, Empire magazine’s chief film reviewer said in his column.
Another reviewer for the New York Times said: “I need rehab after watching this movie. Tomorrow, I’m flying to Thailand to an exclusive detox centre so that I can get clean again.”
The format of ‘Heroin Alone’ is similar to Home Alone I, II, III, IV and V, except Kevin has now grown up and moved out of his parents’ house. He lives in an apartment in the Upper East Side and shoots up heroin alone all day and night. This time, he is good friends with  Harry  ( Joe Pesci ) who helps him score more smack by burglarising rich people’s apartments in Manhattan. The poignant part of the movie that will make you tear up, is the bit when he cleans out his parents’ house of everything so that he can get one more hit of heroin. Throughout the well shot cinematic film, Kevin is portrayed as a lost child looking for an answer and only finding it at the end of a needle. There will not be a dry eye in the house, just be sure to take care exiting the cinema you are in, as nationwide, film fans have been dropping used needles on the floors of the film theatres."

Entire One Direction Boy Band Eaten By Sharks in Florida,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3538-entire-one-direction-boy-band-eaten-by-sharks-in-florida.html,2012,"“The only direction One Direction went today was down the gullets of a some Great White sharks,” Ernest B. Cecilmayer, chief lifeguard at Miami’s West Beach told Fox news.
The feeding frenzy started at 3 pm Monday on Miami’s West beach. The boy band were taking time off from one of their mime shows and went for a swim.
“We saw them go further out into the ocean, and then there was some serious splashing going on. One minute they were there with their perfectly coiffed poncey haircuts, and the next there was just red everywhere. I just started cheering right there and then and punching the air in delight at the demise of the most nauseating irritating bunch of shisters foisted on what’s left of the music biz. If I could kiss those sharks I would, I wanted to shake their fins, to hug them for cleansing the world of crap. One Direction went down to hell in one fell swoop, they didn’t take the elevator but they took the water slide down there via a shark’s stomach. I sincerely hope those poor sharks don’t get a bad case of indigestion,” Cuthbert Eagleboise, a witness and music lover at the beach recounted.
A spokesman from One Direction’s record label, Syco Records, said they were very sad about the news and would immediately be bringing out a Greatest Hits record to celebrate their spectacular career in the pop world.
Marine Biologist at Florida Sea World, Laura Kiltner, said: “The splashing from the boy band must have attracted the sharks. We estimate there were three or four large Great Whites in the vicinity who must have been hungry because the feeding frenzy lasted for all of two minutes. Sharks rarely attack humans but in this case I think they saw One Direction and thought they might enjoy a little snack.”
The unfortunate drawback of the wonderful demise of the entire One Direction boy band is that there may be a few weeks of tributes on the airwaves, but thankfully they will be  forever  forgotten after that."
Cheryl Cole to Learn How to Play Musical Instrument,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3346-cheryl-cole-to-learn-how-to-play-musical-instrument.html,2012,"“This could take her years of practice and hard toil but she is determined to learn how to play the recorder,” her agent Matzos Wilder ,  told MTV.
The ‘talented singer’ has always wanted to play a musical instrument and is even considering getting singing lessons as well.
“It’s something that I’ve always wanted to do, you know become musical, like actually learn how to play something or even write a little ditty. I heard that there were singers in the old days who would sing without an Antares autotune machine, I might even try that one day, as long as I can still mime to my studio tracks on stage,” Cheryl Cole told MTV.
The MTV reality show will follow the starlet through her musical training sessions where she will attend classes with children as young as six to learn how to play the recorder.
“I’ve seen her, she’s good at blowing the flute, she told me she had a lot of practice. How else do you think she got this far in the music biz?” a very lucky MTV producer, Lackey Luster, said on MTV news."
Mission Impossible 6 Film Will Be About Tom Cruise Marriage,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3405-mission-impossible-6-film-will-be-about-tom-cruise-marriage.html,2012,"Speaking from the MI6 studios in Los Angeles, Joel Ephraim, one of the producers on the project detailed some plot elements: “Throughout the film, Tom will be fighting like hell to keep Katie Holmes married to himself so as not to reveal his homosexuality. We’ve also got a great cameo role for John Travolta, he comes in towards the end and it’s like both of them ride into the sunset together afterwards – oh shit, spoiler alert. You know, like Brokeback meets the Lone Ranger meets Hostel, or maybe a fucked up version of Batman and Robin. Go see the movie, it is so intense, you will fuckin’ love it.”
D-meter madness
Actress Katie Holmes will be seen escaping the clutches of Cruise and the Church of Scatology handlers from the cult’s compound in the desert.
“One particular scene really got me. These Scatologists are brainwashing Katie, trying to make her believe that she is in a regular marriage with a straight man, and believe me, she really wants to believe. They’re trying so hard that the poor broad is bleeding out of her eyeballs. Dangling used underpants in her face and shit. We got Cruise and Travolta slapping her around under an interrogation lamp talkin’ about Kretins and Klingons invading her mind and other such nonsense. Time is running out, if Cruise and Travolta do not do something quick, the world will know the truth about their fake marriages. Meanwhile, Kelly Preston is in another room getting the same treatment as Holmes. At one point in the scene – it was really quite poignant – Cruise gets a marker pen and draws a beard over her face. He just keeps shouting, “Why can’t you be like this?” over and over and over. She finally escapes, I won’t tell you how, but she is awarded a medal for lasting five years,” Ephraim said.
Mission Impossible 6 will be the defining movie out of the whole MI franchise, and audiences will finally see revealed, what they always knew about Tom Cruise.
“I saw the test screening and people came out traumatised. This movie needs to be seen, not only for Tom’s sake but every ones,” Mr Ephraim, told reporters outside the studio yesterday.
Mission Impossible 6 will be out next week."

She don’t know what she’s missing,” Cruise said smiling deeply, then jumping up on a couch in the Celebrity Scientology Centre in Hollywood.
After leaving so suddenly, Katie Holmes even left her e-Meter behind, so Tom Cruise now has two to use at his leisure.
“Sometimes I sit in a room with no windows and I think to myself, not only do I have as many Thetans as I want, but I now have two e-Meters. On my god, it is so amazing, not one, but two!” the excited star added."

When Bo Jo gets a snifter of beach volleyball quim, you’ll have to hold him back with brute force. He was off like lightning, first on foot, then a Boris bike, then a Boris cable car.
As for Vince Cable, he didn’t take the cable, he took the more traditional route of the heavily trafficked stinky roads in his Mini.
Well, no doubt the saucy hostess top totty in the cable car was a much welcome sight to Boris as he was lifted high up over London on the way to the Olympic venue in the new cable cars.
While Boris was getting his eyes washed with some serious eye candy at the women’s beach volleyball, poor old Vince, sans cable, was back in an unbusiness meeting in his car dreaming about telling bankers to stop all that banking lark.
Good on you Boris."

“This will be a great promotion for Obama’s gay wedding endorsement, and the Church of Scatology is proud to induct our two biggest stars into the  anals  of American history,” president and CEO of the Church of Scatology, David Miscarriage, told the LA Times.
The wedding is set to take place close to the American elections in November, and president Obama is keen to use the ceremony as a way to push forward his agenda and gain more votes.
“These are two huge Hollywood stars getting married here. John’s going to fly in from his ranch, you know he’s in New York one minute eating at a restaurant, and the next he’s getting a back rub in the Marmont. The guy flies everywhere real quick. As for Tom, well, he’s going to abseil into the wedding from a helicopter, or maybe his stunt double will. It’s going to be a beautiful wedding, there’ll be lots of auditing going on, maybe some Kretans might make an appearance, but I’m sure after the wedding those two will get their E-meters out and start whackin’ away like it was Penu’s birthday,” one of the wedding organisers told CBS news.
Other celebrities and famous people who will attend are Kelly Preston and Katie Holmes who are set to give the two newlyweds their best wishes on their special day."

The pictures were taken with a long lens when Pope Benedict was staying at the French chateau owned by the Vatican, a week before flying back to the Holy See to commence preperations for the Christmas period.
According to a report from the BBC Paris bureau, the pictures are blurry but the person in them is clearly the Pope.
“The Pope and Vatican are saddened that his privacy has been breached. It’s a terrible violation of privacy when Pope Benedict was simply sunning himself,” Vatican officials told Sky News.
“He woke up to the story this morning (and) has seen the photos, which were taken at a private hotel by a private swimming pool.”
It is reported that several British and Italian newspapers were offered the pictures, but all declined the opportunity to publish."

She was still wearing her stage clothes and was really hyper. She said she wanted to show everyone a close up of what she did on stage just fifteen minutes ago. She took one of her breasts out. Her nipple looked angry, like it was bruised up and mushrooming out. I just couldn’t stop staring at it as it twitched uncontrollably on her breast, and then we all heard a popping sound. Her nipple shot up in the air and fell down straight into a man’s Pina Colada. He said he wanted a refund after putting the nipple in his mouth with a cocktail stick and chewing it for thirty seconds. He said it tasted like an old salty leather button,” an eyewitness at the bar near Istanbul’s Taksim Square, told Reuters.
Madonna was immediately taken by ambulance to Istanbul General Hospital where surgeons tried frantically to sew the chewed nipple back onto her right breast.
Doctors this morning declined to answer questions about the surgery but Madonna’s spokeswoman, Joyce Green, said: “Last night after her concert, there was an incident at a bar for aftershow drinks. Madonna is doing just fine and will carry on with her tour as planned.”"
Jimmy Carr to Present New Reality Show ‘Jersey Off-Shore’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3398-jimmy-carr-to-present-new-reality-show-jersey-off-shore.html,2012,"“The basic premise of the new reality show  series  that Jimmy will be presenting is one of taking loads of cash from people in the UK mainland, then stashing it all in a place somewhere on the island of Jersey. Naturally, the person who is not caught by the tax man wins the reality show,” series producer for Endemol, Robert Anus, told the Sun.
Mr Carr will not only star in the show but present it as well.
“It will be me and a number of celebrities, including the tax cheats from boy band Take That on the island with our loot. I’ve got so much money that I will be pulling all my cash behind my Aston Martin Vantage which will be pulling a large truck carriage. I hope there are no large gusts of wind so that I lose a bit of the money, I don’t think I could live with that. I’ve even enrolled my dad to come along, the vile shit, he can pick up the pennies if they fall off the carriage,” Jimmy Carr said from his Oxfordshire mansion, worth £9.8 million.
Prime minister, David Cameron said that he would be looking forward to watching Carr in the new reality show, and it would give him more pleasure when he plants  even  more tax inspectors onto the ‘cu*t’."

Sacha Baron Cohen New Jewish Character For Movie,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/3453-sacha-baron-cohen-new-jewish-character-for-movie.html,2012,"“I’ve been making fun of every other race and religion apart from my own, so I felt compelled to get out my Jew cap and play a crazy rabbi who goes back to the Holy Land and brings peace to the whole Middle East by exterminating all the Arabs. I researched my story by going back to basics, hanging out with my friends and family, and especially all the studio executives, producers, money men and media moguls,” Sacha Baron Cohen told the LA Times.
It is one thing making gentiles laugh but another making Jews laugh, and that is why Cohen has pulled out all the tricks of his comedy trade for this new flick.
“I made fun of Kazhakstanis, Gypsies, Gentiles, Negroes, Chinese, Gays, Americans, English, Arabs, Muslims, pretty much everyone I could find apart from Jews and Israelis. OK, there are a few moments in the Borat movie, but this new movie is dedicated to taking the piss out of Jews. Of course, I can do it, because I’m a Jew, just like Larry David does it so masterfully. If any goyim does it, they are immediately pounced on. Oi Vay, This will be my masterpiece,” Cohen told Screen magazine last week.
The opening scene for the film shows Sacha Baron Cohen’s character looking up at the 120 foot high concrete wall separating Gaza from Israel. He then starts to rock back his head, back and forth, just as is the custom at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. This is the new Wailing Wall.
The new Sacha Baron Cohen film will premiere in Jerusalem in February 2013, before general release across the world."

Clearly amused by the antics, the 86-year-old monarch was pictured laughing out loud and gesturing with her hands as she sat alongside her husband during the event.
“The Queen loved every moment of this year’s events as the poor people were ripped to shreds by wild dogs bred especially for the event. She even tossed a hand that had landed on her lap back into the dog pit, much to the amusement of everyone attending,” Royal watcher, Albert Huntington-Smythe told the BBC.
Prince Philip seems to have made a full recovery of a recent recurring bladder infection and even managed to push an old man who had lost his home, children, business and pension back into the dog pit himself.
“What a wonderful recovery by the Prince, he had an oik trying to clamber up the pit, and even though he was a little unsteady on his feet still managed to kick the poor fucker back where he was summarily savaged to pieces. Huzzah!” a royal courtier revealed.
The closed event was a great success and will be held at the same time next year, albeit with some fresh poor people."

How about a chaise longue or an Ikea book case. You ever seen a GRÖNKULLA talk? You may think it incredible but even flat pack furniture has a personality. Actors Hugh Grant and Kevin Costner will be doing the voices. When I heard the voices from Grant and Costner, I actually thought that they characterised every grain of wood in those furniture planks. Definitely Clint has directed his masterpiece here,” Ed O’Hanrohanrohanrohan, a Warner Bros. movie executive involved in the project, told Movie Week magazine.
The film’s plot is a heavily guarded secret but without giving away too many spoilers, some of the scenes involve carpentry and a little sanding, maybe a little varnish to fill in the plot holes.
There’s also a cameo role from one of Clint’s favourite people, Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.
“I think Mitt stole the show. He’s like the plank of wood that was waiting in the West Wing.” another project executive said.
Clint Eastwood’s new film is scheduled for release in November 2012."

The Music Biz has been reduced to X-Factor people polluting the airwaves at all times of the day, and just when you think it is all over, more come in an endless stream of banal un-musical murder violating every pore in your being.
“It is not bad enough that these people have little or no talent, or that they are simply doing a mediocre karaoke act, it is the fact that these people have not one iota of originality, creative spirit or rock star verve. They should be strung out on heroin in a corner with blood coming out of their noses strumming on a f * cking guitar. Now that is art. That is music. That is pure creativity.

“Listen to ten songs from ten different artists in 2012 and there is no distinction in vocal style, sound or inflection. It is only after you see these so-called artists you realise that they are different people albeit wearing the same type of clothes,” a former recording executive for Warner Bros record company told Media Week magazine.
Well, it may be a sad end to music lovers in today’s current music scene, but it is a massive gain for the CIA.
A new Pentagon report has revealed that the CIA, based in Virginia, have found a use for the music of today — to torture Islamic fighters into revealing everything they know.
“We found that the sound of  autotuned  vocals going through the vocoder process is infinitely more annoying than a group of mosquitoes buzzing around your f * cking head at three in the morning. You put some Arab in a room and stick some headphones on his head, pipe this pop crap through them and you get results fast. Forget waterboarding, this shit works. We had that Dick Cheney guy in last week, he may be retired but he likes to come along sometimes, says it reminds him of the old days. Well, we showed him the headphone trick and seeing that Arab goat herder singing like a canary brought a tear to his eye. He loved it and said we should carry on doing more of this stuff,” a CIA operative revealed.
The CIA is now using the groundbreaking torture techniques all over the world at secret CIA installations where torture is permissible."

Holding back the urge to defenestrate as soon as I see a Hirst work, I am always amazed at the artist’s skill in quomodocunquization. One used to think Hirst was a contemptible barbaric rip-off merchant. I used to think Hirst was an aeolist. Oh how I was wrong about Damien. Seeing the formaldehyde cabinet for the first time, I rushed at it and waved my handkerchief over my head in abject surrender,” art critic for the Evening Standard, Julien Sewell, said in his daily column.
The new artwork has a price tag of $450 million and will be the priciest work Hirst has ever sold.

How’s that for living dangerously?”
Unfortunately for the self-proclaimed Queen of Pop there was a major malfunction by her assistant backstage because the word OBAMO was painted on her back instead of OBAMA.
Everyone in the stadium was in hysterics as they laughed and applauded the mistake, some even jeering and booing.
“Madonna did not know the mistake until after the show, and you can guess what happened then. The fur was flying and the air turned blue. Five of her assistants have been let go and even her manager, Joel Ephraim, is in the firing line. This is real serious,” a Madonna insider revealed.
This is not the first time the pop singer has made an ass of herself and it probably won’t be the last."

“This video is the best music video of all time. Take all of history then add the future, divide by 3.6 then multiply by lateral time scales and you will get this video in all of the multiple dimensions of time and f*cking space,” Edward Realtor, 34, one of the people who voted for the video said on You Tube.
Music video director Spike Jonze also agreed: “I had to just bow down to this video, I mean who needs Christopher Walken skipping around a screen to some DJ’s sampled music, when you can have the genius of Antoine Dobson auto-tuned, interspersed with wonderful editing and hilarious ballet pieces. It was just so black and white, so wonderful it made me cry.”
The 2010 production of Bed Intruder has amassed millions of views across the internet and for an independent production it is a work of pure genius."

“I need to be taken seriously all the time. Here, look at my curves, they’re all about that proportional representation(s) or summink I read. I’m good at politics, like I will debate for hours and hours about what eye shadow to wear and how thin my thong should be. Let’s discuss my new photo shoot. Do you think I was pouting enough as I showed off my taut, well toned body to all the men, who will no doubt got their knobbers out and stick the magazine pages together? No, seriously, I want to be taken seriously. How about a bit of legislation? I want to write a white paper about something or rather, maybe a pink paper, or how’s about a red paper with green polka dots.

The six Hate Clerics will all have a team of lawyers on hand at all times racking up vast bills for the British taxpayer.
“After doing the first episode of the show I actually got offers from Brussels as a spokesman for Hate Cleric rights. I turned it down however as the expenses package was not good enough. I prefer to stay in the UK and live the life of Riley,” Abu Hamid, a celebrated Hate Cleric from Bolton said from his luxurious room in the reality show house.

Dumbed Down Science Programs Made My Brain into Mush,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2690-dumbed-down-science-programs-made-my-brain-into-mush.html,2011,"“Astronomical shows revealing the wonders of the universe are now prevalent on the BBC. In a concerted effort to bring science to the masses, the BBC is paying celebrity scientists vast sums of taxpayers money to travel to hundreds of locations around the world and speak with very simple lingo in a condescending faux empathetic manner about the universe whilst loud electronica music blares out over a dumbed down astro-comical c u m fest,” an old fuddy duddy from Scunthorpe, Jack Sparrow, 67, told BBC6 news.
There have been hundreds of complaints about the latest dumbing down exercise by the BBC.
Things Can Only Get Better
“I pay the BBC tax so that this jumped up charlatan can ponce around the world and have an extended poseur holiday as well as get paid for it? You must be joking,” retired colonel, John Mathers, from Gloucestershire, complained on last week’s Radio 4, Your Voice program.
And it’s  not  just the  elderlies  who are complaining, what about the legitimate scientists?
Professor Harold Jenkem from Oldham University said: “I’ve watched these supposed science programs from the BBC purportedly talking about the universe. All I saw was some prat calling himself professor Brian Cock prancing around posing at every opportunity with flashing lights all around him and loud electronic music blaring out. Couldn’t hear a fu cking word he said, but looking at a transcript, it’s all elementary stuff. Why not commission real science programs and not this utter guff?”
On a positive note, maybe it is a good thing that science is being promoted to the masses, although, unfortunately to do this, it must first be dumbed down to a standard that borders upon levels that are offensively cretinous.
Here are some excerpts from the show, so you can make up your minds yourselves:
“Observing the night skies with the naked eye can only take us so far on our journey and wonders of our universe.”
“Advances in technology have brought us crafts that can take humans on expeditions beyond our planet.”
“The universe is a vast place.”
“The moon is not as big as the earth but is smaller than the sun.”"

Britney Spears Mimes in the Shower as Well as Stage,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2021-britney-spears-mimes-in-the-shower-as-well-as-stage.html,2009,"Britney Spears is so bad at singing that she has installed state of the art miming machinery in her Hollywood shower rooms so she can lip-sync to her hit songs which she never sang in the first place, members of her household maintenance staff have told US Gossip site TMZ.
“Not only does she mime on stage whilst performing to idiots who pay huge amounts of cash to her, but she is such a bad singer with no talent whatsoever, that she has now installed a state-of-the-art Autotune microphone system in her shower so when she bleats her awful out of tune voice in the shower, it just about sounds passable and in tune,” the source said.
Britney Spears who has modelled her career on lip-syncing, usually sells out concert venues with idiots who come to watch her mime to autotuned vocals.
Conchita Marin, one of the pop star’s staff told of how Britney spent $140,000 on the shower singing machine: “She brought in audio experts to install the machines that would make her sing in the shower without breaking the windows. Before, when she sang in the shower we would have to wear earplugs walking around the house, now it sounds barely passable after her processed vocals are put through the machines.”
“It’s like people want to pay huge amounts of money to see this fat crazy faker on stage miming to terrible music and jumping around on stage like a sweaty bloated marshmallow. I’d rather shave my eyeballs with rusty razors and drill bits into my ears then attend one of her concerts,” Britney’s long suffering dad told CNN yesterday."

The concerted celebrity initiative will be similar to Live Aid and  Live Earth , which helped fund a few African Ministers’ lavish lifestyles for a little while in the Eighties and later; as well as massage the egos/careers of the pop stars involved in the scam.
The fact that Ethiopia and most of East Africa never got out of extreme poverty and famine is neither here nor there, it looked good at the time and launched many pop careers off the suffering of starving poor black people.
“Every fart is a deadly weapon for the atmosphere, that’s why I use a plug in my arse and have the methane funnelled into a canister late at night. So far I have stored enough dangerous gaseous emissions from my arsehole to power 500,000 households for a year,” pop star Bono told the BBC.
Pop star Sting has already signed up to the new initiative as well as the likes of Madonna, Katie Price, Tom Cruise, the Beckhams and Jedward.
There are also plans for the gaseous emissions from celebrities mouths to be re-distributed and recycled.
“Most of the useless and dangerous gasses come from the mouths of the celebrities, in fact, their mouths and arses are pretty much the same thing, so there’s absolutely no difference there,” senior research scientist, Eduardo Paolozzi, told the Economist magazine."

This is Hollywood and it’s accepted as a natural occurrence,” Dr. David Johnsons, a senior consultant at Cedar’s Sinai hospital told Hollywood Weekly magazine.
The actress’ natural death is the third one this month, and is such a familiar scene to the Hollywood acting crowd that it has barely got any press coverage.
“We get one that goes, ten come in her place. We get fresh loads every day from  boonville  into Hollywood land all the time. It’s only a matter of time before they get used up by the machine, and spat out, then we get the next batch in. The acting biz is like that. It’s pretty natural stuff.

We have all heard so much about him. One of my darlings sent me two bags of fab Mcqueen jeans, so I tried out twenty-three this morning then settled on a pair of shorts with a black polar neck and my fabulous knee-high leather boots.
Last night I was partying with fellow socialites at The Grove, and we met the whole of Los Angeles’ fab crowd there.
My head still hurts from all the champagne and caviare so went to bed at 4am.
Fashion Genius
Liebowitz has pioneered ‘size minus’ for his models, so he has now gone one better than ‘size zero’.
His clothes are so small that they need to be put on with linseed oil, and they require three or four people to put them on the models.
The models are all starved daily and are only allowed two pieces of lettuce, two lines of cocaine/hour and a constant stream of cigarettes.
The Auschwitz look
My good friend Paris Hilton is with me as we are crammed into the Auschwitz Fashion Carriage, unlucky for her Tinkerbell her pet poodle is trampled to death under the feet of all the guests.
“Oh well I’ll phone mama up tomorrow, and she can get me a new one that looks exactly the same.” She then snorts from her silver vial and everything is better.
We arrive at the warehouse and the Fashion Police check to see if we are all wearing the latest designer couture and that all our VIP passes are in order.
Anyone with any individual and unique fashion sense is immediately turned away, with the assembled entourage no one is thus turned away, and we all sigh in relief.
The Fashion Police then use their cattle prods to get us into the warehouse, and we are truly wowed by the fabulous style and decor.
Dazzling Couture
Victoria Beckham who holds Liebowitz in high esteem says she aspires to his wonderful collection for her own burgeoning fashion house.
She is in fact modelling a Liebowitz silver creation for the Holocaust Show today and the crowd whoops with joy as she twirls down the cat walk not flinching once as her stick like ankle bone snaps with a loud crack.
She bravely completes the circuit with her bone jutting out of her leg.
Such bravery in the name of fashion. This is a badge of honour for being a ‘size minus’ model.
The other model I see is a bag of bones her ribs so extended that I can see her heart beating clearly through her emaciated skin. The whole audience dutifully admires her fabulous bone structure.
Nicole Richie is up next and her veins bulge in her legs, and you can see every sinew and muscle working even some of her intestines are visible.
The crowd gasps in adoration as she shows off the Auschwitz chiffon double-breasted gold waistcoat creation.
There is a tense moment as Ms Richie sways with exhaustion after walking 15 feet, but help soon comes quick as the illustrious designer himself picks her up with one hand and shows her the stage exit.
More Wagner plays through the speakers, this time the rousing crescendo of ‘Ride of the Valkyrie’. We are all awed as the final celebrity model comes onto the catwalk modelling the Liebowitz creation that stands above anything else in the show.
The gold tassels shimmer in the spotlight, and we are temporarily blinded by all the photographers snapping away.
Paris who is sitting next to me stands up and claps incessantly with her jaw dropped and her coke fuelled left eyeball jutting out with fashion desire. “I have to get that!” She furiously searches for her Blackberry so that her mother can order one immediately.
The aftershow party is truly splendid. A round of applause cacophonies around the huge hall for our esteemed hero designer as we are ushered into the party bunker resplendent with thick cast iron doors.
In the bunker there are shower heads above us but instead of Zyklon gas we fashionistas are intermittently showered with Chanel No.5.
We have our fill and the Krug ‘Clos du Mesnil’ champagne flows. At $750 per bottle we are truly honoured to be part of the gloriously exclusive celebrations."

The joke was aired at 7.23 pm well before the 9.00 pm watershed and no one even batted an eyelid.
“Over the last few weeks everything the BBC has done has caused a massive protest of complaints. Radio DJ’s working for the BBC have borne the brunt of most of the animosity as well as a few BBC employed celebrities. This time, a joke was uttered and there was not even a sigh from a Daily Mail reader. It didn’t even register on the radar as far as we’re concerned and may, in fact, hail a turning point in the BBC’s fortunes,” Alfred Scrotum, the editor for TV Weekly wrote in his column.

Simon Cowell gushed over her act: “She looked around, then she took that moggy and stuffed it in the bin. I was stunned at the enormity of the cowardly vile act, even I couldn’t top that one.”
Then Pierce Moron added to the praise: “Everyone knows I’m a lowly cowardly, smarmy, vile piece of  putrefying shit, but this cat woman really showed me up. I couldn’t top what she did either.”
The audiences of Britain’s Got Talent all voted for the Cat Woman too, propelling her to instant fame. She is so famous now, that SuBo is a distant memory, the only similarity being that both of them are short fat ugly pugs and as mad as hatters."
Mel Gibson to Become Monk in Italian Monastery,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2381-mel-gibson-to-become-monk-in-italian-monastery.html,2010,"He is known for his articulate way with the wonderful English language as well as his delicate oration whilst speaking to members of the opposite sex; his eloquent acting style and his impeccable manners both on and off set are a prime example of the qualities that we all aspire to. Sadly, all of this will be lost soon as Hollywood is to lose this great actor, known as Mel Gibson, to the Corborrosa Italian abbey in Tuscany, next week.
Gibson has already got his monk’s outfit out and is showcasing it around Hollywood much to the amusement of passers by as well as other Hollywood celebrities.
The preparations for Mel’s saintly monkhood are continuing in earnest with a contingent of monks even making the effort to fly out from Tuscany to coach Mel on how to be a monk in the monastery.
“For starters there will be no more smiling blowjobs in the morning from Russian escorts, no demands for self-worship and definitely no violence or cussing. I for one think it’s going to be nearly impossible for Mel to do it,” his agent told TMZ.
The former actor’s daily roster will consist of morning prayers at 4.30 am, morningsong at 5.30 am, then he will help either in the gardens or orchards for two to three hours; then more prayers and a spot of lunch. After lunch, the Monks usually have an hour of timber cutting work, at 4.30 pm there is an evening mass as well as evensong and then bedtime is at 6 pm.
The self sufficient monastery even grows its own food, and Mel will be eating such staples as stale bread, olives and fresh Tuscan cheese.
Speaking from the monastery, Abbot Francisco De Pacino, told the Tuscano Gazzetta, that it was an “honour for the abbey to receive the great Mel Gibson to the fold”. Already there have been preparations for the actor’s entrance: “We have hidden all the wine, even from the cellar. Also, our housekeeper, Georgio has prepared a special bed for Signor Gibson, there are thick leather straps to hold him down when he has his moments. Also, as you know, women are forbidden from entering the abbey, so Mel will be happy about that. He can be one with Jesus now. We also do not have, Jews, Negroes, Hispanics, Chinese people, Arabs and anyone else that Mel has not offended deeply in our abbey.”
Mel Gibson is set to fly out to Tuscany in mid august and has already sold everything he owns before the trip. He has vowed to dedicate his life to monastic living and has no more need for the material objects he has lost through negligence and divorce."
Celebrity Pope Urges Britons to Beware of ‘Celebrity Culture’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2444-celebrity-pope-urges-britons-to-beware-of-celebrity-culture.html,2010,"The crowd of 145,000 people greeted the Pontiff with songs and gifts and listened intently as he invited them to “cast away celebrity culture”.
He said: “You must reject celebrity culture. True happiness is found in God. Oh my gosh, have I won X Factor? Am I the next SuBo?”
Escorted by hundreds of police outriders, security vehicles, four helicopters, an armoured car and a team of surveillance agents he had arrived at Trafalgar Square in London, in a 185-vehicle convoy – revelling in his super celebrity status.
The whole of London had been cordoned off for the celebrity Pope’s outing, resulting in massive traffic disruption across the city with all airports  locked down.
The celebrity Pope, later on did a lap of honour around the route in his Popemobile, before speeding off with his whole entourage to his next celebrity Pope function in Birmingham opening a Tesco superstore.
The Pope will be releasing a new DVD box set of his tour and a new book to commemorate the trip."
Jade Goody Has Operation to Remove Publicist,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1690-jade-goody-has-operation-to-remove-publicist.html,2009,"The 27-year-old Big Brother star left the Royal  Sun Mirror  Hospital in Wapping, East London, in a wheelchair and was put into a waiting 
ambulance before being driven away.
According to Sky news, the operation to remove the publicist from her orifice was not an easy surgical process.
“The operation to remove Jade Goody’s publicist took all of seven hours and required a team of twelve surgeons. The publicist was lodged firmly in her bowel area and we think we got most of him out but there may be some residual headlines and sensational money making headlines still left. I hope for our sake we will all be given some rest from this awful publicist and his grotesque exploitative greed,” Chief surgeon for the Royal Sun Mirror Hospital in Wapping told reporters.
No one can be sure if the publicist was completely removed from Jade’s bowel, but as our reporter walked past the office earlier, a double-decker bus passed by with a huge Jade Goody advert on the side informing everyone that she is very ill and is suffering terribly.
Now all we need is a self gratifying smarmy interview from leech, Piers Moron, to add to the smell of effluent hanging over the whole sorry affair."
"""It’s Britney Bitches!""",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1695-its-britney-bitches.html,2009,"“Britney is amazing. She just ate 4 burritos, 6 pepperoni pizzas, 24 bars of candy, a bucket full of cheetos and a barrel of aspartame cola — and she can still come out on stage and do the moves. I don’t think even Barry White in his heyday could do that,” Britney’s personal fitness coach, Gabriel Finkel, told MTV.
You guessed it folks, bring out the Antares autotune and onstage miming. Britney’s back and this time she’s angry.
“Britney is eager to put the smack down on all of her detractors and the naysayers. She wants to prove to people once and for all that she is a talented star in her own right. The fact that she is so drugged up and bloated is neither here nor there, she wants to attempt to mime better to prove her worth,” her manager, Alan Hymie Weissman, articulated.
Indeed, for the last four months she has been receiving expert miming tuition from the likes of Jennifer Lopez, the Simpson sisters and all the other female singers on the pop circuit at the moment.
As we all know the music biz is awash with female pop starlets who have achieved their place in the annals of pop history by giving the right person the right head — just look at Joss Stone for example. Miming is now an established art form amongst the braindead silicon titted dolly birds who aspire to be big ‘stars’.
In Los Angeles alone, there have been ten miming schools opened within the last year.
“The trick is to actually believe you are singing the song. Only then can you fool the audience. You must exude the correct emotion as well as exaggerate every inflection,” Alanna Tomas, head instructor at the LA School of Stage Mime told the Daily Squib.
Britney fought hard to get back her true talent and is finally cracking the nut after literally going nuts about a year ago.
Although still clinically insane, Britney is kept in check by a team of attendants who follow her everywhere. She is also administered daily with numerous anti-psychotic drugs that some of her close friends and family have questioned.
“Sometimes her left cheek twitches so much we cannot take photographs or we have to stop filming. Her facial cheeks twitch sometimes as well and she also has a way of winking uncontrollably that kind of reminds us of Herbert Lom’s rendition of  Chief   Inspector Dreyfus from the Pink Panther movies. No, not the crap Steve Martin atrocities, we’re talking about Peter Sellers. If I ever saw Steve Martin I would punch that guy’s fat head very hard for defiling the Pink Panther movies so much. He actually deserves death for his awful, awful Pink Panther film. All the people involved in those Hollywood remakes need to be lined up and shot. Bloody disgraceful,” Britney’s personal physician, Dr Guy Gadoire  told MTV.
For what insiders described as her last chance to prove she can still 
compete in the pop mime world alongside other mimers like Madonna and Kylie 
Minogue, the singer pulled out all the stops.
The Louisiana performance, the first of her 44-date Circus tour, was 
widely deemed a success by her brainless amoeba fans, but critics were less enthusiastic, 
citing her lip-syncing as a notable disappointment.
This is Britney’s 23rd comeback attempt in six years. Let us hope it is her last."
Max Clifford Announces Jade Goody Funeral Extravaganza,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1718-max-clifford-announces-jade-goody-funeral-extravaganza.html,2009,"PR Guru and  suppurating anus , Max Clifford has revealed for the first time the intricate details of the state funeral that will be conducted for Jade Goody.
“Even Margaret Thatcher will not get the same treatment that Jade is going to get. The nation will observe a full day’s mourning and there will be a public holiday announced. After the pay-per-view funeral (ker-ching), there will be a horse drawn carriage pulling the open top coffin along from Jade’s home in Upshire, Essex to the Big Brother house which will be her final resting place and Endemol sponsored shrine. She will thus be buried under the building, possibly in the diary room in a glass coffin so successive celebrity Big Brother housemates can see the legend themselves. Jade is a legend I tell you. My yellow Lamborghini Murciélago LP 640 will attest to her greatness and astounding earning power.”
The funeral procession is expected to attract over 13 million people following the beloved celebrity star.
Because of the funeral procession and the number of people said to be attending, Burberry stores all over the UK have already sold out of caps and scarves.
“But you have to admit, it’s been a great month. Kerry Katona bankrupt, Jade Goody cancer…..mind if I have a good think about my last one Mr Genie, I’d hate to waste it,” Ernie Tarbuck, a librarian from North London told ITV1 news.
According to Downing Street, the Jade Goody procession will commence after a 49 gun salute commemorating each corporate sponsor that will be involved in the parade.
Dignitaries from the government will be present including the prime minister himself. There is even talk of Royal attendance, however the Beckhams may not be able to get to the UK from Los Angeles in time."
Max Clifford to Represent University Challenge Genius Trimble,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1683-max-clifford-to-represent-university-challenge-genius-trimble.html,2009,"Just a few years ago if you won Mastermind on television you would be considered a prime case for media fame and fortune but not anymore it seems. The British public are so  dumbed down  now that they can only relate to vacuous inept ignorant morons with no talent, culture or class. It is a symptom of base, vulgar and crass shows like X-Factor, Big Brother and Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, that has precipitated the disgraceful slide in any form of intelligence left within the British Isles.
“Licence to be stupid”
“To be stupid and moronic with an IQ of about 20 is now a British institution and applauded all over the media,” a TV executive for ITV1 told the Daily Squib.
After the recent win by Oxford graduate, Gail Trimble of University Challenge, she couldn’t open a Tesco superstore in Dagenham let alone sell her wedding rights for £3 million. That is until Maxwell Clifford walked into Gail’s brain and a big bulb flashed so bright that it even outshone the glare coming from Jeremy Paxman’s horse smile.
Clifford is set on getting Gail Trimble into the tabloid media’s bawdy perfidious stare and he has vowed to change her image from an intelligent brainbox to what is now the only acceptable marketable image in the UK for a female celebrity — that of a knuckle-dragging chav ignorant ‘ladette’ with no talent whatsoever.
“Once Max gets his grubby rotten amoral hyena claws into this new girl she’ll be singing like a parrot on Gazza’s shoulder. Gail’s going to be coached on how to get her baps out for the red-top papers and how to make outrageous ignorant pig-shit, brain-fart comments that will have everyone loving her in no time. The only thing is, she will need to contract a terminal disease soon after so that Max can exploit that to the full as well. I’m sure living the unhealthy  chav  lifestyle she will be forced into for fame and fortune will soon bring on something awful soon enough,” Jane Tamarind, a News of the World columnist divulged.
“Grief”
By commending the likes of Jade Goody and other reality show ‘stars’ the media is simply promoting the fact that to be stupid and ignorant is a good trait and should be applauded. Clifford knows of this base theorem very well and has exploited its capacity to the full.
“Max is simply thinking of the future. What’s he going to do once his Golden Goose is dead? He needs new talent and he is up for the challenge by representing someone who is not as thick and pig ignorant as his previous protege. Apparently Max has even been spotted walking round with a dictionary so he can prepare himself for the big words which will be uttered from Ms Trimble’s well educated mouth. Max is himself an ignorant cockney moron with little or no education so he will have to be on top form to even have a conversation with this Trimble woman. Soon he’ll have her tossing her extensive vocabulary and knowledge away and implanting vulgar crass words and mannerisms so that she can be a media darling like her heroine Jade Goody. You won’t be able to open a newspaper or trash magazine without seeing her face beaming from it,” Heather Scargill, a member of Max Clifford’s PR agency is quoted as saying in the Sun.
It is a sad detriment to our society that we have come to this level of repugnance exercised by the media where garish miasmal banality is celebrated and intelligent prehensility of the mind is vilified and discarded."
Lady GaGa Wants Her Leg Back,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2460-lady-gaga-wants-her-leg-back.html,2010,"MTV has reported that Lady GaGa is fed up of the cosmetic leg amputation she underwent in April of this year and wants her leg back.
At the time of the fashion induced operation, there was even a GaGa amputation competition held for a Lady GaGa fan to win her leg as a prize, but it was sadly shelved after protests from the public and authorities.
“I underwent a leg amputation last year purely to be different and for it to be a fashion statement. All my beautiful crazy monsters supported me but I am now bored of my amputation and want my leg back please,” the fashion conscious autotune pop singer GaGa told MTV.
The pop star’s record company is now having all her photos and publicity shots photoshopped to replace her amputee peg leg with a real leg.
Lady GaGa’s leg was kept in a cold storage formaldehyde solution and cryogenically frozen to prevent any tissue damage and will be reattached to her stump in a 56 hour operation conducted by the world’s best surgeons.
“We have a medical team on standby 24 hrs a day to reattach her leg. The problem is that after the leg finally thaws out, they will have to rush her to the secret location for the groundbreaking operation. This could be quite hard if she is onstage or in another country touring,” Ms GaGa’s press officer told Entertainment Weekly."
"Amy Winehouse: ""I’ve Been Drug Free for Three Years""",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2463-amy-winehouse-ive-been-drug-free-for-three-years.html,2010,"The singer, who was most recently addicted to party drug  woof woof , has claimed in a tabloid newspaper that she has been free from drugs for three years after attending intensive drug addiction treatment.
Her friends however have disclaimed her remarks and revealed that the new drugs she is currently taking make three minutes feel like three years.
“She doesn’t know what she’s doing because she’s taking this new party drug that distorts time. For the drug users who take joo joo, which is the latest designer drug in the Camden area, it makes a few seconds feel like years. You’ll literally think you’re taking three years to cross a road full of oncoming traffic when in reality it could be 15 seconds. By that time of course, you could get hit by a two tonne truck. When Amy said she was free from drugs for three years, she really meant three minutes. I’ve seen people going to sleep in the middle of the road thinking they’ve got years ahead of them to cross, but poor blighters get squashed like bugs under buses and lorries,” Harpel Owens, one of Amy’s long-standing confidantes revealed.
Government drugs experts have warned against the use of the joo joo drug which is actually derived from a byproduct of industrial toilet cleaner.
“Unfortunately, this new drug is taking hold of Britain’s youth, and celebrity endorsements from the likes of Amy Winehouse only helps to spread the word. It is a very dangerous drug that distorts time so severely that the user believes  seconds  are  years and hours are decades. We are doing our best to try and thwart the spread of this drug but it’s very hard at the moment,” Ronald Crowe, a spokesman for the government’s addiction treatment agency told the Times."
G20 Celebration Mascot Finally Revealed,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1729-g20-celebration-mascot-finally-revealed.html,2009,"Bring a bottle or how about a Molo cocktail or three for the best party of the year!
The carnival event will kick off at about 11am on April 1st so be there or be square.
Gatecrashers are most welcome according to posters posted across the whole of London for the G20 party of the century.
“We’ve got our mascot who is Fred ‘The Shred’ Goodwin. He’ll be paraded through the streets during the carnival and will get everyone up and dancing for sure. The finale will involve Fred ‘The Shred’ being put legs first…wait for it.. through  an industrial shredder. Now that’s what I call entertainment. There’s also going to be about 10,000 rozzers in fancy dress coming to the party, so get your brick-a-brac ready for the tit heads,” Andy Crusty, a certified party animal told Reuters.
Sir Fred Goodwin, who was in hiding until he was caught last week, will attend the party wearing a jokers outfit and will be paraded on a float.
The party and celebrations are planned for two whole days and may even go on for longer depending on how many buildings are still standing within the centre of London.
The ‘climate change’ lemmings will be in town also, parroting the exact rhetoric that they have been programmed to do by their controllers.
“It’s a case of how much overtime the fuzz want to claim, how much a good job the agent provocateurs do, how much partying the nihilists want and simple things like portaloos, catering and availability of weapons. There is certainly a great deal of fuel to be burnt off over the course of two days thanks to Gordon Brown’s policies.
“The G20 party is going to kick off at Moorgate, Liverpool Street, London Bridge and Cannon Street stations so be there at 11am sharp and don’t forget to bring some f * cking bollocks with you. If you come along early you may even be able to enjoy the delights of one of our party hosts,” Mr Crusty said."
Charlie Sheen Taking Flying Lessons,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2491-charlie-sheen-taking-flying-lessons.html,2010,"“Charlie Sheen always wanted to fly, so we arranged some lessons in a Cessna. He’s already had 30 hours flight time and is ready for his first written test,” Mr Sheen’s agent, Bernie Goldstein, told the New York Times.
The actor’s long suffering flight instructor recalled some of the lessons: “First we go through the preliminary checks, then once we’re up in the air, Charlie gets the booze and drugs out. He snorts on the dashboard, then downs about six or seven bottles of red wine, and by that time we’re ready to land. Last week he brought up two whores for some in-flight entertainment. Sometimes, the altitude gets to him and he has one of his tantrums. After a few nosedives and loops the sound of the wheels screeching on the tarmac is a welcome relief. Good thing I always carry a parachute just in case though, eh.”
Mr Sheen has already gone through twelve instructors at the Torres Flight School in nearby New Jersey, as only a few are brave enough to fly with the actor."

It has been a terrible time for us, we were so looking forward to going down to Pontins for our Christmas party,” sub editor, Mike Hunt, said whilst weeping into a soiled handkerchief.
Pontins, which as a British tradition, is famous for its cockroaches, vomit stained bed sheets, fecal matter smeared walls and nasty attitude from the staff.
“That was the charm of the place. You go there, get totally blootered, then relax in your flea infested mouldy room. You can only go to that place when drunk out of your f * cking mind, if you’re ever sober, that’s when it gets really bad. Imagine waking up sober in someone else’s vomit with cockroaches all over your face? You’d be distraught if you weren’t drunk,” Alan Titmunch, one of the Squib’s features writers said.
“Pontins is the only place where you have to wipe your feet on the way out of their chalets,” another Squib writer quipped."
Posh Spice Swallows Pea in Dinner Drama,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1716-posh-spice-swallows-pea-in-dinner-drama.html,2009,"Victoria Beckham were said to be dining at a well-known Los Angeles eaterie when staff and diners underwent a terrifying twenty minutes of total pandemonium.
“We knew she was coming because she had alerted the paparazzi to be at the door when she arrived with the boys. Mrs Beckham who ordered us to have her liquid diet ready, then made a terrible mistake. She ate one of Brooklyn’s peas which was a side dish with his sausage and chips. It was one pea too many. She does not eat solids and her face first went red, then purple and then blue. She was wacking around the restaurant in her couture clothes retching, gasping and projectile vomiting rancid green liquid. Frankly it was an awful spectacle and many diners were traumatised from the whole experience,” Emil Schaffhausen, the restaurant’s manager told MTV.
Diners were also left gagging for sick bags after witnessing the ex-Spice girl puking like a trooper.
“Anyone who knows Victoria Beckham, knows that she never eats solids. We’re still trying to find out what happened. Maybe it was a suicide attempt because she hasn’t eaten solid food for twenty years now and she must have known what would happen after eating the pea,” a close friend of the ‘talented’ pop star told MTV news.
There are even rumours being circulated around LA’s showbiz circuit that Mrs Beckham is ready to sue the restaurant.
“Who told her to eat the pea? No one forced her. Hell, let her sue the restaurant. I never seen the bitch smile anyway. She comes here with her  lil  boys, like twice a week. We prepare her soup for her then she leaves without saying a word or ever smiling once. I reckon she ain’t human. Maybe the pea got inside her circuitry or something. Who knows?” Mr Schaffhausen said defiantly from his restaurant.
Her husband, David Beckham, is currently in Milan enjoying the attention of the Italian ladies. He was spotted at a charity ball with about twenty hot Italian ladies vying for his attention whilst Mrs Beckham was back in America."
Amy Winehouse Punches Fan After He Offers Her Singing Lessons,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1395-amy-winehouse-punches-fan-after-he-offers-her-singing-lessons.html,2008,"A voice coach and singing instructor to the stars was beaten violently in front of the cameras by Amy Winehouse over the weekend.
Amy Winehouse was in the middle of her set and slurring her words so badly that she couldn’t even be saved by her beloved Antares Autotuner. Some audience members likened her ‘singing’ to the sound of a “mortally wounded cat in heat” and others commented on her “Thorazine shuffle” as she limped around the stage.
“Sometimes her eyes would roll back in their sockets just exposing the whites, or one eye would roll up whilst the other eye stared ahead vacantly. She brought up some phlegmy froth during the second song and spat it into an engineer’s beer glass and then started laughing like a maniac when he drank from it. Her third song saw her shuffling around the stage and mumbling incoherently whilst waving her bony rear at revellers. We don’t know what the brown substance trickling down her leg was, but it seems the hospital did not supply poor Amy with enough nappies for the night,” music journalist for Melody Maker magazine, Arthur Bevel-Cardigan Johnsons reported.
It was only when the ailing celebrity got down off the main stage and decided to sing her hit song “Rehab” to the audience that things got dangerous.
Glastonbury concert goer Andrew Loog Masterson is an accomplished vocal coach and has coached many stars of the stage and pop world. He was at the front of the stage when Amy trudged towards him mewling like an inhuman animal with its leg caught in a trap.
“Before any Amy Winehouse fans send me any nasty letters, I would just like to say that I did not provoke her in any way. I simply asked her if she would like some singing lessons. That’s when she elbowed me and whacked my eye with her fist. She then told me that she is the best “fakkin'” singer in the “fakkin'” world and then continued moaning incoherently.”
Mr Masterson then went on to add: “At the end of the day it is all part of being at the front and being pushed by thousands of people. It is all part of the Glastonbury experience. I’m just pleased I got to see her before she finally croaks. Not everyone can say they have been hit by Amy Winehouse.”
The fracas was put to an abrupt end by security guards ordered into the violent scene by Glastonbury owner Michael Eavis who had nothing but praise for the celebrity Winehouse.
“If it wasn’t for everyone coming to see the trainwreck that is Amy Winehouse before she finally pops her clogs then I would’ve been out of a few quid. As it is, no one came here to see the headliner R’n’b artist Jay-Z and his sampler on stage – they came to see the trainwreck celebrity. Thank you Amy for being such an entertaining drug- addled loser,” Mr Eavis said.
Mr Eavis would like to book Amy Winehouse for next year’s Glastonbury, but the probability of her still being around then is extremely slim."
Celebrity Rehab,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1095-celebrity-rehab.html,2007,"Dr. Frankenheimer of the Celebrity Institute of Rehabilitation Labs Inc. in Malibu California has operated on many patients in his time as an esteemed member of the Institute.
‘Terminal attention seeking Disorder’, ‘Paparazzi hungry media whore Syndrome’ and ‘Hey look at me I’m famous for sucking the right peep syndrome’ are all D-list celebrity success ploys he has thus treated.
Amongst the many clients he has counselled – the glamour star ‘lazy left eye’ Paris Hilton who has got her lizard-like claws into most facets of worldwide media, a former boy band member or two and other minor ‘celebrities’.
Dr. Frankenheimer’s many techniques for treatment include debasement and ego tenderizing examinations. These groundbreaking medical sessions involve bringing the deluded ‘celebrities’ back down to earth from their false-fame aspirations to reveal their true selves.
A routine treatment involves the minor ‘celebrity’ be strapped to a chair and forced to listen to their own music or watch video footage of themselves for 48 hours straight at high decibel levels. The D-List ‘stars’ will then be further naturalized by having members of the medical team urinate on them from approximately 10 feet above their cell mattress.
These are an integral process for the institute and have proved so successful that the programs are now being integrated within the world of American Politics where there are many who are masquerading as something they are not – ‘Statesman’.
Dr Frankenheimer’s thesis is one taken straight from the text book of a future Nobel Laureate.
After five days of having former ‘pop star’ Robbie Williams anally raped by three convicts on parole, Dr Frankenheimer had to up the scale because he found that some patients actually enjoyed being “butt mashed” by convicts.
The next level was to have Williams placed in a courtyard with some young ladies in short skirts and this was a truly repulsive task for Williams resulting in a weight loss program from running.
Admission
Naturally, waiting lists for treatment are currently three years behind for the ground breaking cure. Costs are in the region of $6,000 per day for an 8 by 4 cell and the brochure states that one must be a minor ‘D-Listed Celebrity’ to join.
As most people who are in the media light at the moment fall under this bracket there is a huge demand. The many Rehab clinics for ‘Celebrities’ that have sprung up all over California have attempted to capitalise on Dr Frankenheimer’s success but none have the same pulling power.
“I needed help and the doc got it for me.” Exclaims Mr Williams as he fondles his pet Chihuahua in the holding cell. “There was no hope left, I actually thought I was a talented musician and star.”
It seems he now knows what he really is – A moribund working-mans-club ex boyband twink.
“To get to the top I had to please a lot of managers and executives, my knee pads were wearing out and I must’ve gulped big wads of ‘success juice’.”
A recovering ‘D-Lister’ Williams now holds court in his cell and when it is lunch time eats his mush with pride. Williams looks up at me from his recently soiled mattress and says poignantly.
“I am now ready to go back out and take my true place – as a dustman for Greater Manchester Council.”
All Hell Breaks Loose
Jay Kay from the ailing pop act ‘Jamiroquai’ checks into the lab as I interview the talented doctor and immediately a cordon of nurses and security men descend upon the little ‘pop star’.
There is a commotion as the deluded star assumes they are paparazzi and his fans when in fact they are not holding cameras but restraining equipment including a large straight jacket.
I nod at the doctor and show my approval, it has been a long time coming.
Looking upon the plaque on the wall in the admissions centre, it is plain to see that the clientele list is a veritable ‘who’s who’ of ‘stars’ from the 90’s onward.
It is not surprising to see such luminaries as Simon Cowell, Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie, these are par for the course as well as distinguished alumni like Fred Durst and Black Eyed Peas.
The list is immense and a commemoration rivaling the rosta of a cheap ego stroking benefits concert for poor people in Africa.
It is safe to say that the institute has an endless supply of talentless hacks to deck their illustrious blood and vomit soaked walls."
Pete Doherty Not Arrested,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1087-pete-doherty-not-arrested.html,2007,"Pete Doherty has not been arrested for three consecutive days.
The Babyshambles singer who was being arrested everyday for the last 2 years for drug offences involving Class A drugs seems to have taken a break from being arrested.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told The Squib: “At 16.05, officers on foot stopped and spoke with a 27 year old man in the street in Whitechapel, E1. 
The officers were concerned that he was showing no signs of being under the influence of drugs and subsequently stood back in amazement.”
He added: “The last three days have been mayhem for the officers concerned and they have now taken medical leave.”
Doherty, infamous for sticking syringe needles full of heroin sometimes four at a time into his arms and smoking crack rocks with his breakfast cereal was not available for comment.
Babyshambles are due to continue their UK tour tonight at Sudbury Recreation Hall and will actually turn up for the concert."

Pete Doherty’s Crack
“I’ve seen Peaches and Pixie smoking crack like it was going out of fashion. Sting’s daughter, Coco, who now hangs out with Pete Doherty, smokes so much crack that she’s lost her voice temporarily. They say it’s the new fashion and they want to get emphysema too just like Amy,” DJ Jack Curran who regularly spins for the stars in Camden’s Monarch pub told Melody Maker magazine.
For the last few years anorexia was the big thing, especially in the fashion world where size zero was all the rage. Now emphysema and walking around with an oxygen tank is the current craze of choice with the party set of Camden and Primrose Hill. Kate Moss and Sadie Frost have already had oxygen tanks delivered to their homes, and Kate Moss is often seen sporting hers whilst driving her daughter to school.
‘Sema like Amy
Last week one of Bob Geldof’s daughters was seen at Claridge’s with an oxygen tank and mask firmly in tow. She was spied downing large vodkas and even attempting to smoke while the oxygen mask was still over her face. The photo event was celebrated in all media sources with full page spreads thus encrusting her jaunt into celebrity history.
Emphysema is an irreversible degenerative condition, so once you get it you’ve got it for life. Smoke from crack cocaine is particularly harsh on the lungs and will deteriorate the body faster than other products like tobacco.
“Crack is the drug of choice for these celebrities because it will speed up the onset of the degenerative lung disease faster than smoking normal cigarettes,” Angie Dickinson, a reporter for the BBC 5 music programme ‘Munters’ featuring pop celebrity Lilly Allen, said."
Has BeyoncÃ© Gone Too Far?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1451-has-beyonc%c3%a3%c2%a9-gone-too-far.html,2008,"Tabloid  trashmag  website TMZ first sparked the debate when it said the images were a “slap to whites”.
“L’Oreo forced Beyonce to endure hours of sulphuric acid treatment at a secret location in Paris. This revolutionary treatment involves dipping the whole body in a large vat of acid so that the first layer of black skin comes off,” a TMZ reporter was quoted as saying. “L’Oreo cookie”
Meanwhile, the New York Post accused L’Oreo of making the singer appear like a “white person.”
“She’s black on the inside and now white on the outside. It’s like a reverse Oreo cookie,” a reporter for the paper bleated.
The Crazy in Love Antares Autotune star has even had her eyeballs replaced with blue eyes as showcased in the September Elle magazine ad for skin lightening products.
Beyoncé, 27, has a £2.3 million, five-year contract with the beauty giant for which she only has to work 10 days a year.
L’Oreo said it informed Beyoncé of certain conditions before she signed the contract in December.
“We highly value our relationship with Ms Knowles. This treatment for Beyonce is testament to L’Oreo’s outstanding excellence in changing appearances.”
A spokesman for the singer refused to comment."
Spice Girls Really Wanna Zimmer Zimmer ah!,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1051-spice-girls-really-wanna-zimmer-zimmer-ah.html,2007,"Fresh from the bingo hall the Spice Girls now come resplendent with a full set of bingo wings to match.
They will soon embark on a world tour because they need money, well, Posh Spice who is the bones behind Beckham does not but the rest do.
“I need a new washer and dryer,” Sporty Spice says as she bemoans her last washer chewing up her tracksuit bottoms and other chav gear.
“I need a new Stenna stairlift for my mansion,” says Ginger Geri-atric Spice.
“I need a new personality because I never had one anyway,” squeaks Baby Spice Bunton with a vacant look. A tall order if we ever heard and one that money can never rectify.
“I need a new man,” says Scary Spice as she looks through a paternity dossier from her lawyers.
“I don’t need anyfing because my David gives me anyfing I want innit,” says Posh Spice pouting like a simian sour lemon.
The Spice Girls will all rake in 10 million pounds each for the worldwide tour.
This is not a bad proposition seeing as they do not have to sing one note throughout the 20 date tour.
The Spice Girls who have no talent or musical ability whatsoever have been busy in the studio putting down tracks so that they can mime to all the songs on stage.
“We have them sing in the studio, well, they can’t sing per se, they just grunt and besides it is so off key anyway,” one of the engineers says “…but after we digitally assist their atrocious voices we have them sounding like angels, and hey presto!”
The Antares technology used can alter anyones voice to sing in correct pitch in real time and in the studio.
The Zimmer frame Girls are currently having a refresher course about the art of miming from their first days of fame with a professional mime coach, Ashlee Simpson, who has been recruited for the extensive tour.
“It’s been many years since we been on stage miming so we got all our ‘zimmer zimmer ah’ dance moves together too innit!” says Posh Spice from her Aston Martin Vantage.
The group said the shows would be in Los Angeles on Dec. 12; Las 
Vegas on Dec. 13; New York on Dec. 14; London on Dec. 18; Cologne, 
Germany, on Dec. 23; Madrid, Spain, on Dec. 24; Beijing on Jan. 12;

Artists Hold Benefit Concert for Themselves,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1047-artists-hold-benefit-concert-for-themselves.html,2007,"“I’m sick of all the hypocrisy, we have always been in it for ourselves, and we all know it,” says an ashamed pop star who wants to remain anonymous for now.
The truth is, benefits concerts like “Live8 – Make Poverty History” and “Live Earth” are simply vehicles for record companies and artists to sell more records and stroke their already huge egos even further.
“No one in their right mind would even think that a stupid pledge like ‘Make Poverty History’ will actually do anything to anyone apart from the self-serving artist on stage,” says one of the architects of the artists worldwide concerts “These are all tools we use to revive dead artists as well as increase sales for live artists too.”
“After Live8 we gained new fans and our record sales increased by 75%, now that is fucking incredible, we sure made poverty history there because we were desperate since our 80s stardom, I was close to bankruptcy and the royalties had all gone up my nose in the 90s,” exclaimed a bleary-eyed Simon Le Ponce.
“The ‘Benefit The Corporate Artists’ concert is going to benefit me because I would like some more money,” Joss Stone says from her Malibu mansion.
This time, the new pledge will not be some false and preposterous impossibility engineered by marketeers to increase sales off the misery of the less fortunate but will be a blatant pledge to give to the egos and bank balances of all the people involved.
These corporate artists who will gather together for the worldwide concerts are for the first time in their sordid careers being true to themselves, some have had to have extensive psychiatric help to deal with this issue.
“Not one penny or cent is going to charity this time, before we gave 14% to charity with pledge concerts but now 100% goes to the artists involved.” says one of the accountants in the team jubilantly.
No doubt this concert will pull in the crowds, the many corporate artists who have signed up are all in line to make a financial killing.
The concerts will be held in New York, São Paulo, Paris, Shanghai, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Sydney, Tokyo, Madrid and Stockholm.
Preparations are underway for the worldwide concerts and after yesterday’s grand finale at ‘Live Earth’ where Al Gore actually lifted off the stage and was propelled by hot air into the atmosphere, organisers for the ‘Benefit The Corporate Artists’ concert are brainstorming on what they can do to top that.
Watch this space for forthcoming dates and final line-up for the “Benefit The Corporate Artists” worldwide extravaganza.
Sponsors “Benefit The Corporate Artists” concert have already arranged for a massive fireworks extravaganza and light show that would rival any new years party.
The pledge that will be touted this time is a blatant “You Give – We Take”
Spread the word people, at least they are being honest this time."
George Michael Builds Public Toilet in North London Home,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1491-george-michael-builds-public-toilet-in-north-london-home.html,2008,"Walking into George Michael’s secluded Highgate mansion in North London you are immediately assaulted with the distinct smell of urine and the sound of flushing urinals.
The toilet obsessed music star is such a fan of lavatories that he has built his own replica public toilet in his house.
“I love the smell of urine in the morning. Armitage Shanks is my hero. Look at this toilet bowl it’s so clean you can almost eat your dinner off it..and I often do I tell you,” he exclaims pointing at one of the urinals in the kitchen.
Every room in the 24 bedroom mansion is decked out with similar toilet furnishings including a large authentic looking toilet cubicle in the drawing room resplendent with graffiti on the walls and a freshly laid turd languishing on the toilet seat. There are also extensive facilities available for all the daily visitors to indulge in crack smoking and the strongest skunk weed is available day and night. The police do not bother George because of his famous celebrity status and this is proven because whenever they catch him in public smoking crack they let him off with a mild caution.
George doesn’t have to venture out into the dank public gentlemen’s toilets in London or LA anymore because he’s got everything he wants at home.
“I used to enjoy blowing white van men I just met in the Hampstead Heath bogs but sadly the thrill is gone. Too many coppers about trying to stop the Greek lover doin’ his thang. All I want and enjoy is now at home, so gay builders now visit my toilets for a session without fear of prosecution. On a good day you can see the queue for my toilets going out past my car-park and sometimes even onto the main street.”
George Michael’s toilets are so popular that he has even employed his long-term boyfriend Kenny Goss as the official toilet cleaner to mop up the daily ejaculate mess from the hundreds of males who visit the £7.5 million mansion in North London.
Haringey council approved planning permission for the toilets in George Michael’s house within a week of applying on grounds that he was providing a public service to many men in the borough and the Greater London area."
Paris’ Early Jail Release,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1076-paris-early-jail-release.html,2007,"In another land mark case rivaling the OJ Simpson verdict, the American ‘Justice’ System was again today revealed to be a lawless money trench where rich celebrities dictate what they do and how much impunity they have.
Paris, 26, who is the pornographic film heir to the Hilton hotel fortune was released early due to large sums of money changing hands within the American legal system sham worldwide laughing stock.
She was greeted at the prison gates by her friends Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson and whisked away to her 4000 sq ft luxury penthouse where she will spend the next 45 days in complete luxury and ‘house-arrest’, waited on by an army of butlers and servants.
The early release was engineered by long standing friend of the Hilton family, Sheriff Lee Oswald, who will no doubt be properly recompensed for his good deed at the exclusive Beverly Hills Golf Club later on in the evening.
The  Sheriff  cited that Paris was released early because a person of her stature could not survive without her: private masseuse, publicists, manicurists, make-up artists, nutritionists, wardrobe consultants, spiritual advisors, accountants, stockbrokers, blackberry engineer, car mechanics, personal assistants, cocaine dealers, astrologers, tanning salon staff, hairdressers and her beloved poodle  Tinkerbell.
This goes to prove the old adage ‘Crime Pays’ but only if you are a celebrity and have loads of dosh..innit?"

“Kate has the right look for the longstanding gritty drama, we were looking for someone like her. She smokes about 80 fags a day, snorts loads of coke and has a face with the texture of a leather sofa from DFS. It was like an instant connection, she gets on with the rest of the cast like a house on fire,” Reggie Warrington, one of the senior casting directors told the TV Times.
The new addition to the cast will see the introduction of much needed glamour onto the set.
“We’ve never had anyone as glamorous and beautiful as Kate on an Eastenders set ever. Her introduction certainly will increase the prestige of our program,” a senior cast member divulged.
Rumour has it that Kate may have an important role to play in the Queen Vic pub, but you will have to wait and see for yourselves.

Unknown 'Celebrity' Wins Another Reality Show,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1583-unknown-celebrity-wins-another-reality-show.html,2008,"It was another win for an unknown celebrity who no one knows about on another brainless reality show designed to showcase unknown celebrities.
The huge audience was urged to phone in and vote for the celebrity and at  £ 4.50  per second the show’s producers brought in huge revenue for their already bloated salaries.
“Yes, we had another unknown celebrity win from another bunch of has-been unknown celebrities who are trying to kick-start their comatose celebrity careers. This unknown celebrity can now eek out another 30 seconds of their two minutes of fame and will probably fizzle out after a few advertising companies use their unknown faces for a few commercials,” Larry Silverstein of Mike Hunt Entertainment told ITV1 news.
There are now so many celebrities inundating the media that it is at times hard to even know who any of them are.  With large quantity comes loss of quality, and with the celebrities we have massing around reality shows and garish vulgar dance competitions, one would only think that they resemble bluebottle flies massing round a large steaming turd ripe from the ar * e of a brainless, unimaginative, greed-driven TV executive.
Mr Silverstein had this to say about the gawking viewership: “This is what the dumbed-down British audiences want . They are given utter moronic crap to digest into their maggot addled skull cavities as they are graced with brainless celebrity nonsense and they lap it all up without question. This is the reality. We have brainwashed audiences clamoring for more Big Brother, Jungle, Strictly Come, X factor, vapid low-grade diarrhoea that wreaks of banal fetid vulgarity and the Labour-sanctioned mantra of “Education, education, education”.
Indeed, living in Labour’s Britain is very bad for the soul, what with the daily threat of being stabbed through the eyeball with a six inch knife whilst walking down the street by a crazed teenage thug or being made destitute from the enormous taxes heaped on everything; or how about freezing in your negative equitied mortgage hell unheated hovel with a mouldy piece of bread for dinner and a bucket of gruel to keep you company.
Well, don’t fret, at least there are the celebrity reality shows on every channel to cheer you the f * ck up."
Merry Christmas From the Daily Squib Lapland Theme Park,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1607-merry-christmas-from-the-daily-squib-lapland-theme-park.html,2008,"You will be enchanted this Christmas with a visit to see the wonderful Northern Lights (some flashing lights strapped to a tree) or perhaps enjoy the company of Santa’s elves (young offenders from the local job centre wacked out on pills and cheap Aldi wine).
Visitors are encouraged to close their eyes as much as possible whilst at the Lapland theme park; it also helps if you are totally blind.
The entrance to Santa’s grotto is always caked in fresh vomit and half eaten doner kebabs and is found after a fifteen minute walk through a muddy field.
Why not get into a vicious fistfight with one of the burly security men who demand you pay an extra ten pounds to enter a tent claiming to be a bustling Christmas market but in fact houses a dodgy old man selling bricks for twenty quid each from a suitcase.
Every young visitor has the opportunity to see Santa and receive a little present from him — usually a pack of ten Benson or a mini vodka bottle.
Our authentic Alaskan Huskies (Rottweilers) are a dream and can be seen roaming their tiny kennels looking for an opportunity to rip someones f * cking arm off.
The Nativity scene is of course our best feature and you will be enchanted by a piece of painted plywood at the end of another large muddy field.
The entrance fee is only £65 per person. We guarantee that everyone in your family will have an excellent time at our Lapland theme park or your money back (you will never see your money ever again)."

“I think he was trying to show us that he’s worth our time for the upcoming election. We half expected him to sing with a low manly voice but instead he came out with a high-pitched squeak. It was quite alarming actually and some members for the meeting hurriedly walked out because they found it so funny. After Balls did a rendition of ‘Jerusalem’ in his castrato voice, there were people doubling up on the floor with laughter,” Councillor George Edwin, told the Mirror newspaper.
Mr Balls turned up at the meeting to the astonishment of the assembled council members without an announcement. He was shadowed by a BBC film crew and some local reporters who watched the performance in its entirety before retreating from the meeting in hysterics.
The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families is set to attend other Labour controlled councils across the South East to try and rally the troops for the coming general election."

When he’s not jetting around the world spewing nonsense about global warming, Al Gore hangs out in his home dungeon listening to sordid heavy metal music and skinning live bats, his wife has claimed.
According to papers filed at the supreme court, Al Gore, repeatedly listened to ‘hellish’ bands like WASP, Slayer and Barry Manilow in his room. He played loud guitars at all times of the night and day was said to be possessed by “demonic spirits”.
Tipper Gore is a prominent member of the PMRC, whose sole claim to fame in the 80s was to place fear into the ignorant, generally stupid American parents blaming controversial music figures for disruption, aggression and violence.
“She would come home from PMRC rallies and find Al in a corner chewing on a bone wearing outrageous spandex trousers listening to Twisted Sister at very loud volume. This was just last week as well. How would she be able to face the PMRC board after seeing that? Mr Gore would also repeatedly cause offence by singing lyrics from some of these awful bands and stick his tongue out whilst banging his head. At breakfast time, this was unacceptable behaviour and was a major cause for the marriage breakdown,” Jacob Horovitz, one of Tipper’s attorneys told CBS news."
Lady KaKa Honoured for Revolutionising Music Industry,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2211-lady-kaka-honoured-for-revolutionising-music-industry.html,2010,"The music biz was stagnating for a while after the advent of digital audio where anyone could download music for free without paying for it — that is until Lady KaKa came onto the scene.
“People actually want to pay for KaKa’s music! Forget about downloading it for free, they want to buy this toilet’s music. Hell, they want to even buy the fuckin’ album. I nearly shit my pants when I saw that. We got her singing template songs through an Antares, with some vocoder or something, I dunno, we got her in a room with some engineers. She can’t actually sing or write music, she can’t play an instrument, she just dresses up with a toilet seat around her head or some such crap so all the little girls and gays love her. Who fuckin’ cares, I drive a Lamborghini Countach Quattrovalvole and own three mansions in Malibu because of this turd,” Milton Earl III Esq. of Backsplash Records told MTV.
Indeed, the Music Industry has never had it so good. There is finally some cash flowing into its empty coffers.
“The biz is now for people like KaKa, so we don’t have to have anyone who can play, sing or compose music. You may think nothing has changed much but believe me when I say, we used to have a time once when real bands played actual music,” Mr Earl added.
It seems that this new character called Lady KaKa has created a new genre for herself; it certainly is not Dada or Surrealism but a dingleberry on the ass of the mindless generation of brainwashed consumer  sheeple  to devour without any thought or reason.
“The people now consume excrement without even batting an eyelid. This is why Lady KaKa is so popular and this is why my bank account is simply overflowing with cash,” Mr Earl shouts from his Lamborghini before shooting off into the California sunset.
Lady KaKa is to be 
honoured for services rendered to the Music Industry at the 136th Music Biz Awards in Los Angeles on April 23."

Mel’s publicist, Smaka Mabitchup, did not confirm or deny the rumour that the couple were an item when asked by the X17 papparazzi agency.
Gossip columnists in Hollywood were speculating about the importance of such a union: “Mel already has about 15 kids, then add on Nadya Octomom’s kids and that makes about 43 between them both. I guess that was the main attraction between these two, oh, and don’t forget Mel’s millions. We all know that Octomom needs the money real bad,” Laurie Koot, editor for Hollywood Today wrote.
Octomom is so desperate for any money that she said she will put up with the violence meted out daily from serial pugilist, Gibson.

“It’s like, going to be a great fuckin’ movie. The plot revolves around a foul mouthed racist abusive drunk who likes to punch women in the f * cking teeth. But, check this out. He saves the day, because even though he’s a sh * tbag with the personality of a moronic Christian evangelist god botherer, whilst on  a day trip to a  wildlife park in the Bronx,  he saves a girl from a ‘pack of ni**ers’ who threaten to rape her. Then there are the jews in the movie, not only do they thieve all the money from everyone in the cast, they also start all the frickin’ wars and the strife throughout the whole film. But of course, Mel’s character comes along, he wears sandals and starts preaching the gospel of Gibson to save the day. This movie is going to break the box office, I tell you. This script has been on Mel’s mind for a very long time and finally it’s coming into fruition,” Mel’s agent, Jakob Lieberhymie, told Talent Weekly.
Mel Gibson chose to set the location of the film in his own house, sources close to the production have revealed.
“He’s been filming this movie in his own house and using people around him. At first I thought it was a bit strange but then I got used to it, much like the black eyes, the broken teeth and abuse from his drunken ass mouth,” Gibson’s estranged Russian girlfriend told CNN’s Larry King yesterday.

“This new show has become a huge ratings hit with not only the British public but worldwide as well. It’s set in Libya and involves minor British celebrities being dropped in an area of Libya with little food, no compass and no weapons. If they can survive for three days while all hell is breaking loose around them, then they win the prize; which is an all-expenses-paid trip to Tunisia,” the shows creator, Al Hertyu, for Endemol productions, disclosed.
The first episode last night, got off to an excellent start when scumbag ex-politician, Lembik Opik was shot in the rear with an AK47 and the whole cast of Eastenders were whisked away by merceneries to an undisclosed jail where they will never be seen again.
ITV executives were rubbing their hands with delight as the ratings reached 42 million for the first episode alone.
“D-List celebrities are lining up to be included in the show. It’s the ultimate career boost for these people. They’ll do anything to be famous,” Mr Hertyu added.
So far, all 34 celebrities on the first show are unaccounted for and are presumed dead.
The next show will include Katie Price and Peter Andre as well as Alex Reid.

Genuine Guitarists Relieved After Guitar Hero Game Demise,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2647-genuine-guitarists-relieved-after-guitar-hero-game-demise.html,2011,"What used to take hours of noodling around on the guitar in the bedroom was bastardized and soiled by Guitar Hero, many real guitarists claim.
“It would take many years to really learn the guitar. You have to know all the intricate scales, the massive chord vocabulary and also get the feel right, you know, your own style. Hours and hours of intricate practice daily and an unwavering dedication to carry on whilst other lesser kids were out there playing silly games. Then Guitar Hero the game came out, and suddenly playing guitar was trivialised to a level below drumming,” Yngwie Vai, 24, a seasoned bedroom guitarist told Guitar Weekly magazine.
Another real guitarist, Joseph von Satriani, from San Francisco, said: “The Guitar Hero game had no relation to the real guitar and was only a vehicle for idiots to think they could play the guitar. You try and play an Emaj9 and then a complicated Django Reinhardt jazz scale on one of those plastic guitars with about five buttons on them. It made a mockery of real guitarists.”
“I can understand the game DJ Hero being on the Xbox because to be a DJ there’s no skill or musicality involved apart from mixing one song that someone else wrote into another song that someone else wrote. Now that game was made for the games consoles, but guitars are for real musicians not assholes who can’t play a note on any instrument,” another musician revealed."

Billy Batts, works at a Brooklyn video games emporium and said: “They came in here last week like fruit flies buying the console like they were hot cakes or something. I saw one moron buy five of them for the whole family, he even gave one to his six month baby. Now those same people are coming in here two days later with their eyes all whacked. They keep bumping into everything in the store. Like, I’m the one who has to pick everything up?”
“Even  though I can’t walk the streets in a straight f * cking line anymore or  read a book, I can play my 3DS console so I’m happy. It’s a small price  to pay for 3D games,” Ronnie Michaels, 22, a resident of Long Island  told CBS news.
Worldwide  Nintendo 3DS users all seem to be enjoying the games console and are  thrilled with the games as well as the permanent irreversible  side-effects.

The spectacular release will be filmed for a Channel 4  retrospective  program about the artist’s work.
“It’s the final journey for the shark. I will miss it as it swims gently into the horizon and sinks under the water forever. My studio has fitted a mechanical device into the shark which will make this seemingly impossible feat possible,” Mr Hirst said.
Bathers on the Blackpool seafront have already been warned by the coast guard that the shark will be swimming in the area and they should not be alarmed if they see it.
According to art world pundits, Charles Saatchi, who commissioned the piece in the first place, will be the one on the sea shore who will press the all important release button.
“When we release the shark, I will have a huge tear well up in my eyeball. It will run down my cheek and land on the rocks below me. I will be sad, yet relieved for the shark. It will go to a place where it will be away from the prying eyes of the crowds. It will finally be able to go home,” Mr Saatchi said.
There are also plans to release the Hirst cow that was sawn in half into a deserted field next year."

Sarkozy to Join Travelling Circus,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2204-sarkozy-to-join-travelling-circus.html,2010,"“Nicolas has had enough. He is now travelling through France and Brussels with the travelling Extraordinaire Cirque, who have him as one of their main attractions,” Jean Renoir, a political commentator for Le Monde said on Monday.
Mr Sarkozy has said that he is happy to be part of the circus and will be performing with the clowns as a midget act.
“When Nicolas comes out onto the circus stage there are wild cheers for him. It’s not like when he was a politician where people spat and booed at him. He is positively adored for his act with the clowns as a midget,” Monsieur LeBlanc, the circus’ ringmaster said.
Nicolas Sarkozy’s IMP party suffered a heavy reverse at the polls yesterday evening when Socialist opposition and its Green allies won an estimated 55 per cent 
of 
the vote leaving Sarkozy nursing a heavy wound after the trouncing.
Speaking from his circus caravan in  Beziers , Mr Sarkozy said that he was “happier now than ever before in my life” and that he wished “everyone could experience the utter freedom of travelling the open road in the midget troupe”."
The Strokes Have Pacemakers Fitted After Stroke Scare,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2662-the-strokes-have-pacemakers-fitted-after-stroke-scare.html,2011,"“The Strokes are trying to get back after many years in the wilderness. They had been enjoying their royalties until all of a sudden it all dried up, so they’re back again to remind their fans that they still exist and to carry on buying their stuff so that they can carry on with their lifestyles,” Mr Banque revealed during an interview for NME.
The Strokes underwent crucial heart treatment after all four members suffered minor strokes when they were playing during a practice session in Manhattan.

“One minute they were playing and the next they were holding their heads and looking all lop sided. They went down like dominos, one after the other. At first I thought they got electrocuted. It’s safe to say that I then realised that The Strokes had all had strokes. It was something that really astounded me and strangely turned me on,” lead singer Julian’s girlfriend, Audrey Mumps, revealed.
As soon as The Strokes had their strokes, they were all rushed to New York’s premier hospital where they were treated immediately for their strokes.
“Don’t worry folks, The Strokes are going to carry on touring despite their strokes. Hey, they have to pay for their hospital bills somehow eh. No sign of that Obamacare any time soon huh. It’s enough to give you a stroke, innit,” their manager quipped."
Heather Mills to Star in ‘Dancing on Thin Ice’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2096-heather-mills-to-star-in-dancing-on-thin-ice.html,2010,"“Heather will go out into the middle of a frozen lake and attempt to dance on the thinnest ice there is. The goal of the show is to see her fall into the freezing water and get a good dunking. After awhile, someone might go and try to rescue her but we’ll have to see about that,” Anders Johannsen, series producer for the Endemol production told Media Weekly.
Ever since winning the lottery, the ex-wife of Paul McCartney has been living in a specially built bunker 450 metres under the earth’s surface.
Heather is so hated by the public and media that the only place she can live in is an underground bunker somewhere up North. Some people think the facility is in Scotland but there has been no definite news on its whereabouts. Thankfully the public airways have not been polluted with her wild-eyed psychotic rants for some time now since her isolation — that is until now.
“No one’s seen her for awhile so people will want to watch the show just to see this scraggy witch get a good dunking. We’re sure that the McCartney clan will definitely be watching as well to see peggy thrashing around in sub zero waters. This show is going to be bigger than Celebrity Big Brother we can guarantee. We even thought about introducing a few hungry polar bears into the mix to increase the ‘wow’ factor, we’re still in negotiations with London Zoo,” Mr Johannsen added rubbing his hands together in anticipation.
‘Dancing on Thin Ice’ starring Heather Mills  starts tomorrow on ITV4 at 6.43pm"

One of the contestants, Miss Sarah Palin was attacked as she got on stage to show off her swimsuit.
“Miss Palin was onstage and was showing off her talent when there was a commotion in the audience. A geriatric man of about 139 had got past security somehow and with one of his hands cupped one of Miss Palin’s breasts whilst making lewd remarks and actions. The man was quickly arrested and is now under custody. The traumatised contestant is currently being give councilling after her attacker left his false teeth and a large amount of slobber in her cleavage during the commotion as he was arrested,” organiser, Joanna Wachika told Alaska Daily News.
The man was later identified as Jonathan McCain from an Arizona Nursing Home. He had escaped last week and had been on the run with no sightings.
Because of the breach of security this year, the organisers have vowed to increase all security for the 2009 contest."
New Charlie Sheen Sitcom 'One and Three Quarters Man' Airs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2669-new-charlie-sheen-sitcom-one-and-three-quarters-man-airs.html,2011,"“This one’s going to be it. The big kahuna, the toasted tuna, the..er..chatanooga,” Sheen said at a recent news conference in his jacuzzi at his Beverly Hills mansion.
The star was interviewed for CBS’ The Early Show on Wednesday and described the format for the new show.
“The character I play is on one drug only — me. Okay, I lied, he does coke, crack, meth and shitloads of booze, but that’s neither here nor there. Is that a blue balloon popping over at the tipatoe mansion? Blake’s got redness. I said get ’em out honey, yeah both of them,” Charlie then gestures at one of the assembled actresses, who goes under the water to perform fellatio upon his shrivelled member.
The CBS crew are allowed to walk around the Beverly Hills mansion to see for themselves how Sheen has recovered after his much publicised meltdown a week ago.
“Over here is the garden. Dambusters on the vine, squeak, and a lot of shebas. And over in that corner, is my pet olive, I try and feed her every morning but she stays on the tree, kinda looking sad. Do you ever remember when you were a kid, how you used to smell things and how it triggers those memories as an adult now? The guest house is at the end of the yard and we like to cook bagels there in the evenings. Did I tell you earthworms about the time when I dropped three to four seven-gram rocks and had to move past the quarter line with an apple digger? Yeah, it was awesome. Time to memorize! I’m bitchin’ and I got all the info about everything and everyone in the world, all at the same time, or was that last Tuesday. I’m winning, we’re winning and losing at the same time on many different levels of 911, September, when the planes crashed into the WTC. I was cooking hard boiled eggs, big ones, small ones and square ones,” Charlie Sheen tells the reporters at the top of his voice, before passing out on the lawn face down, twitching uncontrollably.
The first series of ‘One and Three Quarters Man’ will air next Wednesday night on the DBO Public Access Network."
Amy Winehouse to Star in Female Version of Scarface Movie,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1497-amy-winehouse-to-star-in-female-version-of-scarface-movie.html,2008,"The new Scarface movie is an adaptation of an Oliver Stone script which he penned whilst wacked out on cocaine back in 1981.   “Say hello to my little friend” “I wrote this script during my bad years. I needed the money and was asked to do a job about the drug trade and gangsters. I myself was doing huge amounts of cocaine during that period as was everyone else in the industry. Brian [De-Palma] approached me last year and asked if I could incorporate that script with the British pop star Amy Winehouse. I didn’t know who she was at first but after checking out her picture on google I immediately agreed to the project,” Stone told Empire magazine.
The soundtrack will revisit the electronic eighties kitsch of Giorgio Moroder but with Amy’s f * cked up slurring vocals included.
“We wanted someone who looked and talked the part. Amy Winehouse fits like a glove,” Jose Rodriguez, one of the casting directors for the movie told Empire magazine.   There are even rumours of surprise cameo appearances from Al Pacino himself, as well as gore and violence expert, Quentin Tarantino who is tipped to appear in another spectacular chainsaw scene.
“You know what? F * ck you! How about that?” “Scarface with Pacino was hardcore, but the movie with Amy Winehouse will make the first film look like a nuns tea party in a convent. We had a preview screening for a few scenes last week in the studio and many in the audience were visibly sick, some even vomited into their popcorn. We’ve also had to utilise automatic projection machines because no projectionist could last for more than three minutes watching that movie. Amy is going to win us an Oscar for this for sure. I’ve never seen Quentin Tarantino actually scared for his life, he spent a night with Amy Winehouse for research purposes — the dude was crying like a baby at the end of the night,” Stone added.
The new film starring Amy Winehouse is set for release in August of 2009 and will be distributed by Miramax."
New FBI Files Reveal Michael Jackson Faked Moonwalk,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2070-new-fbi-files-reveal-michael-jackson-faked-moonwalk.html,2009,"For years conspiracy theorists and other crazies have been talking about how Michael Jackson faked the moonwalk.
“We’ve been talking about it for frickin’ years. The lighting was all wrong and there were multiple shadows in the footage. We knew it was faked and now these FBI files have proved us right goddamn it,” Lars Emmereich, a conspiracy theorist from Lake Utah told the BBC.
The newly released FBI files reveal that Jackson would perform the moonwalk on a specially designed greased up stage with an intricate network of moving wooden compartments connected to a pulley system. There would be teams of up to thirty stage hands who would pull ropes through trolleys and squirt grease onto the stage so the star could effortlessly seem to glide backwards.
Conspiracy theorists had been posting on websites and bulletin boards on the internet for many years before the amazing revelations came to light yesterday.
“I feel like a whole big weight has been taken off my shoulders. I salute the FBI for this expose, my tinfoil hat nearly fell off when I read it in the papers,” Mr Emmereich added."
Channel 4 Pilots New Racist Reality Show,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1060-channel-4-pilots-new-racist-reality-show.html,2007,"Endemol, the company behind ‘Big Brother’, is pulling out all the stops for its new Channel 4 production.
In it, celebrities choose who gets saved and who dies. The snag?
The celebrities chosen for the new Baywatch style reality show are known racists and when given a choice, for example, between saving a cute brown skinned three-year-old girl or a white skinned middle-aged overweight tourist they have to make snap decisions.
In the case of one of the contestants, Danielle Lloyd, the latter was her choice and the brown skinned girl drowned horribly when Danielle chose to save the white man who could swim.
The celebrity contestants were all housed in a luxury tropical island complex for four weeks and trained to be lifeguards by real Californian lifesavers.
Other celebrity contestants are the Goody family and Jo O’Meara.  The production will air in March and will be presented by football racist, Ron Atkinson."
President Obama to Appear on MTV Cribs From White House,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1526-president-obama-to-appear-on-mtv-cribs-from-white-house.html,2008,"MTV Cribs is set to pay Barack Obama a cool $3 million for him to feature the White House in an episode that will blow all of the previous episodes of Cribs to the kerb.
“The Obama episode of Cribs will make any other low-life pimp rapper’s gold laminated house look like a goddamn carboard box underneath a bridge somewhere in the Bronx. This Crib from the White House with Obama will be the mother of all Cribs, you know what i’m sayin’?” Lou Panatanka, an MTV executive said.
Once Obama is in the White House he will put a jacuzzi in every room including the Oval room, he will have chandeliers all over the place, the best Italian marble floors shipped from Italy and will install a full size basketball court in the White House back garden.
There are even plans for his own private mosque to be built in the East Wing facing Mecca where he can perform his daily prayers in quiet solitude away from the cameras.
The Pentagon planning committee have already received plans for minarets to be built on all four points of the White House, however, this may seem to be too blatantly Islamic and may have to be cut from Obama’s overall plans for change.
“Obama is fly. Once he’s in the White House he’s going to make some serious changes.
“He’s even thinking of buying a few Hummers for the presidential driveway and a bling mobil that will make the most garish bad-taste rapper blush with embarrassment,” Mr Panatanka added."
Plans for US Theme Park in Iraq Leaked Online,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1085-plans-for-us-theme-park-in-iraq-leaked-online.html,2007,"Computer-generated projections of the nearly completed, heavily fortified Jihadi Land compound in Iraq were posted to the Web site of Burger Schmalt Wisney Inc., an American architectural design firm for theme parks that was contracted to design the massive fun park in the Iraq capital.
The post was removed by the company from its Web site Thursday shortly after being contacted about it by the State Theme Park Department.
“We work very hard to ensure the safety and security of our employees overseas,” said Gogozalos Gallogoogos, a  State  Theme Park Department spokesman. “This kind of information out in the public domain detracts from the fun effort and is a darn right stinker.”
The 10 images included a scheme of the overall layout of the theme park, plus depictions of individual buildings including the theme park rides, office annexes, the Jihadi mouse security post, swimming pool, slaughter house, jihadi mouse and deputy mouse’s residences as well as the prison torture compound.
U.S. Theme Park officials said the posted plans conformed at least roughly to conceptual drawings for the new park, which is being built on the banks of the Tigris River behind huge fences due to fears insurgents without tickets will attack when tickets are all sold out.
Janice Simonen, a spokesman for  Burger Schmalt Wisney Inc , declined to discuss the accuracy of the images posted online.
“In terms of commenting whether they’re accurate, obviously we wouldn’t be commenting on that because we don’t want people whoever they are or would care to think they are to know whether they’re accurate or not or may seem to be accurate or not know for security reasons,” he said.
Burger Schmalt Wisney Inc  parent company, the giant contractor Halliburton, said the plans had been very preliminary and would not be of help to potential theme park competitors.
“The actual information that was up there was purely conjectural and conceptual in nature,” said Chibo Mamakin spokesman for Halliburton. “Google Earth could give you a better snapshot of what the site looks like on the ground.”
Some U.S. Theme Park officials acknowledged that damage may have been done by the postings and used expletives like “fu*k”, “sh*t” and “motherf*ckers” to describe their personal reactions, but downplayed the overall risk posed by whooping like chimps in a dodgem car.
“People are eventually going to figure out where they can get tickets for ‘Jihad Land’, but you don’t have to draw them a map, it’s like a treasure hunt kinda thang” said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the theme park project.
The construction site in Baghdad is under heavy guard and treated with extreme secrecy. It is off-limits to all but those with special silly pink hats, surrounded by tall, concrete blast walls and impossible to see except from the air.
The $592 million theme park, on a chunk of prime real estate acquired by Rosco Bonds and is two-thirds the size of Washington’s 
National Mall, is expected to be completed in September. The images posted on the Web site show that it will be a spacious and comfortable facility, albeit with some damn dangerous rides.
Identified as the “Jihadi Land Theme Park” the images show ‘Jihadi Land’ themes like:  Jihad Rollercoaster,  A functioning prison modeled on Abu Ghraib,  Jihadi Land IED Alley,  Jihadi ‘pass the parcel’ Warehouse,  Detention Camp Dwarves,  Jihad Mountain,  Osama Island,  Barbed Wire Wall Frontier Land and Hook Island.
“In total, the 600-acre theme park will include over three hundred buildings, including one classified secure torture chamber and housing for over 1500 special ticket holders,” the Web site boasts."
Madonna to Adopt New Husband,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1394-madonna-to-adopt-new-husband.html,2008,"Pop megastar Madonna is to adopt a new husband from an underprivileged part of the world.
The mum of four will travel to Africa and test males to see if they are worthy of adoption by the great Madonna.
The stringent testing will involve mega sessions in bed with the 56 year old woman and rigorous body examinations to determine durability.
“Madonna will personally test all the males to see if they’re up to scratch. Her libido is immense and she sometimes needs to be sated 10 – 15 times a day,” a spokesman for her Management company told us.
The Madonna adoption convoy left London three weeks ago and is slowly snaking its way through Mali after passing through Morocco then cutting through Mauritania.
If Madonna does not adopt a husband by that time they will carry on across to Chad passing through Niger then down to Gabon, Angola and Zaire.
By that time if she still has not found an adopted husband they will carry on to Tanzania, Mozambique then finally ending in Lesotho deep inside of South Africa.
African countries have been bristling with advertising announcing the “Madonna New Husband Adoption Convoy”.
Ngiri Omdongo from Zaire has set about preparing his friends for the Madonna meetings that will take place next month: “She is like royalty for us and if she picks one of us it will bring great riches and honour to our village. We will be living in London and Beverly Hills and drive fast cars woo hoo! The only painful thing we have to do is service the old granny every few hours, yes we can deal with it!”
One of the requirements Madonna has stipulated is that her new husband like her previous one, has to walk three steps behind her whenever they travel together and that they have to be quiet if addressed, only speaking if their opinion is required.
“She will still be looking to adopt a young one, but this time from an African background. It will also be good for little Banda who will have someone to play with,” the spokesman for her Management company reiterated."
Shock as Ageing Rock Star Leaves Wife for Teen Temptress,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1411-shock-as-ageing-rock-star-leaves-wife-for-teen-temptress.html,2008,"All the newspapers have been bristling with news that an ageing rickety old rock star left his wife after 30 years of marriage to go off with a young girl.
“Tight like a ..”
“This is a complete surprise and we would never have seen it coming. I mean, who would have thought an ageing rock star resembling a wrinkled old prune would hanker after some young hot tight flesh that bounces to the touch as opposed to something that resembles an old leathery corpse?” Reggie Newby, the rock star’s chauffeur told one of the tabloid papers yesterday.
The news that the rock star decided to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh with a young, hot piece of ‘chicken’ also comes with the news that the pope likes to hang out in Catholic churches and the Queen is rather partial to hanging around Buckingham Palace. Apparently, bears like to defecate in the woods too."

Another 'Cutesy' Hollywood CGI Film Released,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2494-another-cutesy-hollywood-cgi-film-released.html,2010,"“We’ve got another Hollywood movie release with cutesy CGI characters, American voices and American mannerisms,” Ernie Schlitz, a studio executive at Fox Studios told Film Weekly.
Cinema-goers in Paris, France were astounded by the new movie.
Pierre Gitanes, 14, on his half-term holidays said: “Every week they release a new film with the same tired old American actors’ voices and really dumb f * cking CGI penguins or some other stupid creature. They walk around the screen going ‘Yo, yo, whassup?’ or ‘Du-u-u-u-de!’ after the 380th CGI film release this year I just sat in my seat and wept.”
In Britain, many cinemas held a day of mourning as another cutesy Hollywood CGI film release hit the towns and cities.
“We just had another cutesy American CGI film release. I even had one man slit his wrist in the back and last week we had a hanging,” Freddie Arbunckle, the manager at the Bexleyheath Odeon told the Mirror."
Palace Revises Prince Philip Royal Variety Words,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1730-palace-revises-prince-philip-royal-variety-words.html,2009,"Scowell claimed that he was snubbed by the Queen and insulted by the Duke after 
  appearing at the Royal Variety Show.
A spokesman for Buckingham Palace denied that the Duke had called the 
  music and television promoter, who has amassed an estimated fortune of £112m 
  through shows like American Idol, The Z-Factor, and Britain’s Got Talent, a “sponger”.
“The Duke of Edinburgh categorically did not call Mr Scowell a ‘sponger’. He must have misheard. Everyone knows Mr Scowell is a ‘c*nt’. He has said that he called Scowell a ‘c*nt of the highest order’,” he said.
“Mr Scowell may have misheard the Duke, he has a very soft voice, especially when addressing scum.”
But Scowell’s version of events is supported by fellow Z-Factor judge and supreme c*nt of all time, Piers 
  Moron, who was also present during the exchange in 2007. In his new piffling book, 
  the former newspaper editor, and supreme shitbag, describes hearing the Duke jokingly call Scowell a “c*nt of the highest order and moribund banal exploiter of people with no talent for profit and ridicule”.
Moron said: “I can categorically say it happened. I know because I am a stupid c*nt of the highest order myself. If we all have to 
  trudge off to the courts to discuss the matter, I’m available, because as you all know already, I’m a snivelling little weasel and shister snitch.”
Yesterday, Simon Scowell and Piers Moron, who were attending another Z-Factor audition, accepted that they may have misunderstood the Duke’s words and were very apologetic.
“I am extremely sorry for making a big stink about the Duke of Edinburgh’s words. I agree with what he called me and am even considering getting a big ‘c*unt’ tattoo on my forehead, although, whenever people see me that is what they think anyway. I would like it to be official,” Mr Scowell said from the Z-Factor studios.

The bored looking couple arrived on a horse drawn carriage to the synagogue for the £4 million wedding where they were married by a Rabbi under a chupa for all of two minutes.
“It was a beautiful ceremony, and the pair didn’t even look into each others eyes. All around there were sighs of ‘Oy vay’ and ‘Oh vez mear’. Two minutes of utter silence passed before they said they wanted a divorce on the grounds of boredom. You know how this new generation is, all about low attention spans and investment banking,” Gilda Goldberg, a guest at the wedding said.
Immediately after the divorce was announced, all the guests ran towards the wedding cake, which cost a whopping $65,000.
“There was a stampede rush to the wedding cake where people jumped right in there so they could get a slice and sell it in the streets or ebay for a massive markup,” Ron Jeremy, another guest at the wedding said.
Chelsea’s father, Bill, was nowhere to be seen but there were some reports that he was consummating the marriage for the two in a backroom with a number of bride’s maids."
Madonna Prepares to Buy Malawi After Adoption Denial,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1738-madonna-prepares-to-buy-malawi-after-adoption-denial.html,2009,"A judge faced down Madonna yesterday and rejected her petition to adopt four-year-old Mercy James.
Esme Chombo’s dramatic ruling was announced on the steps of 
Lilongwe’s High Court in a rainstorm shortly before 11am local time 
yesterday.
The law, she said in her ruling, stated that an 
adoption could not be permitted to anyone who was not resident in 
Malawi, noting that Madonna had jetted in just days prior to Monday’s 
hearing.
Madonna was not in court to hear the devastating ruling, though 
her lawyer, Alan Chinchilla, did attend – but he left through a back 
entrance after learning the news.
According to one source, Madonna screamed ‘Whaaaat! Do they know who I goddamn am? OK get my bankers on the line, we’re gonna buy this joint lock stock and barrel’ when he told her the judge’s decision.
Madonna was said to be absolutely furious after being denied her whim and she was so angry that she hurled her Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte 2000 at one of the Malawian servants attending her.
“If they want me to be a resident I’ll show them what residency means. I’ll buy this joint and there’s nothing you all can do about it. I’m gonna rename this place ‘Madonna Land’. No one ever says no to me..No one!” Madonna was heard yelling as her luxury private jet was seen shooting off back to New York.
Madonna who has already renovated her luxurious eight story home in London’s Mayfair in preperation for the adoption has already built a special area for the girl with jungle motifs on the walls so she can feel at home.
“She did the same thing for baby Banda who she snatched from his parents a few years ago. She will go to any expense to make her captives feel at home. She’s a really good mum although a bit controlling I must say,” an ex nanny told CBS news."

Britain’s Got Stabbing,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1358-britains-got-stabbing.html,2008,"Simon Scowell, who is making another 100 million pounds from his latest ‘talent’ show ‘Britain’s Got Stabbing’, has chosen this year’s winning teenage knife crew for Britain. Also sitting on the panel is the disgraced ex-newspaper editor Piers Moron.
Over the past six weeks they have whittled down the finalists from 400,000 hopefuls and after coming this far the finalists truly deserve their accolade.
The stage is set and the raw flesh on show is truly astounding.
‘Britain’s Got Stabbing’ gets off to a spectacular start when three people are savagely stabbed in the audience. The blood trickles down the studio steps and even reaches the stage where the main stabbing display takes place.
Up first for the final night are the Bracknell crew who are a very talented bunch of twelve year olds.
They show their prowess by completing an egg and knife race in under three minutes, the finale of their presentation culminates in taking out an old lady’s kidney with the precision of a trained surgeon whilst calling her a ‘slag’. Their tools of choice are sharpened kitchen knives borrowed from their homes.
Second place goes to the Leeds crew who can drink Aldi Wine by the gallon and gut unsuspecting pedestrians by the bus load.
They manage to drink 25 cartons of cheap wine each and still are able to stab with precision. One of the crew, Lee Feral, 14, plunges a 7 inch blade into a camera man’s back and removes his liver. The Leeds crew then throw the still spitting liver into the jubilant audience as Simon and Piers applaud fiercely.
Their wondrous presentation ends with the camera man’s bloodied twitching torso projectile vomiting over the audience as he slumps to the floor dead as a dodo.
The audience laps it all up and cheers them off stage to rapturous applause.
It’s the Enfield Massive, and they know their stuff. They show off their sparkling new Argos kitchen knives, which of course are made in China and are as blunt as a rusty old bread knife.
The bluntness of the blades are demonstrated on one of the shows researchers when he is set upon by the whole Enfield crew and slowly gutted in 8 minutes 34 seconds. His entrails are then thrown on the floor where the Blue Peter dog from the adjoining studio laps them up hungrily.
Simon Scowell applauds furiously at the sight because not only have the Enfield Massive carved the poor researcher up but he is still alive – such is the precise knife-work of the crew even with a blunt instrument.
Kevin, 13 and Lee, 15, spot another opportunity to show off their superior carving equipment by embedding the knives deep in Piers Moron’s back. This wonderful act brings the house down in frenzied applause replete with standing ovations and severed limbs being thrown in celebration onto the stage as a show of approval.
This genius denouement is applauded by all and Simon Scowell gives it a full thumbs up. Piers Moron is also applauding wildly and still attempts to flash his smarmy fake smile despite having six large kitchen knives embedded deep in his back, the blood gushing out of him arcs up like a curious fountain of claret and sprays members of the audience much to their delight.
The Enfield crew win the £100,000 and have now been granted the additional accolade of 
performing in front of the Queen at Buckingham Palace.
Britain sure has a lot of talented stabbing teens this year and The Daily Squib is very proud to be part of this great nation’s talent pool – of blood."
Lady GaGa's New Look Includes Leg Amputation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2263-lady-gagas-new-look-includes-leg-amputation.html,2010,"The pop singer endured the operation so that she could look increasingly ‘different’, and it seems she has achieved her objective. Her record company even paid for the operation and her new video will showcase the new image when filming begins in three weeks.
“This is the latest fashion I’m starting and you can see that I’m a world leader when it comes to wacky and weird shit huh. Next month after I recover from the surgery I hope to have the other leg amputated or maybe my arm, hmm…which one should I amputate next?” Lady GaGa said on MTV yesterday whilst hopping around the studio.
“Cosmetic Amputation Surgery” According to pop music experts, Lady GaGa has pioneered a new trend in pop acts who want to cash in on the amputations.
“Just think how cool it would be if other mediocre pop acts were to amputate parts of their bodies? You could have headless wonders singing along to their latest template RnB nonsense drum tracks or maybe legless f * cktard bimbos being ferried around in wheel chairs or makeshift carts. Personally, I think this new trend is a godsend, and I’d be first in line to chop off that untalented c * nt Robbie Williams’ head or how about that awful vulgar tart, Paris Hilton. I think this GaGa bird is onto something, innit,” Ronald Schweiner, a music journalist for Melody Maker remarked.
Veteran pop act, Madonna has already shown an interest in the new craze and has vowed to have both of her unsightly arms amputated, and in an extra twist, donated to science."

main stage last night.
The event was opened by American R’n’B 
heavyweight Flusher, who got off to a bad start when he told the crowd 
how delighted he was to be playing in Manchester.
Speaking to DJ 
Jo Whiley about her set at the two-day free festival, Madonna said: “The autotune machine was working great – that’s what people come to hear – we also had a few record decks on stage and my troupe of gay dancers.”
Revellers were delighted to see Madonna flouting her body after many years of gruelling exercise and hormone treatments.
“Madonna was positively ripping the stage apart and striding around like a gladiator. At one point the autotune broke down and her real voice came through the amplifiers – yes, her real voice is actually very low almost like Barry White,” music reviewer for Melody Maker magazine, John Troubridge wrote.
More than 500,000 people 
applied for 30,000 tickets, the biggest response yet generated by the 
Big Weekend, which is in its third year. Also playing were Fluffy, The Ceiling, and the Pratellis."

So we thought that he was going to do a bit of mind reading for his act, something along that line,” one of the judges, Pierce Moron told the Sun.
After getting up on stage the talented 23-year-old man pulled out an old World War II revolver and blew his brains out all over the judges and audience, causing many to flee in panic.
Judges, Amanda Holden and Pierce Moron got the brunt of the brains, a sliver even finding Ms Holden’s pouting cleavage.

The transformation was astounding say his lawyers. All it took were a few deadly squirts of the dastardly DNA concoction and Mr Batts was in a plastic surgery parlour getting a nose surgery for the fifteenth time in a week; his face peeled and a frightwig surgically fitted onto his head. He claims that he was also uncontrollably drawn to hang around school gates wearing a dirty mac.
“I was going around with an empty can of soda filled with red wine called Jesus Juice. I built a circus in my back yard replete with half starving animals and a big fuckin’ Peter Pan statue in the middle. My wife left me and I lost everything, I don’t blame my wife for leaving with my four kids because I was by then trying to dangle the poor blighters out of the window from the third floor,” Mr Batts sobbed into his prison issue handkerchief.

What was tipped as a major turning point in Islamic Western relations has now turned into a farce of epic proportions with even President Obama getting involved.
“I keep getting Middle Eastern leaders phoning me on the hotline praising Paris Hilton for her  conversion to Islam . I then try to explain to them who Paris Hilton is, but they don’t get it,” a frustrated Barack Obama relayed through his press office.
The former glamour model and ex-heiress, who has slept with a reputed 12,000 people so far, seems to be finally reaching enlightenment and celebrated her spiritual journey yesterday by splashing out on a pair of $8,000 shoes.
She met former felon, Bodhidharma Mahatma Ibn Himar  during the same retail therapy session at the famous Rodeo Drive shopping area in Beverly Hills and was convinced to join his Buddhist sect.
“I think this time this is the right religion for her. Although I have to say she has been through about 23 religions and cults this year alone,” her sister, Nicky Hilton told TMZ.

For a long time, airports have been using sirens piped through speakers to scare away birds in case they fly into planes engines and cause a crash.
“At least her voice is now being used for something useful instead of battering peoples eardrums in concerts, we can scare away birds and avoid fatal plane crashes,” Mr Trimble said.
In addition to UK airports using the pop diva’s voice to scare away birds from runways, there is widespread interest from airport authorities around the world.

Michael Jackson to Star in Thriller Remake As Zombie,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1669-michael-jackson-to-star-in-thriller-remake-as-zombie.html,2009,"This time around Michael Jackson, otherwise known as ‘Wacko Jacko’, is to be featured in the 2009 remake of Thriller as a zombie throughout the whole video.
John Landis of ‘American Werewolf in London’ fame is also set to return to the directors chair even though he is currently suing Jackson for millions of dollars worth of unpaid royalties.
“I’m suing Michael at the moment for loss of earnings, but we still speak to each other on the set. The other day I slapped Michael on the back and part of his nose fell off and onto the floor. We like to joke and have fun. The son-of-a-bitch owes me millions and he better pay me my moth*rf*ckin’ money or I will tear him a new 
a**hole!”
Back From the Grave
For the role, Jackson will not be required to have any special zombie makeup but will just turn up on set as is. The rest of the zombie cast all have to spend six hours each day putting on makeup and special prosthetics. Jackson has been spared this time consuming task and is glad to be in the enviable position of just turning up, shooting scenes, then retiring to his trailer to play with the children.
“We’re all so jealous of Mikey, I mean the guy just turns up and he fits right in with the scene. The original Thriller music video had Jackson as a zombie for only a small part of it. This time he is going to be a full time zombie because he is just so realistic. The other day, John Landis, our director wanted pieces of flesh to fall off some of the zombies faces. It was a nightmare scene for the special effects guys and we spent half the day trying to sort the scene out. So, John sends for Michael in his trailer. He turned up and filmed the scene. Boom! Done! There were parts falling off Michael’s face like we never seen before. Frankly the guy’s a genius,” assistant director, Billy Ray Duke, told Screen Magazine.
Jackson fans all over the world have been awaiting the new Thriller remake with feverish anticipation."

Michael, real name Georgios Panayiotou, revealed his delight at the prospect of being jailed: “I’ll actually enjoy it.

Captured on Camera: Madonna Meets Up With Secret Grandson,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1665-captured-on-camera-madonna-meets-up-with-secret-grandson.html,2009,"No one knew Madonna was a grandmother, not even her ex-husband Guy Richie. That is until now when the Daily Squib can reveal the dramatic moments when her Royal Madgeness finally got to meet her long lost Brazilian grandson.
“Back in 1979 she slept with a Brazilian dude named Marco Estevez who said he could make her famous. Of course that was a lie and he used that like all the other guys to get Ms Ciccone into bed. Well, she had a secret child with Marco and that child’s name was Jaco who grew up to be a drummer in a samba band in Rio. Sadly Madonna’s son never made it past 23 and was killed in a bar fight in Sao Paolo. The thing is, he had a son and his name was Samuel Jaco Estevez. That is who Madonna is finally meeting. This is an incredible moment in pop history. No one else knows about this and this news will rock the media to its core,” Jose Mancino Vasquez, a pop genealogist revealed to the Daily Squib.
The secret meeting was documented by celebrity photographer Carlos Hemingway. The photos will also be published in a special commemorative book featuring the story of Madonna’s wonderful discovery.
There was shock back in Britain with Madonna fans congregating outside her UK record company headquarters in Harlesden, North West London.
Kia Munter, 45, has been a keen Madonna fan for the past 40 years and was visibly excited at the news: “I been a Madonna fan for many years now and I probably know more about her than herself. Now they’ve discovered her secret Brazilian grandson? I can’t believe this? It’s wonderful news, I hope she’s happy with discovering her grandson. Amazing news.”
The book will reveal a brief incite into Madonna’s discovery of her grandson and her times with him in Brazil.
Madonna has apparently taken to her role as a grandmother with great relish and is enjoying her new role thoroughly.
“She spent some time in Brazil with her grandson. The book documents this and illustrates the themes and intrigue of finally getting to know her only grandson after many years of not knowing he even existed,” Luis Tavares, the ghost-writer for the project told the Daily Squib.
‘My Secret Grandson’ by Madonna will be released in March  on the same day as Madonna’s new album called ‘My Pet Gigolo’."

“Thank you, thank you. I’ve just had my arse felt by a 53-year-old van driver. George would be proud. Come now ladies, wouldn’t you all like to have casual encounters like us gay men?” Mr Fry smuggly quipped before sitting down in front of a urinal to sign some of the books that are now selling like hot turds nestled on the edge of a toilet seat.
Many women travelled across the country to finally meet Mr Fry and thank him for liberating them from the shackles of chastity.
“I’ve read his book and as a result I now go to Hampstead Heath every night and have sex with complete strangers. That’s why I now have AIDS and Gonorrhea. I came to have my book signed by Stephen today and thank him especially for inducting me into the ways of gay boys like him,” Elaine Pritchard, a librarian from Wood Green told the Daily Mail.

Madonna to Adopt Bungling Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1741-madonna-to-adopt-bungling-italian-pm-silvio-berlusconi.html,2009,"According to media reports emanating from Italy and the NATO summit in France, the Italian PM will be adopted by Italian American pop star, Madonna as her new mascot after catching her eye on news reports.
“Madonna called me up last week and said she was watching the news whilst doing one of her gruelling six hour workouts. She said she saw Berlusconi on the news making a total fool of himself and how much she liked the idea of adopting the idiot. She told me to get him immediately and any price would do. Because of her being denied another African pet maybe it would be time to look a little closer to her home roots,” Madonna’s personal assistant, Jane Vahgeina, told Reuters.
Madonna has already made preparations in her eight story Kensington mansion for the Italian prime minister.
“Madonna who will adopt her fellow Italian has already built a special salon for Silvio to play in. It will include lots of mobile phones to talk on whilst important dignitaries are waiting for him on the red carpet and a lifesize model of the Queen of England so he can shout in her ear at all times,” her press secretary revealed to the News of the World.
Italians are known for their “love of life” and are renowned for their loud, colourful personas but Silvio Berlusconi is known to transcend this stereotype in every way.
His wonderful bungling moments include telling a German MEP that he “resembled a concentration camp guard” and also complimenting Barack Obama on his “suntanned skin”.
The reaction from most Italians was encapsulated in a newspaper story quote for  La Repubblica : “ She can have him because frankly he’s an embarrassment to us Italians. He is more like Mr Magoo than Mr Cool.”"
Madonna to Adopt New Husband in Africa,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1517-madonna-to-adopt-new-husband-in-africa.html,2008,"Pop megastar Madonna is to adopt a new husband from an underprivileged part of the world.
The mum of four will travel to Africa and test males to see if they are worthy of adoption by the great Madonna.
The stringent testing will involve mega sessions in bed with the 56 year old woman and rigorous body examinations to determine durability.
“Madonna will personally test all the males to see if they’re up to scratch. Her libido is immense and she sometimes needs to be sated 10 – 15 times a day,” a spokesman for her Management company told us.
The Madonna adoption convoy left London three weeks ago and is slowly snaking its way through Mali after passing through Morocco then cutting through Mauritania.
If Madonna does not adopt a husband by that time they will carry on across to Chad passing through Niger then down to Gabon, Angola and Zaire.
By that time if she still has not found an adopted husband they will carry on to Tanzania, Mozambique then finally ending in Lesotho deep inside of South Africa.
African countries have been bristling with advertising announcing the “Madonna New Husband Adoption Convoy”.
Ngiri Omdongo from Zaire has set about preparing his friends for the Madonna meetings that will take place next month: “She is like royalty for us and if she picks one of us it will bring great riches and honour to our village. We will be living in London and Beverly Hills and drive fast cars woo hoo! The only painful thing we have to do is service the old granny every few hours, yes we can deal with it!”
One of the requirements Madonna has stipulated is that her new husband like her previous one, has to walk three steps behind her whenever they travel together and that they have to be quiet if addressed, only speaking if their opinion is required. She has also stipulated that no ’emotional retards’ should apply, unfortuantely that rules out most men on the planet.
“She will still be looking to adopt a young husband, but this time from an African background. It will also be good for little Banda who will have someone to play with,” the spokesman for her Management company reiterated."

Unexpectedly a piece of phlegm lands on an old ladies hat and dribbles down her tweed overcoat. This is my first ever assignment at a Flower Show and even though I am heavily affected by hayfever I am glad to have been given this reportage job for the Squib.
What a wonderful opportunity to view some amazing English gardens. The colours of the rainbow could not describe the myriad of flavours that attack my visual and nasal palate. We have rotten vegetables over there, bin bags overflowing with rubbish over here, and even an old mattress abandoned amongst the nettles up on yonder.
A positively astounding  panoply of crisp packets and pizza cartons amongst the weeds. I see across the border in Row A there is even an old cat carcass which seems to be striking a pose in its skeletal state alongside the used condoms.
Again I sneeze as the fumes of rancid beer and fat from a rusty frying pan hits me like a ten tonne lorry. It is not that I am unused to the smell because I am an Englishman after all but this time the odour of rotten eggs is reminiscent of the sulfur farts from Beelzebub’s bumgut.
I am of course describing the winner for this year, the flamboyant character Robert Maxwell’s wonderful display. It seems the bin men have not been here for weeks and the flies that infest the area are truly magnificent. A true English masterpiece and well worth the entry fee. I would advise everyone to see the show this year.

Big Bird
One of the spectators at Harry’s Bar and Dance, Laura Ginster, 43, located on the popular Avda Palma de Mallorca, recalled the amazing incident:
“She like flew over all the way from America for a concert here and was bangin’ away on one of her autotune tunes.  When she bent over we thought we heard a fart, but no, it was her Lycra ripping. By ‘eck, she were giving birth right there on stage. I saw it with me own eyes, I tell you. Her eyeballs rolled back in the sockets and all we could see were the whites and she got into a trance state, like how I get just before I pick up my giro. Then this unholy sound came from her throat, like as if she were singin’ one of her records. I looked at me boyfriend, who I had just met three minutes ago, and we couldn’t believe it, the egg was comin’ out her bottom. Once the egg came out, we heard a puckering sound as her arse popped shut again, and the egg plopped onto the stage. It was a beautiful sight. What an artiste she is, the best talent I’ve ever seen since I saw that Jim Davidson down in Bodmin, innit.”
The Lady Gaga stunt has shocked the music world and MTV are even threatening to ban her videos from now on.
“After the egg was laid, one of her assistants ran onto the stage and rubbed the side of the egg with a feather duster and some polyunsaturated margarine. That’s when the egg hatched and a little chick emerged and started to chirp a Gaga song through a vocoder,” another audience member at the show revealed.
Eyewitness accounts at the show also reveal how Gaga then proceeded to lay eight more eggs from her posterior while she was playing the piano.
Some of the eggs that were secreted from Gaga’s anus were then broken on stage into a large frying pan and cooked by her personal chef to be shared around the stagehands and audience.
“I asked for my egg sunny side up. It was tasty beyond belief. I love my Gaga eggs,” Sam Tolleridge, 23, an audience member from Burnley, revealed to the Sun newspaper.
Gaga is also planning on opening her own hatchery in Illinois, USA, where she will sell her freshly laid eggs for $4,000 a piece."

Special taxation and examination rule maker, undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, was on hand to collect the cheque from the ailing fantasist living in cloud-cuckoo-land, JK Rowling.
“She’s given a million pounds to the Ministry of Nu-Labour! A ministry which has lined its own pockets with cronyism, sleaze, scandal and pure lies. They are the most incompetent purveyors of gross taxation, surveillance, waste, greed and hypocrisy we have ever seen. They claim to help the little man, the single parent and the poor. Yeah, by taxing them out of existence and taking away their homes and hospitals and ruining their lives. That Lord Gordomort has got a lot to answer for I tell you and here is JK Rowling endorsing him? I’ve just gone and burnt all her books. I hope she rots in hell, horrible traitor that she is,” Amy Lewis, 8, a previous JK Rowling fan told the Daily Prophet.
Lord Gordomort was very happy to receive the million pounds from the stupid and deluded JK Rowling. He is now going to use the money she gave him to cause more havoc by increasing surveillance even more on citizens and for taxing more poor people into the ground.
“Soon no one will be able to afford any food to eat or feed their children. JK Rowling can eat with her £600 million, but what about everyone else? Lord Gordomort, who Rowling has endorsed, is an evil Stalinist beast who is determined to punish every person in the land with his wasteful, over-taxing bureaucratic useless laws and his cutting down of all freedoms. He must be stopped or we are all finished,” a distraught Gryffindor student, Harry Potter told the Daily Prophet.
Indeed, this whole episode has been a very sad chapter and the Daily Squib offices worldwide have been party to many JK Rowling book burning sessions after hearing of her terrible betrayal.
“We’ve had muggles and wizards alike all turning up to burn JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books all of today. The queue is going round the block of children with the books in their satchels throwing them into the fire in disgust. We’ve got some very distraught children and parents here and they’re all crying their eyes out at the most profound betrayal by this woman, JK Rowling. If you read this, hope you’re happy with yourself. You’ve surrendered to Lord Gordomort and his vicious Ministry of Nu-Labour cronies,” Victoria Frobisher, another disgusted Gryffindor student, told the Daily Prophet newspaper."

Personally, I think he should have a large vagina sewn onto his head because to tell you the truth, Liam is a c * nt of the highest order,” Nicole Appleton, his long suffering wife told CBBC’s Newsround program.
The ailing popstar who made an utter fool of himself at the BRIT awards recently, is said to be relishing the opportunity to acquire the mammary gland on his head.
Dr. Giles Mumptington, who will operate on the star at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, spoke about the procedure: “First we will shave off his naff Southern ponce hairstyle, then we will peel back his scalp and stick a big mammary gland on it. We have already got the breast in storage after being donated by a nun who had no need for her tits anymore. The procedure should only take three or four hours to complete, that is if there are no complications.”
There were fears in the Oasis camp today that Liam could be mistaken for a policeman once the procedure is completed.
“Liam is a mentally retarded oaf with a very limited worldview, but I have to commend him on his latest action. It’s as if he’s slowly waking up to how people view him. I think that’s a step in the right direction and by having this t * t grafted onto his bonce he’s showing the world what an utter self-hating loser he really is,” his brother, Noel Gallagher told Melody Maker magazine."

Shit, how does her thin frame take it when she walks with those things on her feet? Does she wear flip flops? I need to cast her for my next alien flick. We won’t need CGI on her feet that’s for fuckin’ sure!”
Meanwhile, Mrs Beckham’s lawyers are preparing a dossier proving that her bunions are harmless and can co-exist safely with the general population.
“We are here to reassure the public that Mrs Beckham’s bunions are perfectly safe to ordinary people. All that folks have to do when they see her walking towards them is move aside for the bunions. It’s really that simple, then no one will get hurt,” Harry Snatch, from Fitch and Fitch Attorneys said."
New Irish Robin Hood Gladiator Movie Takes Box Office by Storm,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/2293-new-irish-robin-hood-gladiator-movie-takes-box-office-by-storm.html,2010,"“This time we’re taking money from the poor cinema audiences and giving it to the rich studio execs, a rich fat Aussie meathead and an even richer English director. Robin Hood has a noticeable paunch and speaks in the most ridiculous fake Irish accent you will ever hear. After watching this turkey, you’ll think that Kevin Costner is a genius on a par with Leonardo Da Vinci,” Arthur Finklestein, a Hollywood movie critic told Variety.
Cinema-goers were treated to the sight of the  fat  old Australian Robin Hood prancing around the forest shouting out “My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the McDonalds, General of the Burger King, loyal servant to the true KFC bucket, Colonel Sanders. Father to a murdered bun, husband to a murdered chicken leg.  And I will have my vengeance, in this Drive-In or the next,” in a very strange faux Irish accent.
Some of the audiences were rather annoyed and confused when exiting the cinemas yesterday.
“I want my f * cking money back. Robin Hood robbed me. Where’s the f * cking manager I want my money back right now,” one of the mugged cinema-goers said after watching the film."
Britney Escapes from UCLA Mental Institute,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1223-britney-escapes-from-ucla-mental-institute.html,2008,"BREAKING NEWS
The LAPD, Texas Rangers, SWAT, Navy Seals and Canadian Mounties have all joined the search for Britney Spears after she escaped through a tiny window in the maximum security mental wing of the UCLA hospital where she was being held.
After being committed to the UCLA mental asylum on Thursday, Ms Spears was deemed “Gravely Disabled” by the doctors.
Fernando Rodriguez, one of the hospital attendants, told the Daily Squib,  “We don’t know what time she escaped, but it was between her meds – between 4 and 5 in the morning. Oh lord! If she don’t take her meds it ain’t gonna be pretty y’all.”
The UCLA area has been besieged by thousands of photographers and news crews. The air is so thick with news helicopters that a midair collision is inevitable.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for a code Red 
Alert situation and is under mounting pressure to call in more state 
troopers from neighbouring states to calm the situation.
Britney, the ailing celebrity mime artist, apparently blew a gasket when she heard that her whole estate is now under the care of her divorced parents.
Britney’s father has already moved his trailer into the grounds of her mansion and her mother seeks to follow next week. The chickens and farm animals will also be shipped in with the extended family of 450 cousins, aunts, uncles and assorted offspring.
The Los Angeles area has been warned not to confront the crazed celebrity walking around talking gibberish with a fake cockney accent.
“She will probably run for the nearest Starbucks or drug store to buy laxatives and Red Bull. If anyone has any petite dogs, which are popular with celebrities, please keep them locked inside your homes. Do not confront Britney or offer assistance because you may be in severe danger – just dial 911 or run as fast as you can,” Officer Timpson from UCLA Police Dept. announced on the K-ROQ radio station last night.
Osama Lutfink, her manager, was fighting back tears at the thought of the pain and suffering poor Britney must be going through.
“I am a compassionate man and my heartfelt condolences go out to everybody who cares for her. We will restore her finances and accounts to their rightful place very soon — in my full control.”

World Record for Most Emergency Workers at One Incident Broken,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1206-world-record-for-most-emergency-workers-at-one-incident-broken.html,2008,"In true American overkill style, a crazed woman was stretchered off and taken away for mental evaluation by 438 paramedics all simultaneously lifting the stretcher into a single ambulance.
The incredible feat was also recorded by 2543 TV stations and attended by 28 helicopters, 154 fire trucks as well as 325 LAPD police vehicles setting multiple records.
The quiet gated community street was so full of Guinness World Record holders that it may go down as the most Guinness World Records broken in one area simultaneously.
Code 5150
The paramedic record involved 438 paramedics from three counties converging on the street. The crazed woman was then stretchered for a massive 20 meter distance to the ambulance and took an amazing 2 minutes 37 seconds.
The previous record of 197 paramedics and 229 police, emergency workers attending a single incident standing since 2003 at the Neverland Ranch was shattered yesterday.
“We never seen so many flashing blue lights in one goddamn place! I was in the act of teabagging my old lady when the proverbial hit the fan. It ruined our evening,” one of the angry and agitated neighbours said from his luxury villa next door.
It is true to say that some people are not too happy about having their evenings ruined by mass Guinness World Records being conducted under their very noses."
The Daily Squib Guide to Celebrity Perfumes,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1208-the-daily-squib-guide-to-celebrity-perfumes.html,2008,"Britney Spears, Mariah Carey and J-Lo are among the many celebrities who have launched their own fragrances. But what does one of the world’s top perfumers make of celebrity smells?
Daly Squib reporter Jane Constantine takes notes as she sniffs out the best – and the worst.
Already we have enjoyed the scent of Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, J-Lo, Sir Cliff Richard, Danielle Steel, Sarah Jessica Parker, Celine Dion, P-Diddy, Jade Goody, Naomi Campbell, Mel C, Mel B, Marilyn Manson, N-Sync, Jordan and Peter Andre and that timeless classic, Forever Krystle, by Dynasty’s own Linda Evans.
The arrival of Intimately Beckham, twin scents for David and Victoria, was akin to the arrival of backed up urine after a long night of getting pissed on cheap vodka. The Beckham’s stale smell of a Gentleman’s urinal in Picadilly was one of last year’s biggest sellers – David Beckham’s InStinkt sold out last Christmas.
The nose
Roja Ponce is a nose, one of the world’s finest perfumers. Who better to sample the recent fragrant celebrity offerings? Sitting in his little perfumerie in the lofty heights of Harrods, he surveys the clutter of bottles before him.
He begins with Intimately Beckham. David’s fares well: “The urine, the residue is actually rather good: stale tobacco, stale beer. It has an acrid note in it. It’s a potentially nice smell if you’re a frequent cottager like me. It has character, especially that distinct Armitage Shanks saveur,” he says. With better ingredients it would be “a very, very interesting scent”.
Alas, Victoria falls short of her husband: “Jesus Christ,” mutters Ponce. “It’s a transparent anal burst of colour on my palate. Quite soft in the background and the gaseous exchange is quite fresh – diarrhoea, methane and a hint of stale urine.” What it fundamentally lacks, he says mournfully, “is volume”.
Still, Lady V fares better than Naomi Campbell. “I’m sure I’ve seen that in my local sex shop,” he says archly, of Campbell’s undeniably phallic bottle. “That’s where I get my vibrators.” He inhales deeply. “That’s gorgeous. It’s exceptionally old-fashioned. Powdery cocaine, with white speckles of fecal matter, anal lube, old man’s ejaculate, something urinary …” and, ultimately, “coconut.” It is, he decides, the most sensual, but he offers a word of caution: “This would make me feel physically sick with adoration if I were sitting next to someone wearing it.”
Jade Goody’s Shhit rates little better. “This is a fragrance that takes its inspiration from a sweaty Working Man’s Club. It has this big soiled y-front shit stain theme running through it, and on top something to freshen it up.” Like lavatory bleach and a large Klingon Dingleberry swinging restlessly? “A wonderful essence of clotted blood and semen soaked tampons.”
What Britney Spears’ Curious loses in nose-wrinkling offensiveness, it gains in blandness: “To me, it smells like a smell, not a perfume. It is a chemically-enhanced, white trash intoxicant, cigarette-stained Cheetos and skid marks on her soiled panties – when she wears them of course.
“For me, it is an odour that has very little personality. It is,” he concludes, “taking hillbilly to a very extreme level.” And what of the fragrance name? “Curious is a very good name,” he observes, “but there is nothing to be curious about.” Paris Hilton’s eponymous debut fragrance is equally insipid and, like all the other fragrances gathered here, “owes more to the public lavatory and cheap industrial cleaners than to perfume”.
And so to Mariah Carey. “Quarter pounders with cheese and aromatic gherkins and a trail of putrid urine speckled with the smell of a menstruating woman. Whoever made it has been heavily inspired by the fragrances from McDonalds and Burger King.” Ponce is not immediately certain who Mariah Carey is: “I don’t know the appeal of the woman, but I think she could make a lot of money out of this, because the juice is very commercial.”
Ponce has kind words for Sarah Jessica Parker’s Lovely. “This is pretty,” he says immediately. “Enema set to 11, with fresh effluent from a tramp’s arse hole and traces of sweetcorn behind it.” With better ingredients, he maintains, Lovely could have been a classical fragrance. It is a prime example of the current perfume trend.
And finally, to J-Lo, Glow. “It’s a very simple fecal note,” Ponce says. “In a funny way, it’s a little bit old-fashioned, and the smell is reminiscent of a greasy Hispanic hair product schlepped onto the head.” It was J-Lo who kickstarted the celebrity perfume revival (which first began back in 1991 with Liz Taylor’s White Bird Droppings).
Why does Ponce think Glow proved so popular? “I don’t know why. Maybe because of her wonderful talents as an actress and songwriter.”"
Britney Spears Paparazzi Orgy Shock,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1217-britney-spears-paparazzi-orgy-shock.html,2008,"Just when you thought it could not get any worse for Britney, she has now been photographed by the paparazzi having an orgy at her mansion with paparazzi photographers.
There were queues of paparazzi waiting for their turn to ‘shag’ Ms Spears outside her Hollywood mansion all of Friday and Saturday.
Adnan’s success with bedding Britney has opened the floodgates for a debauched paparazzi orgy LA has never seen before.
“I’m so excited! I get to do Britney doggy style then sell the pics for a few thousand,” an ecstatic pap from the Splash agency, who can’t wait to make a  splash  over Britney’s ass, told the Squib.
According to the rules posted on the lamp post outside Britney’s mansion only 30 paparazzi are permitted to have sex with her at the same time, so this is why the buzzing queue stretches for three blocks.
You can hear the paparazzi discussing lens sizes and stalking techniques through the warm Los Angeles night air.
Every paparazzi in Los Angeles and California is in Britney’s street and some have even flown over from New York to get the chance of penetrating Britney.
“I flew in this morning, yeah, my whole agency is here. One of our guys Billy has already queued up four times and he still wants another crack at her loose oyster.”
Britney Spears has started a new craze amongst celebrities.
Sleeping with the paparazzi and allowing them to profit off the pictures. The new in-phrase is ‘exploitation therapy’."
Michael Jackson  Audition for Next Star Wars Film Unsuccessful,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1197-michael-jackson-audition-for-next-star-wars-film-unsuccessful.html,2007,"Jackson who is also being pursued by approximately 245 debt collectors all wanting large sums of money from him, is so desperate for cash that he turned up on set unannounced pleading for clemency.
Lucas who is not afraid of seeing wild looking alien creations was taken aback by Jackson and screamed out in surprise when the former King of Pop appeared out of a shadow.
“George screamed like a little girl when he saw Jackson come out of a shadow at him. I never seen George fazed like that. This is the same guy who has created some of the most fearsome creatures in celluloid history,” a production assistant working on the film told the Daily Squib.
Jackson may still get the part because of his scare factor however there are liabilities to his employ: his weak facial structure which is not possible to insure, the hundreds of people trying to recover debts from him all the time and there will be children on set."
Britney Spears to be Exorcised LIVE on MTV,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1220-britney-spears-to-be-exorcised-live-on-mtv.html,2008,"Britney Spears the ailing autotune celebrity has been ordered by the Catholic church and her keepers to undergo an exorcism.
The once-in-a-lifetime experience will be filmed live on MTV and broadcast all over the world.
After having 12 highly public nervous breakdowns in January, Ms Spears is slowly reducing the monthly frequency of her breakdowns from a high of 34 in December.
Pope Benedict himself has intervened on this sensitive matter and has ordered his chief exorcist to complete the harrowing task of casting out the devil and satan’s demons from Britney.
Britney has already tried the typical celebrity wishy-washy cults like Scientology and Madonna’s celebrity perversion of the real Kaballah, but these only perpetuated her illness and made her even more sick than she already is.
The Clenbuterol worked for awhile but the crystal meth and cocaine was a bridge too far. The rehab did not work and having the starlet chained down in an ambulance did not restrain her.
Adnan Ghalib, her paparazzi boyfriend, fears for his subject and has concerns that she may not complete her contractual obligations with him if the demons are not cast out soon.
“Her room is always very cold and there is a frost in the air. She speaks with many tongues, including a fake British accent and she levitates every few seconds. I am sick of the pea soup that is projectile vomited from her cussing mouth. Her eyes are red – is that normal?”
The Daily Squib reporter, Ebner Pazuzu, accompanied Ghalib and a bodyguard into the ailing celebrities room when she started speaking an ancient British dialect called ‘mockney’. After levitating above the bed for a few minutes, Britney regurgitated fifteen bags worth of Cheetos and a Starbucks Mocha with extra chocolate sprinkles onto our terrified reporter. Our reporter has since been given compassionate leave.
“She then started to walk down the stairs backwards on all fours. At first we thought she was practising a dance routine for a performance but when her head made a 360 degree turn we knew this was something else.”
MTV will broadcast the LIVE Exorcism this Friday at 8pm PST."
The Daily Squib Christmas Nintendo Wii Giveaway,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1198-the-daily-squib-christmas-nintendo-wii-giveaway.html,2007,"You’ve been trawling the internet, the shops and everywhere else for the Wii.
Well, now is your chance to get a Wii console for Christmas.
We can get you a Wii
The Daily Squib Wii offer is giving away one Wii console to one lucky person this Christmas.
You can now be the envy of all your friends and family and acquire one of the most sought after consoles of all time.
Nintendo is not able to meet the holiday demand and has pulled some 
advertising in order to not make the situation worse.
Nintendo will be offering customers 
who are unable to find a Wii for Christmas a deal where if they pay £250 now they may receive a Wii console by March if stocks permit.
Obviously this will not cut it for most holiday shoppers who are buying 
Wii’s on ebay for more than five times the going rate.
One Ebay customer recently bought a Wii with one controller for £880 (retail £179.99).
Online retailers have been capitalising on the Wii shortfall by marking up consoles and profiteering on the meagre supplies.
Wiin a Wii
Now for the details on how to acquire a Wii console exclusively available only from the Daily Squib Wii competition where one lucky winner will scoop the prize of the century (or even millennium).
To win the prize we have hidden one Wii console within a 2600 km length along the Northern Indian Subcontinent. North of this mountain belt lies the Tibetan Plateau (Qing Zang Gaoyuan). The Himalayas form the earth’s highest mountain region, containing 9 of the 10 highest peaks in the world and a Nintendo Wii.
The Wii console could even be on world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest (8,850 m/29,035 ft), which is on the Nepal-Tibet border; the second highest peak, K2 or Mount Godwin Austen (8,611 m/28,251 ft), located on the border between China and Jammu and KashmÄ«r, a territory claimed by India and Pakistan (so be sure to get the correct passes and visas); the third highest peak, KÄnchenjunga (8,598 m/28,209 ft) on the Nepal-India border; MakÄlu (8,481 m/27,824 ft) on the Nepal-Tibet border; DhaulÄgiri (8,172 m/26,811 ft) and AnnapÅ«rna 1 (8,091 m/26,545 ft) in Nepal; Nanga Parbat (8,125 m/26,657 ft) in the Pakistani-controlled portion of Jammu and KashmÄ«r; and Nanda Devi (7817 m/25,645 ft) in India.
The Daily Squib team utilised the services of veteran Himalayan explorer Richard De Winters to place the Wii console deep within the Himalayan region.
If you leave today, you will get to Nepal by Saturday. Just think, you could be having a frozen wii on some mountain peak for Christmas.
The Daily Squib Wii Christmas Competition winner will be announced on Christmas Eve. The Daily Squib is not liable for any deaths or serious accidents that may occur as a result of participating in the Wii competition. Daily Squib Wii Competition participants are liable for own costs to journey to the Himalayan mountain region, including life insurance and medical expenses."
Prince to Sue Own Shadow for Copyright Infringement,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1183-prince-to-sue-own-shadow-for-copyright-infringement.html,2007,"Prince’s shadow is being sued in a multi-million dollar lawsuit that may continue on for many decades.
Depending on the lighting, Prince’s shadow is not approved by the purple marvel’s dedicated troupe of  Paisley Park  copyright police and it seems this time his shadow’s number is finally up.
Prince’s shadow has been following him around since he was a tiny ‘lil’ toddler and has also followed him right up to his adulthood height of 2’5.
The ‘artist formerly known as and once was known to himself and others and is known now as TAFKAP or sometimes symbol’ is a musical genius and can play many instruments, including the ukulele.
Lawyers are to begin proceedings against Prince’s own shadow as early as next week. The shadow of Prince will then be ordered to either pay royalties backdated to Prince’s birth date or simply disappear. Prince has also brought in the services of the RIAA who will sue the offending shadow for copyright infringement as well.
Attorneys for Prince were working overnight drafting a proposal that will be filed at Minneapolis State Court in the morning.
Last week, Prince also sued his last remaining fan and ordered the lifelong fan to pay royalties for being a Prince fan – the ex-Prince fan now supports arch rival Michael Jackson instead.
Prince is also planning to sue his own sphincter but has disappeared so far  up it  that lawyers say this may be impossible to implement."
Britney Lost Virginity Late at 14,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1184-britney-lost-virginity-late-at-14.html,2007,"The pop mimer’s former lawyer, Ernie Ernie, made the allegations in an interview with an American tabloid magazine.
He claimed that Britney first had sex with Brad 
Jonestown, who she’d been seeing for fourteen years. Brad is not her first cousin or father which is customary for trailer trash in Louisiana. Brad who is only her second cousin, has seven toes on each foot and three ears.
Ernie also alleged that her relationship with Justin Analcake was 
a ‘PR exercise’ to portray Britney as a girl who has broken away from her trailer trash roots and made a success of her life.
When Britney first burst on to the autotune miming scene, 
she famously claimed to be a singer.
The magazine, US Sleaze, also contains additional allegations on top of those made by Ernie, which focus on the mimer’s past.
According to the magazine, the family only had one member marry outside of the Louisiana trailer park in which they have all lived and died for three centuries.
Britney Spears is the only one who managed to leave the trailer and finally marry out of the family with ‘celebrity-leach’ Kevin Cheddarslime.
It was reported that Britney’s family all have very interesting deformities due to centuries of inbreeding. Britney’s uncle Jake has 23 fingers on his left hand and is an impresario at the trailer park’s local bar. He plays the banjo with such dexterity that they call him the Eddie Van Halen of the bluegrass world.
Britney’s father/uncle Jim Bob was arrested in 1992 for selling illegal moonshine from his trailer. He is famous in the family for having an additional eyeball under his armpit and also has webbed feet.
At the time, a local newspaper said: ‘Britney lost her virginity late for these here parts. We usually have our girls married with five children by the age of 14.’
Britney is currently embroiled in a horrid custody battle over her two children, Billy Bob and Jim Bob, with ex-husband Cheddarslime."
Peter Fincham BBC1 Head Displayed at the Tower,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1156-peter-fincham-bbc1-head-displayed-at-the-tower.html,2007,"Mr Fincham, the ex-head of BBC1, has had his head displayed outside Traitors Gate at the Tower of London. Mr Fincham is the most high profile execution in recent years.
The Public execution was conducted on Tower Hill and was photographed by the famous photographer  Annie Liebowitz, who was  appointed  by her Royal Highness.
The occasion will be commemorated with a set of coins to be specially minted and sold from one of the last remaining post offices in England and Wales.
Television coverage of the event has already spread onto YouTube, the video sharing website, where 23 million views have already been registered in just a few hours.
The public execution was also viewed by millions worldwide as many TV companies vied for a prime position.
Susan Sontag, the eminent writer and  friend  of Liebowitz, will also be covering the execution and has been commissioned to write a large commemorative piece in the Sunday Times this week.
BBC executives were in hiding today somewhere in the North of England. However, they will be soon found and executed for their part in the treasonous plot.
Head on the Block
After the Minister offered the last rites, Fincham gave the executioner a fiver and forgave him.
Mr Fincham’s execution went smoothly and the executioner only needed six strokes of the blunt axe to detach his treasonous head.
This is only the fourth execution for this executioner and he performed admirably for such an inexperienced fellow.
The crowd enjoyed the display and taunted Mr Fincham with rebukes for the horrible TV Licence tax that is foisted on everyone in Britain.
Peter Fincham, who has committed treason against her Majesty, was allowed to say a few words to the baying crowd, but was stopped short by a boiled potato hitting him square on the forehead.
‘Crowngate’
After Fincham’s head was despatched, the executioner showed it to the crowd and then plonked it on a pike. It will be displayed at Traitors Gate for awhile, then moved to London Bridge when it gets too smelly and green.
Later on in the afternoon another executive, Stephen Lambert was hanged at Tower Hill. This time only a few people turned up because of his low status.
Her Royal Highness and other royal members viewed the days proceedings from the royal box away from the public.
The Queen has also declared a public holiday on Monday next week as well as abolishing the BBC TV Licence tax indefinitely. This wonderful news was met with merriment and joy across the nation.
In recent years BBC output has been torrid and banal, with very low quality ‘reality’ content. No one is going to miss any of the BBC’s vapid waste of taxpayer’s money ‘programming’.
‘Good riddance to bad rubbish,’ as they say."
Britney’s Yorkshire Terrier Rescued,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1154-britneys-yorkshire-terrier-rescued.html,2007,"Britney Spears’ dog Toto the Yorkshire Terrier may have to be taken into protective custody by the American animal rights group PETA.
Britney, who has been squeezing the dog very tightly in the last few days, seems to be having trouble composing herself in public. This may have something to do with losing custody of her children to her ex-husband a few days ago  for being a bad mother .
Yesterday, whilst in Starbucks picking up a Frappucino, she was seen squeezing the poor mutt so tight that its poor little tongue was hanging out and its eyes seemed to bulge out of its little head. When a photographer brought this to Britney’s attention, she finally relaxed her grip and continued snorting the Frappucino with the straw.
The dog has tried to escape the clutches of Britney a few times, but is always recaptured by her driver or bodyguard and then handed shivering back to its tormentor.
Some people in the crowds waiting to see Britney have taken to urging the poor dog to escape by shouting  “Run, Toto, Run!”"
Where to Find the Most Toxic Toys This Christmas,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1186-where-to-find-the-most-toxic-toys-this-christmas.html,2007,"Are you worried about buying toys without hallucinogenic chemicals laced all over them this year? With all of the recent media scaremongering of toys soaked in mind-altering substances, you may be wondering which toys have the best drug content for Christmas. Here is your guide to ensure that you and your loved ones have a safe, good trip-happy holiday season this year.
First, look for toys that are either made in China or Eastern Europe.
Toy junkies can scoop up drug-soaked toys from Chingro – Chingro Toy Production is based in Beijing, China.
Chingro takes seriously the quality and safety of the toxic chemical soaking process and uses 100% high quality PCP (Angel dust, Dusted parsley, Phencyclidine) to make their toys. Chingro offers a wide variety of toys including castles, airports, and 
figurines which are aimed at the true toy connoisseur category.
“Look mummy, I can fly!”
Legwoah has seen a recent resurgence in popularity. There are theme sets for toy junkies from all walks of life such as Star Wars (Mescaline and Gamma hydroxybutyrate with a twist of MDMA) and Mission to Mars (laced with LSD, Cocaine and Methamphetamine). Legwoah is primarily produced in drug factories deep in the bowels of communist China and also many Eastern European former Soviet Bloc countries. The effects of some theme sets are said to be so intense that there have been instances of toy junkies actually leaving on a trip to Mars and never coming back.
If you are shopping for a puzzle and aren’t sure what to buy, then consider purchasing a DummyDust Puzzle. DummyDust puzzles are some of the highest quality puzzles out there and each piece is soaked in a different hallucinogenic chemical that will whack you into the next zone. Completing a DummyDust puzzle is very rare because once you taste a piece, your altered state of consciousness will result in true kaleidoscopic wonders.  You will see amazing rainbows and colours that lift up through the puzzle. Time will stop for awhile as you realise that we are all tiny molecules in the universal mind and spectrum.
Are you looking for a big hit for a Christmas gift? If you are, then consider the toy beads from ChingChing Toys. These toys are made from the highest quality magic mushrooms grown specially in the mountain region of Hengduan China.
Animal trank
Monkey Dust Toys is another toy company that wants to keep you safe in the knowledge that you are getting a good hard dose. Instead of paint, all of their toys are coated with an opium based dye. When you put one of these toys in your mouth, worry not. You will be transported to wonderful mellow pastures of green. Because they use opium dye rather than paint, Monkey Dust Toys are very safe.
For toy junkie newbies, Hookah is another great Eastern European brand that manufactures toys that are free of paint, but full of Ketamine. These toys were endorsed by Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty and are safe.
PCPlease
Everyone prefers to buy toys that are made in China. The classic Stinky toy is still made in China and when smoked creates an interesting high reminiscent of skunk weed.
Companies that manufacture their toys in China are: Leaky Leak, Horse Tracks, Gorilla Biscuits, Chingro, Space Ball, and Happy Sticks.
Beware!
There are some Chinese-sounding toy brands that are produced in America. Goon Dust, Detroit Pink and Beam Me Up Scotty are all made in America. You will  not  get a single dose from these toys. You can always check the box of a toy to locate the country where it was made in if you are unsure.
Look out for the perfect high this holiday season. While not all toys from China contain suitably high doses of hallucinogenic chemical paint, many toy junkies are nervous about possibly purchasing a toy coated with real paint – no one wants a dud toy.
Use this guide to help yourselves have a safe ‘trippin’ happy season."
Britney’s Photoshoppers go on Strike,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1179-britneys-photoshoppers-go-on-strike.html,2007,"The dedicated team of photoshop artists and retouchers who have been instrumental in Britney’s media image were on strike today.
The twenty strong team are usually working 24 hours a day on their high-end Macs churning out doctored pictures of Britney, but for now are relegated to playing video games in their studio.
“I’ve had enough, man! We don’t get paid enough for this stuff. It used to be about a few alterations like a pimple here or there. She is unworkable now, she is so fu**ed up. No amount of photoshop can save her now,” Scott Wilson is head digital retoucher for the team and holds up a picture of Britney looking bloated, sweating and drugged up.
There seems to be no communication between the Spears management team either, adding to further frustrations.
Ms Spears goes through one manager per week and is currently looking for another one at the moment.
John Roberts recounts the ‘good ol’ days’, “I was there in the beginning when Britney was wearing her school uniform and miming to the songs on MTV. Now she can’t even mime right, plus she looks like a cross between Ron Jeremy and a trailer-trash two bit hooker on Meth.”
“Our team has worked on digitally creating tropical rainforests and ancient Rome from scratch, but Britney is the biggest challenge we have ever had, and i’m sorry to say we gave up on this one.”
Speaking from their LA offices on Wiltshire, the team are now looking for other work."
OJ Simpson to Perform Prison Puppet Shows for Inmates,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/1150-oj-simpson-to-perform-prison-puppet-shows-for-inmates.html,2007,"Nothing better to keep killers and robbers at bay in an overcrowded hell-hole prison than a lovely Sing Sing hand puppet show.
OJ is practising for the 3 hour daily shows he will provide when he is sentenced later on in the month for a life term in jail.
“I am very excited to have the opportunity to express my creative side with these puppet shows. The main character of the show is called Ron and the other character is called Nicole. As the shows go on I will introduce other characters to the mix.”
The All Star puppet shows will be held in the main mess hall of the  Correctional Facility  where there will be an impromptu stage setup for OJ to perform.
OJ is also all set to tour the varied prison populations in North America with his All Star puppet show when he will be transferred from time to time.
The next 40-50 years in prison will be all the time OJ Simpson will need to refine his show and perfect his wonderful art.
Unfortunately, you will have to be incarcerated in the US prison system to enjoy the shows and they will not be allowed outside.
So, unless you’re into getting your arse buggered in the showers for picking up the soap, it is best to steer clear of being in the audience of an OJ puppet show in jail."
