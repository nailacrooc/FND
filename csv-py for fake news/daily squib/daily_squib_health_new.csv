Brian Blessed to Become Regular Fixture in All Maternity Wards,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/14752-brian-blessed-to-become-regular-fixture-in-all-maternity-wards.html,2015,"“And another one!” Brian Blessed roars as the seventh baby is delivered popping out of its mother.
There are smiles all around as he expertly bites into the umbilical cord and spits it into a bin in the corner of the room whooping with joy.
Brian Blessed is now a regular in maternity wards across England, Scotland and Wales and his roaring voice can be heard welcoming babies into the world from Land’s End to John O’Groats.
“I won’t have a baby if Brian’s not there to do the honours, he’s a blessing,” Nina Carmichael, 26, from Llandudno told her local newspaper."
Processed Meat Report Can Give You Cancer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/15490-processed-meat-report-can-give-you-cancer.html,2015,"“If you read this report whilst eating a bacon sarnie with oodles of brown sauce dripping down your chin, there’s an even bigger chance you will get cancer,” Dr. Rhanjita Singh who wrote the report revealed.
So, what sort of cancer will you get if you read the report or you eat processed meat?
“Probably cancer of the arse hole. That’s where the processed meat goes and stays, or you could get cancer of the eyeballs, I know it sounds rather gruesome but I’m just reporting from the report I wrote whilst wearing special glasses. It doesn’t matter anyway because everything these days gives you cancer,” Dr. Singh added."

In Britain today there are over  9,000 homeless veterans  and there is hope yet for them.
The government is going to put them up in nice hotels and give them £150 taxi rides.
Not only that, they will all get a nice cup of piping hot tea and some scones for as long as they want, the government has announced."
Experts: Why Climate Change/Overpopulation Cannot Be Solved With China and India Growth,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/13211-experts-why-climate-changeoverpopulation-cannot-be-solved-with-china-and-india-growth.html,2015,"As long as China and India continue to expand their population there is little or no chance of any form of respite for the earth’s climate, irrespective of any measures that may be implemented by responsible Western developed nations.
China currently has a population of 1,268,853,362 whilst India has 1,004,124,224 growing daily. These two nations are pumping out vast amounts of noxious, poisonous gases into the atmosphere, and contributing to pollution that defies measurement causing irreparable damage to the ozone and environment.
The term climate change is synonomous with over-population, they are one and the same. Overpopulation contributes to increases in carbon gases, pollution and destruction of the environment and finite resources.
Malthusian Nightmare
How do we tackle the problem of overpopulation?
The respective governments involved must increase the methods and technique of population control by speeding up sterilisation, abortion, euthanasia, contraception. Compulsory sterilisation is also an option if populations are not decreased sufficiently, and there are programs in India already enforcing this technique.
Every person in China and India wants a top-of-the-range SUV to drive. They want what they see in wealthy nations. They want to live the Western idealistic lifestyle.
The proliferation of war is another technique to reduce populations as well as instances of disease and viruses, whether man-made or natural. These techniques, however are intermittent and not consistent methods of population reduction.
Until the population of these polluting countries are decreased by large numbers, the planet and its resources are in danger, as is the rest of the responsible population of other nations.
For the planet to survive, these offending nations must implement an immediate ban on breeding, as strong as this may sound, if this is not implemented immediately, the rest of the earth’s environment has little or no chance of survival as pollution spreads through the atmosphere.
Chinese and Indian pollution encompasses the entire globe and is a direct threat to the environment and all life on planet earth."
Corbyn Regurgitates Mush During Labour Conference,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/14215-corbyn-regurgitates-mush-during-labour-conference.html,2015,"Comrade Corbyn was speaking about the delightful food at the conference and how the menu is modelled on his five-year plan for the populace when he comes to power. Pity the mush did not quite agree with the comrades palate.
“Comrades, I had the most delightful mush for lunch, and as your leader I eat the same food as you will be eating for the rest of your sorry miserable lives once I become Soviet Britain’s comrade in chief.”
During the speech, the Labour leader was seen convulsing and holding his stomach when steaming hot bubbling mush erupted from his gullet splattering the podium spectacularly.
A smiling commissar immediately rushed to the ailing leader and wiped the foul smelling gunk from his red face.
Bon appetit."
The Dangers of Not Wearing a Seatbelt,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/14021-the-dangers-of-not-wearing-a-seatbelt.html,2015,"Wearing a seatbelt can prevent you being thrown through the vehicle’s wind shield and making a mighty mess all over the windshield or road. If you know this and are still not wearing a seatbelt you’re a bit reckless aren’t you? Think about it, Bang, Crunch, Squash! Not too good eh. Seatbelts should be worn by all passengers, don’t for one second think you are safe at the back of the vehicle either.
The Human Collision
Imagine running as fast as you can – into a wall. It’s all physics innit, when a car stops abruptly, the passengers inside are still moving and unless they’re strapped in then they go for a long very fast ride against hard objects. It’s common sense so use a seatbelt.
A properly worn safety belt keeps that second collision – the human collision – from happening.
Wear It Right
“Properly worn” means with both straps snugly fitted to transfer the impact of the collision to the parts of your body that can take it – your hipbones and shoulder bones protecting your chest.
What’s Your Reason For Not Wearing One?
“I don’t need a belt – I’ve got air bags.” Lucky you! An air bag or two increases the effectiveness of a safety belt by 40 percent. But air bags were never meant to be used in place of safety belts, since they don’t protect against side impacts.
“It’s just a short journey to my local pub to get blootered then drive back!” Yes, but did you know that 80% of accidents occur within a short distance from your home?
“I don’t need a seatbelt because I’m invincible when on cocaine and I’m a good driver as well.” Sure you are. Will you be saying that when they’re pulling the steering wheel from your chest cavity?
“I’m like the Stig from Top Gear.” The Stig wears a seatbelt and has a roll cage and a helmet, you don’t.
“I’m like Richard Hammond.” You definitely will need a seatbelt then."
Have You Got Drug-Resistant Super Gonorrhoea?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/14058-have-you-got-drug-resistant-super-gonorrhoea.html,2015,"Aye, it’s not only cold, wet and miserable up North, but now there’s an extra little surprise to be found when you take a piss and green slime pops out of your lower urine delivery unit, oozing and spitting like an angry dragon with indigestion on steroids.
Friday night down in Newcastle, the scantily clad munters are out on force, and the blokes are raring to go in their white t-shirts and wild-eyed boozed up stares. The town centre’s bustling under the weight of religious lager fuelled sex, violence and drugs, and to add to the mix, a deadly strain of super gonorrhoea.
You may think it’s just another Friday night, but in the morning you wake up next to an old boiler, vomit into a half eaten doner kebab and make the long journey towards the toilet. This time, something’s wrong and you feel it in your nether regions, yes a burning sensation that you’ve never felt before except that one time you accidentally mixed up the vapo rub instead of the nivea and had a jostle before realising it was too late. Your meat pump seems like it’s on fire, you shout out in agony which invariably wakes up the girl who just gave you super gonorrhoea. Then, to top it off, instead of pee pee coming from your shogun’s eye, an eruption of different sorts shoots all over the toilet seat cover, it’s green slime, looking and smelling like something dredged up from the inside of a Chinese takeaway restaurant’s fridge.
“Something wrong luv?”
“Yeah, you gave me drug resistant super gonorrhoea. Thank you!”"
Why 2013 Was Great Year For the Spread of Syphilis and Super Gonorrhoea,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54735-why-2013-was-great-year-for-the-spread-of-syphilis-and-super-gonorrhoea.html,2024,"In the year 2000, according to CDC records and a  recent study , syphilis was on the way out and nearly eradicated, then along came the dating apps like Tinder and gay app Grindr in 2012. Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV were suddenly back in vogue and began to rise again thanks to the dating apps capitalising on the ease of casual hook-ups and 2013 was a bumper year for a massive increase in STI spreading far and wide.
Today in 2022, syphilis is at the same level as it was in the 1950s thanks to the success of  casual dating apps .
With an added drop in condom use especially with promiscuous gay men, HIV and AIDS are also increasing at an exponential level, but modern drugs halt certain death amongst this group of society.
Syphilis if not treated can cause multiple health problems and can lead to death.
All of this data points towards a fundamentally sick, masochistic society that even creates apps to increase its own level of sickness. The only positive is that nature finds a way to reduce the population level in a natural controlled manner and utilises human stupidity and greed to its advantage.
Overpopulation is a very serious problem, and thankfully, dating apps created by greedy exploitative developers are a wonderful cure to the Malthusian Nightmare scenario plaguing the globe currently."
Killing You Softly With Light,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/28363-killing-softly-light.html,2018,"It’s not only the supermarket food wrapped in plastics that kill you, or the so-called safe bottled water you drink, but now we can add the  LED streetlights  to the mix.
What better way to reduce the  population  through such an innocent medium — light.
Modern street lamps are triggering thousands of cancer cases, according to new research from the University of Exeter by Dr Alejandro Sánchez de Miguel.
A study found men living in large cities are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer while women are one and a half times more prone to breast cancer.
Scientists blame the worrying trend on the ‘blue light’ emitted by LEDs. This reduces levels of melatonin which controls the body clock.

Add into the mix the damage to human cells that  radiofrequency energy  does every time you use your mobile phone or are near a mast; and the Bisphenol A you ingest from all supermarket products, and the multiple types of engineered chemicals you take in from processed foods, the chemtrails, as well as the micro-carbons you breathe in from traffic fumes, naturally, the human body reacts to this — it creates changes in your body — tumours, anomalies, grotesque mutations. In short — Cancer.
Who is doing this? …and why?
And from this we have created an illusion, so large, so vast it will escape their perception.
Those who will see it will be thought of as insane. We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.
We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secrets of the absolute.
We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, ageing accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.
The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.
The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far. We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. With sugar they shall be sweetened on their way to early extinction.
They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them it is for their help. We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things.
When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before us by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison.
We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say. If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. Virtual reality, apps, mobile phones, websites, streaming media, social networks, games, eventually leading them to be microchipped in their brains which they will accept wholeheartedly without question.
We will use fear as our weapon. We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labour for us and we shall prosper from their toil.
Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suits us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.
We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suits us best. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers.
They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbours for as long as we see fit.
We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though images and sounds. We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this. The tools will be provided by their labour. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbours.
We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that colour is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.
When they shall band together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favour. When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.
The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.
When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial."
Will 2018 Be the Year You Stick to Your Healthy Resolution?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/26980-will-2018-year-stick-healthy-resolution.html,2017,"And as you overindulge over the holidays this time out, you’re probably telling yourself that as soon as January hits you’ll get healthy. We’ve all been there.
Those grand plans of exercising every day and eating healthy food tend to start off so well. Some people even contemplate attempting “Dry January.”
But by the time February hits, the takeaway menus are back out and the gym membership has been swept under a carpet somewhere.
So how can you make a real go of the fitness and dieting in 2018? Check out this guide for some easy tips.
Start Getting Creative in the Kitchen
Healthy eating and enjoyable eating aren’t often thought about in the same sentence.
Or at least that’s the case for people who haven’t managed to step onto and keep hold of the fitness ladder for more than a few months.
Those who do live a healthy lifestyle and eat the right foods day in, day out, will tell you that  these dishes have become their comfort foods  and they get real pleasure from eating them.
In 2018, there’s no need to say goodbye to the comfort foods that you loved in 2017. According to Deliveroo’s list of popular foods for the soul, American classics like burgers and fries are the most comforting.
These aren’t ideal for your new regime, but there are ways of still enjoying them by using fresh and lean ingredients. You could easily make these foods at home.
For the burgers, grind up some meat with a minimal fat content and season it to your liking before shaping it into patties and grilling it.
Top with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and goats’ cheese for a healthy burger. When making the fries, chop up some sweet potatoes and cook them in olive oil.
There you have it; some junk food classics revamped for your new way of life.
Get Some Fitness Equipment at Home
Many people fork out on gym memberships in January  and, when the motivation diminishes a few months later, they fail to get their money’s worth.
For some, just biting the bullet and going to the gym on a daily basis is the major stumbling block, and if they were there they would find it easy to get into the zone.
So how about bringing the gym to you? The price that some fitness centres charge these days is a small fortune, so using that money to buy fitness equipment for your own home could be a logical alternative.
Seeing the treadmill or rowing machine will remind you to work out, and you could even do it while watching your favourite shows on TV.
Another added bonus is the fact that you won’t have to share the space with all the self-obsessed selfie-takers usually found in gyms.
Getting into shape this New Year will take some motivation, but if you get into good habits at home then it will be easier to maintain.
And also, if you fork out money on gym equipment you don’t want it to end up gathering dust."
Dying in a Corridor – NHS Today and Then,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/27037-dying-in-a-corridor-nhs-today-and-then.html,2018,"The NHS was once only available to British citizens, however today it is the world’s health service.
With an ageing population, massive unfettered migration, and NHS tourists from all over the world, what hope is there for a health service that despite billions plowed into the bottomless black hole of annual funding, is dying a horrible death?
To die in a corridor is the best most people can get these days, where the neglected thirsty patient checks out of this world, not with care but with the sacrifice of care.
Hospital operations cancelled, as the  Nigerians  fly into Heathrow to deliver quintuplets for free, then fly back to Lagos never to be heard of ever again. Of course, the taxpayer foots the bill for each episode of  NHS tourism .
The opening of the gates for every  Romanian and Bulgarian  to come over to Britain and use up the NHS for free was another watershed moment in NHS history. Literally overnight, wards were full to brimming with gypsies, and EU’s poorest people demanding treatment. No wonder your neglected grandfather, who fought in the war is left to fend for himself in an NHS corridor as he calls for a nurse but is ignored.
The irony is that Britain’s socialists introduced the NHS into being, yet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch it was destroyed by the introduction of mass unfettered migration from Europe and the Third World, policies that Labour enacted.
By the intense population growth brought on by Labour, there is no room at your GP’s surgery, no room left in A&E, and no room for urgent medical attention at your local hospital. That’s because although there has been a large population increase caused by Labour, there has not been the funding, infrastructure change to compensate for the massive speedy increase.
Britain must have immigration, but it must be controlled. This is where the socialists have erred, and this is why they have ruined their own creation — the NHS.
Healthy, sustainable immigration, where the incoming population is vetted by profession, and integration value is the key to success, unfortunately, Britain has the opposite where most migrants from the poorest parts of Eastern Europe are unskilled, do not work and are a burden on Britain’s benefits system.
As your relatives lie dying and uncared for on some trolley in a hospital corridor, think on this, somewhere else in the same hospital, a possible NHS tourist or other migratory statistic is taking up their bed and care.
The NHS: created by Labour, and unceremoniously killed off by Labour."
Boat Full of Refugee American Doctors Rescued Off Coast of Guatemala,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4378-boat-full-of-refugee-american-doctors-rescued-off-coast-of-guatemala.html,2013,"Local news crews interviewed the doctors after their arduous journey.
“We set sail from San Diego two weeks ago. We had some basic rations with us, but we had to get away from the Obamacare. If I have to treat that many people in one day for peanut pay I would go insane in two days. It ain’t right, I didn’t go to Med. school all those years to be a low pay dog’s body. A group of us got this little rust bucket and jumped in it to escape America,” Dr. Barry Soto, recalled.
According to the surviving refugee doctors some of their colleagues did not make it during the harrowing journey and had to be thrown overboard for the sharks.
“It was either the sharks back home or in the sea. They chose the sea, bless their souls,” a brain surgeon from Los Angeles told rescuers.
Captain Fernando Guatirez, for the Guatemalan Lifeboat Service told reporters about the rescue: “We rescued the gringos they were floating in the sea in a boat that even our refugees would not venture on. Those crazy gringos were fleeing America. I had to pinch myself to believe it.”"

I didn’t even need to ask her to stick her tongue out. I wish all patients were like her,” Dr. Donald Epstein of the Beverly Hills Health Center told the LA Sun newspaper.
According to reports, the pop starlet has a few nasty things growing on her tongue, possibly due to over exposure.
Health expert, Gerardo Hernendez said: “If you’re going to expose your tongue all day in the public, the surface will attract all kinds of bacteria, and fungus. From initial tests, Ms. Cyrus has 12 different types of fungi growing on her tongue, some of which could be toxic. Heck, we’ll probably see mushrooms growing on that thing soon, or maybe slimy mold.”"

“My new dental practice will be unique, because I will forbid the use of any form of anaesthetic whilst I am digging through your gums with a rusty drill bit,” the former PM told a local newspaper.
Mr Brown is eager to make every patient feel like they are in a cabinet meeting or stuck in the ex-PM’s private office during his tenure as prime monster.
“We’re already booked up. Some people are even crossing the border to get treatment from Brown. Our best client so far is some chap called Tony. He’s got a dazzling smile, or should I say, he used to have a dazzling smile, until the dentist got to work on him with those pliers,” Mr Brown’s receptionist said from the surgery.
Luckily for the residents on each side of Mr Brown’s dental surgery, the soundproofed walls will drown out the screams and tortuous wailing of his patients."

The Internal Organ Removal Diet that Can Help You Stay Slim Forever,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2088-the-internal-organ-removal-diet-that-can-help-you-stay-slim-forever.html,2010,"If you answered ‘yes’ to any of the above, and you’re dreading starting another well-intentioned New Year weight loss programme that you know is doomed to failure almost before it’s started – don’t despair.
The good news is that medical research now appears to confirm that your weight gain may not be your fault at all, but a problem with you having internal organs. Even better, there is a new way – finally – to do something about those unwanted organs that once removed will lower your overall weight.
Respected U.S. nutritionist Hannah McTavish, spoke of the new program on the Oprah Winfrey show: “It’s real simple. You eat a lot of junk, you get fat. You’re lazy and sit in front of the computer all day surfing and eating. Well, with this diet you can carry on doing the same old things and still look like a million dollars. No exercise, no dieting, just straight weight loss.”
The simple operation that guarantees weight loss was first pioneered in China, where internal organs are taken out of recently executed mentally ill patients and sold to rich Americans. One of the doctors on the program noticed the dramatic weight loss on his subjects after removing their internal organs and sold the idea to the West.
“The doctors determine how much weight you need to lose, then they take out half of your internal organs so that you can still walk around and live. There’s no point in taking both of your lungs out because then you wouldn’t be able to breathe, so instead they take out one of your kidneys, maybe your spleen and a few yards of your intestinal tract. Weight loss is then dramatic and instantaneous,” Ms McTavish added.
The beauty of this slimming program is that many shortages in transplants can be solved purely because of the volume of people rushing to get slim again.
“I had the procedure done last week. They took out my left lung, a kidney, half of my liver and part of my rectum. I slimmed down quick enough to look fabulous just before my entrance into the Celebrity Big Brother house,” a barely alive minor celebrity told the Sun newspaper."

Deadly Findings
“These new findings are incredible news. After many years of research, and many birthdays I might add, we have found that having a lot of birthdays can kill you. Indeed, over half of the researchers who were working on the project are now dead, as well as thousands of study subjects,” Dr. Bill Underground, 94, told Science Weekly.
Sadly last week, Dr. Underground passed away and the research project on birthdays was passed on to his colleague, Jimmy Kimble, 91, for the remainder of the assignment."

“Free Burritos for everyone is our next Dem deal. Not one person shall go hungry in America. You want a steak? You got one. You want a cheesecake? You got two. This is going to revolutionise food in America forever,” Barack Obama told Congress yesterday.
The cost of Obama’s upcoming  Free Food For All  bill is estimated to be about 134 trillion dollars per annum and these are of course conservative estimates.
Fat people across America, (98% of the population), rejoiced with joy in restaurants and supermarkets across the country after the announcement was made.
Sharonda Latrina, a 322 lbs. Obama supporter from Chicago said this about the new Obama Free Food bill: “Hawt diggedy dayum, I just told my whole neighborhood about this new Free Food bill. We just went got twenty buckets of fried chicken.  Free food for life and free health care for life? I love Obama, he be the bomb.”

By that time, either Sarah Palin will be waving her gun around the White House or General Petraeus will have nuked half the Middle East. Besides,  Obamacare  practitioners are now saying that health care will not be free, it will have many, many strings attached to it.
Call centres across America have been inundated with people begging for ‘free health care’ after the landmark health care ruling a few weeks ago.
“Every few seconds  we get thousands of calls through our switchboard asking for free health care. Some of the calls are from as far as Guatemala and Mexico, they keep saying they want to come over for that free health care,” Anna Ross, a Medicare   worker told CBS.
The already bankrupted US economy is under great strain and now that half of South America has the idea in their heads that the US has got free health care, there is no stopping the deluge.
“We have enough poverty in the United States, where over half the population is below the poverty line and need urgent assistance, now we have the additional problem of 90% of Mexico wanting to cross our borders for free health care when there is none for our citizens. I just tell them to wait until 2015. That’s when you hear the shouting and cussing down the line,” Mrs Ross added."

Some UK Health Services are advising their clients to die earlier and spare themselves the pain of living in a country which is now a broken shell deep in recession and with no hope of ever recovering.
“I was told by my Health Officer that I had thirty more years to live. It upset me a great deal and the thought of living for more than a few years in this country is driving me crazy,” Reg McFarlin, from Hammersmith told ITN’s London Tonight program.
Millions of people in the UK are now living in a form of purgatory, stuck in misery and waiting eagerly for their moment to come sooner and not later.

New Study Reveals Junk Food Good for You,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1255-new-study-reveals-junk-food-good-for-you.html,2008,"Eating is a natural part of life. But according to some researchers, some types of food eaten – namely sugary and fatty foods – are better for you than so-called healthy foods.
The idea that junk food is unhealthy has been claimed in a number of newspapers with headlines such as: “Fast food can be as bad as heroin and cocaine, claims new research”, “Burgers are like smoking crack”, “Sugar and fat ‘as addictive as meth’ researchers say”, and “Junk food is bad bad bad”.
These scare-mongering headlines appear to have been triggered by a media blitz on our beloved junk food industry looking for sensational fear-inducing news soundbites to chew on. Johnson Banzhaffer, professor of law at George Washington University, details why the public should be weary of such media hype. He puts forward his argument that there is mounting evidence that fast food is actually good for you. He points to various pieces of research that originally appeared in an article in the New Scientist magazine in February 2003.
“There is mounting evidence from the scientific and academic community that eating large doses of junk food is the key to a long and healthy life.”
A number of studies have been carried out in rats to look at processed foods and their benefits. Dr. Anne Selley, professor of neuroscience at Tacoma Community College together with Juillaro Wilson, has been studying rats and diet for a number of years. One study found that a high-fat diet appears to alter the brain biochemistry to radically increase intelligence levels. They say this is due to the increased levels of various monoamines — namely dopamine in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, noradrenalin in the hypothalamus and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and serotonin in the amygdala and frontal cortex.
While the co-administration of a dopamine antagonist is known to decrease the stimulant effect of amphetamine, it does not negate the wakefulness-promoting actions of eating vast amounts of junk food.
Eating junk food also activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABAergic neurotransmission.
According to Dr. Anne Selley, rats “love the high-fat food and they eat and eat. We found there are actually huge intelligence strides that are elicited by exposure to a chronic high-fat diet.” She believes that it is possible to compare the findings about rats to humans, making it very plausible that humans can benefit from high-sugar and fatty foods also.
“Those particular types of food – the fat and the sugar – are really the key to all longevity and intelligence,” she said. “They’re responsible for the behavioural changes that manifest, and also the brain changes that look like genius levels of intelligence. When I eat a cheeseburger and fries I immediately feel the synapses sparking up and 
my cognition enhanced to a very high level.
Bartholemew D. Scheisse, a neuroscientist from Princeton University, led a similar study into sugar benefits which was published in the journal Neuroscience Research in June 2002. Again, rats were used and were gradually fed a diet with increasing amounts of sugar. The more sugar given the quicker the rats solved major puzzles, and when it was suddenly withdrawn from their food they experienced “dumbing down” reactions such as bumping into walls, looking bored and staring vacantly into space.
According to Scheisse, sugar triggers the production of the brain’s natural monoamines. “We think that is a key to the increased intelligence process,” he said. “The brain is sparking up synapses and making new neural connections every time you indulge in fatty sugary processed junk foods.”
“The implication,” he added, “is that animals and people can increase their life expectancy and intelligence levels on sweet food, particularly if they periodically binge on large amounts of the stuff. Eating pizza, burgers, twinkies, Doritos, Taco Bell and a greasy chop at Black Angus will make you into a walking genius rivalling brain boxes like Einstein and Stephen Hawking.”
More studies in rats by Dr. Munter Leibowitz, a neurobiologist at Tucson University, showed that exposure to fatty foods might reconfigure the neural system to want more knowledge. Her studies have shown that rats fed on a high-fat diet become more insistent on solving complicated puzzles which included complicated mathematical algorithms. Eating high fat processed junk food is the key to healthy living.
Junk Food
Here are some tips to enjoy eating junk food so that its benefits can be fully realised.
1) Drink two litres of a high sugar soda drink before eating junk food. This will keep your brain dosed up with sugar and ready to receive even more sugar.
2) Do not order an iced tea or fresh fruit juice. Instead, order colas or aerated drinks.
3) Avoid fresh fruit, vegetables, rice or fish like the plague. Ask for extra servings of fried foods and high fat sugary processed foods instead.
4) When eating junk food like burgers and pizza, be sure to add extra mayonnaise, ketchup or anything else you can find with high fat levels.
5) Do not chew your food – just suck it down. Rushing is good. This will help you to eat more junk food in one session.
6) While dessert is usually eaten after a meal, why not enjoy your dessert before AND after the main junk food meal? Try to indulge on monstrous sundaes, brownies, gooey fudge and large dollops of processed cream as often as you can.
7) Junk food contains a lot of fat and sodium. To increase your intake, it is best to drink a lot of colas and sugary soda.
Hope these seven pointers help the next time you feel like indulging in more healthy junk food.
A C T I O N    P O I N T S
If you think you might be avoiding eating large amounts of sugar or fat, try increasing portion sizes gradually.
Try to eat a healthy fat and sugar-balanced diet as often as you can.
If you feel you could have a problem with not eating enough junk food, seek the help of a qualified junk food manufacturer or speak to your local fast food restaurant."
Mothers Warned as Number of Brain-Damaged (FAS) Babies Doubles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1132-mothers-warned-as-number-of-brain-damaged-fas-babies-doubles.html,2007,"Experts last night called for a campaign to curb alcohol abuse by pregnant women after figures showed the number of babies left brain damaged each year in Britain has doubled in a decade.
Official statistics show there were 1 million babies registered with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) in Britain in 2004 bringing to 16 million the number born with the neurological brain disorder in a decade.
However, campaigners warned the damage done to babies from alcohol abuse is far greater than official statistics show, claiming heavy drinking among pregnant women is also linked to learning difficulties, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder. The number of alcohol-related deaths is rising faster in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.
Statistics from the General Register Office for the United Kingdom show drink was responsible for the deaths of 65,000 women last year, double the number who died 20 years earlier, while it is estimated that three in four women binge drink and more than a third exceed the weekly alcohol limit of 14 units.
Jenna Jameson, executive director of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome in the UK, the public awareness and support charity, said government should insist the drinks industry provide health warnings on bottles and cans similar to that in the US. The messages state that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.
“We have found higher figures for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome than has been revealed. We are now at epidemic level here in the UK and the problem is increasing daily,” she said.
“You hear of children in nursery schools having more hyperactivity, more attention deficit disorder and more speech problems and it is the result of their mothers binge drinking three or four years ago.”
Mrs Jameson said labelling would go some way to changing people’s habits. “We currently have cans and bottles which have warning labels when they are shipped to the US, but there is a blank space when the same cans and bottles are sold in the UK. You could say they are withholding information from women.”
Phil Lynollot, professor in public health at Birmingham University, said there needed to be a concerted campaign, but doubted there was a public desire to change habits.
“Levels of alcohol-related harm for all adults is undoubtedly going up in all social groups,” he said. “It is socially patterned. Those in the poorer parts of the UK are experiencing a worse manifestation of the problem than those in more affluent areas. The idea children are being damaged to a greater extent than in the past seems highly likely.”
The professor added, “There have been some high profile cases which have brought forth the immense problem. Jade Goody, the Big Brother contestant, is an example of this. She has shown the problems of brain-damage through excessive drinking and drug-taking by her mother. It is a good thing that her plight is brought forward into the discussion forum and not brushed under the proverbial carpet.”
Indeed, high profile cases like Jade Goody have introduced the problem of Foetal-Alcohol-Syndrome to the general public but there is still a vast wall of ignorance to be dealt with. Not only from the Goody family but from the general public.
Jade Goody’s mother, Jackie Budden, is an example of how some British women have embraced alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and Jade’s success as a celebrity in the F-list category is also proof that severely mentally incompetent people like Jade Goody can succeed even though they are undeveloped and subnormal with extremely low IQ’s."
Exposed: The Food From ‘Fat Duck’ Restaurant That Poisoned Thousands,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1704-exposed-the-food-from-fat-duck-restaurant-that-poisoned-thousands.html,2009,"Bloated celebrity chef, Heston Blumenthal, who has gorged at the trough of many free lunches, is used to getting the tax-payer to foot the bill of his BBC cookery shows advertising his restaurant. Tonight he is rubbing his fat bald head in disgrace.
The Daily Squib can reveal for the first time the food that has poisoned thousands.
Some patrons who visited the Fat Duck are now calling for the ‘Fat F * ck’ Blumenthal to be strung up by his bollocks from a very high tree.
“I paid £350 for a plate of his food. Well I’ve been on the shitter for the best half of a week and my projectile vomiting antics resemble something from Linda Blair’s repertoire. I want a refund!” a furious customer said.
Diners at the Fat Duck – one of only three restaurants in the UK with three Michelin stars – can experience dishes such as deep fried mars bars, snail porridge or snot scrambled eggs and a bacon sarnie ice cream. The most popular dish according to health investigators is egg and chips with a fat greasy gammon steak thrown onto it from a great height and finished off with a dollop of mushy peas marinated in rancid Special Brew.
“This is British gourmet food that we can be proud of. I refute any claims that anyone has been taken ill by our food. It is the best food in Europe at the moment and I would even go as far as saying it is the best in the world,” Mr Blumenthal told the News of the World newspaper."
Faulty French Implant Causing Distress,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3123-faulty-french-implant-causing-distress.html,2012,"“He is not only a danger to France — but himself. He looks a bit  like  a tit, acts like one, and is toxic to the world of politics. I say we  take this faulty impudent little implant out and dump it in the nearest sewer, where it belongs,” Jean Beano, a respected French politician told Le Monde  newspaper.
Monsieur  Leblanc, president of the French Association of Implants, Tits and  Politicians, told BBC Radio 4’s The World At Two: “Even with a very low  popularity rating, he is an implant that would have to definitely be  removed.
“If you believe a device is faulty, I think this would  be true in your car or any other object that you buy, you would want to  have that replaced immediately as well.
“Certainly, Sarkozy, is at a  very much higher toxicity rate than we would consider acceptable.  Good implants put in by reputable nations really have an extraordinarily  low failure rate so this is quite out of the ordinary. In other words,  we need to get rid of this fucker tout suite, if you know what I mean,  Harry.”
The question is, which surgeon will step up to the plate to remove this faulty implant?"
Psychologists: Why Having a Good Grope at the Office is Good For You,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3263-psychologists-why-having-a-good-grope-at-the-office-is-good-for-you.html,2012,"It’s OK to grope in the office. Squeezing a buttock or a nice pert breast can do wonders for one’s moral, especially if you’re having an awfully stressful day at the office.
The study funded by the Treasury in the UK and US Dept. of Commerce in America is a concerted effort to increase productivity and boost the economy of the US and UK, who have been blighted by recession and poor job employment numbers.
It used to be just a male preserve in the 50s, 60s and 70s, but office groping is now a female pastime too. Grabbing a man’s tackle can improve work productivity by up to 80% experts say.
“Stress is a killer when it comes to office productivity. Companies are losing billions every year to workers being too stressed and beaten down. Our studies were conducted over three decades and prove emphatically that groping in the work place is the equivelant of high octane adrenaline being pumped into the veins of workers. They suddenly perk up, in more ways than one, and their work improves. As for the person who is groped, it’s all a bit of fun, they either grope back or enjoy the moment, this improves their self-esteem and self-worth as well as their standing within the office hierarchy,” Dr Ronald Eamons, told the BBC.
Case study Julia Harting who works at Investment banking firm, Redditch Mathers, in the City, told of her stress busting grope sessions.
“It was Monday morning, I really did not want to be back at work. Then the boss called me in and told me that the projected sales targets for this quarter were woefully short and if I did not get myself into gear I would probably have to be let go. Naturally, I was stressed so as I walked out of the boardroom I saw a male colleague and I groped his tackle. To say he was pleased is an understatement. It made his day, and it bloody well cheered me up. I went back to my desk and got 12 sales that morning.”
Thousands of companies are now implementing these stress busting techniques into their offices worldwide and there seems to be a groping revolution happening right now."
New STD Dating App Hinder – Swipe Right For Guaranteed Infection,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/15726-new-std-dating-app-hinder-swipe-right-for-guaranteed-infection.html,2015,"Developed by Harvard graduate, Gono Rea, 26, the app has already achieved 450 million downloads after its introduction last week.
“This app is a lot like Tinder, but where  Tinder  is about spreading infectious diseases anonymously, Hinder spreads diseases knowingly. Hinder users may already have three or five diseases but maybe they want to catch another one, or spread to someone who doesn’t have a disease that you have. Choose your poison: Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, genital Herpes, genital warts, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, HIV, crabs, Trichomonas, Chancroid, Mycoplasma genitalium.”
Sexually transmitted diseases are spread through all bodily fluids and in some instances skin to skin contact, and this is why hook-up apps are spreading these diseases like wildfire throughout the global mainly Western population. Oral sex is also a great transmission tool as well as unprotected sex and even kissing where bodily fluids are transferred to each recipient spreading many diseases fast through the app using population.
“The big one is AIDS, and the gay app Grindr is doing a great job in spreading HIV to as many gay men as possible. Gays are very promiscuous and AIDS is sky rocketing amongst their numbers. Hetero app Tinder is coming along nicely too and HIV amongst users is increasing at an exponential rate, eventually killing all these people off. We estimate HIV will be spread to all app users by 2020, and retro-viral treatment is increasing in cost daily making it harder for users to control the onset of full-blown AIDS. Let’s just say it is a great way to reduce populations, thinning out the herd,” an officer for the Ministry of Population Control in London told the BBC.
AIDS has taken a back foot since the mid-eighties when it had its heyday but now thanks to these hook-up apps is enjoying a massive resurgence.
Tinder user Amy Daniels, 21, from California is very pretty, attracting vast amounts of attention on the site.
“I get like eight or nine hook-ups a day because I’m hot looking. Yes, I had myself tested but I was disappointed to only have four diseases, one of which is AIDS. I don’t take drugs to help it because my Obamacare does not pay. To tell you the truth, I don’t care as long as I’m having a good time, and the guys don’t seem to care either. We’re just fucking and fucking. It’s great. Now I gotta try Hinder, looks like I’m qualified.”
With antibiotics becoming increasingly useless to treat bacterial infections and viral strains mutating all the time, the medical fraternity can only sit and watch as the infections increase thanks to the apps fuelling the spread of sexually transmitted diseases amongst all hook-up dating app users."
No Wonder Americans Are All on Prescription Drugs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/16233-no-wonder-americans-are-all-on-prescription-drugs.html,2015,"Living in American society is a competitive hell march where millions fall by the side every day.
Opting out of the horrendous grinding schedule that makes up their hollow shallow existence is nigh on impossible unless you are drugged up to the eyeballs.
“If you don’t take prescription drugs in America, you ain’t in society.
“How else can these people in shops smile sweetly and wish you a good day? It’s because they’re pilled up to the eye balls with anti-depressants and what not.
“Take the pills away and most Americans would be in a corner somewhere cradling a Glock in their shaking hands and frothing at the mouth,” Dr. Julius Fintner, a psychoanalyst at the Fitz Institute of Epilepsy told CNN.
Living on the edge, millions of American citizens barely make their car payments let alone their health costs.
If you get sick in America, that’s it, Obamacare won’t pay for most illnesses and the premiums are so high that the health insurance is nigh on useless. The pressure of work and kids, keeping up with the Joneses and the constant levels of competition are immense.
The sad part is, most Americans are so insular that they can’t see what they’re doing to themselves.
It’s only people from outside the goldfish bowl who can see the tortuous lives of these very sick people living their lives in a hell soup of mental illness and drug induced lunacy.
When America implodes, there will be fireworks seen from space. The deficit is so large right now that even the IMF is welcoming in the Yuan as a reserve currency. The countdown to the purge has already begun.."
Purge: HIV Adapting to Antiretroviral Drugs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/17068-purge-hiv-adapting-to-antiretroviral-drugs.html,2016,"Maybe the likes of Charlie Sheen won’t have their reprieve after all.
Strains of HIV are becoming  resistant  to an antiretroviral drug commonly used to prevent and fight the virus, research has suggested.
With many across the globe forgetting about HIV especially with the thought they are safe because of antiretroviral drugs, there may be cause for concern by some at least.
HIV adapts to any situation, and the false sense of safety enabled by drug companies may soon be over.
“What we will see here is a massive increase in AIDS, because the drugs stopping HIV developing into AIDS are now mostly compromised by the adaptation of this virus to many human made medicines,” an HIV expert told news media.
Along with the Zika virus, there seems to be a war on sexual reproduction on this planet, where HIV is caught by people usually during recreational sex,  Zika  is a virus that mutates offspring from pregnant women with shrunken heads and partial brain growth ensuring they live their lives without ever reproducing.
The beauty about Zika is that she is symptomless, unlike something like Ebola, Zika can spread far and wide with minimal detection.
These events, whether natural or not, only mean that something, Gaia or some organisation is fighting back against the creeping overpopulation that eventually would mean the total destruction of the earth and its finite resources."
Lord Owen: TTIP Will Kill NHS – Britain Must Brexit,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/18065-lord-owen-ttip-will-kill-nhs-britain-must-brexit.html,2016,"The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) will have negative implications towards Britain’s health service, and will eventually lead to its full privatisation unless there is a Brexit. This is why David Cameron and his cohort George Osborne are so keen for Britain’s people to vote to remain in the EU.
The majority of people who wish to remain in the EU are clueless to TTIP and how it will impact on the NHS, and the Britain Stronger in Europe team are not keen to divulge the true information regarding the TTIP treaty between the EU and US.
Speaking today, former Labour Health Minister, Lord Owen demystified the many variables and faults of TTIP with regards to the NHS, and how it is ultimately in Britain’s interests to vote to leave the EU on June 23.
We have included Lord Owen’s speech in full:
Protecting our NHS from the EU
The EU could have been the champion of the social market and by including the term in its treaty structure I hoped it would be its prime exponent worldwide. Yet in 2016, for many millions of young people, the EU is indelibly linked to unemployment and  ‘austerity’, not the social market. The fatal flaws in the design of the Eurozone have created a dysfunctional EU, united only in its incapacity to run a social market or a single currency.
Can anyone justify the appalling figures for unemployment – a direct result of the euro crisis – for the under 25s in Spain, that reached 54% and is expected to be between 18-19% in 2017 despite encouraging economic growth. In Greece, Portugal, Italy there is still savage unemployment, in Ireland many young people left to go abroad. Still the euro crisis persists; a dysfunctional EU cannot, it appears, make the structural reforms.
Can anyone justify the secret trade negotiations the Commission have signed up for in TTIP? Despite protests little has been done to redress its errors. No regard for the social purpose of healthcare and the erosion of health as a Member State responsibility. The EU/Eurozone from 1992, in marked contrast to the old European Community of 1975, creeps into every nook and cranny of our life. It is now becoming entrenched in the NHS and this June we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get it out.
The Second World War brought the Emergency Medical Service in the UK, the Beveridge report and the 1944 White Paper outlining the provisions of a UK-wide service. A cross-party resolve emerged in wartime within the British people that when peace came there would be a different and better system of healthcare for everyone. The result was the NHS of 1948. It lasted until 2002. In England it is no longer national in the sense of being comprehensive or planned.
Healthcare, in a very real sense, is infinite. The amount of money invested in the NHS is a democratic choice, relative to what we choose to spend on education, housing, welfare, defence. That rationing process within the 1948 design of the NHS was flexible, professional and democratically accountable. In England it is barely answerable to the Westminster Parliament. The Scottish Parliament, the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies still run recognizable national health services. Different designs exist in many parts of the world but no system has been judged internationally as being able to match, for overall cost effectiveness, the 1948 UK design.
In this EU referendum, as in the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the design of the marketised English NHS promises to be a source of legitimate political division.  Politics cannot be an ideology-free zone. The report released on Friday of the collapse of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough contract calls for a review of “all current and planned clinical commissioning groups and NHS England contracts of this sort as a matter of urgency, before entering into any new commitments.” That manifest failure is a dire warning about the massive extra costs of market structures and advisers.
We in the cross-party Vote Leave Campaign, however, share a common democratic commitment. We will restore legal powers and democratic control of the NHS to voters in the UK. If we vote Leave – we will be able to protect our NHS from EU interference.
We all need to respect and value, whatever political parties we support, those elements which bind the citizens of the UK together and the NHS is one of those. Now is the time to take back control from the EU and protect our NHS for future generations.
From 1973-2002 the European Commission, by and large, stayed out of interfering in the UK NHS. It was assumed that this was politically too sensitive and in those days the Commission was not obsessed with proposing market solutions to social policy. The EU social market was always open to exceptions, perhaps the most famous being the French railway system, where Paris has historically not accepted any EU intervention. Lately, however, on health it has been accepted in Brussels that for ‘consumer’ the Commission can read ‘patient’.
In 2006 the Labour government commissioned a legal opinion on the effect of EU legislation on the NHS. The Health Department’s then commercial director, Ken Anderson, who had been involved with independent surgical treatment centres (ISTCs), told the  Financial Times  in January 2007: ‘My personal conviction is that once you open up NHS services to competition, the ability to shut that down or call it back passes out of your hands. At some point European law will take over and prevail … In my opinion, we are at that stage now.’ As if recognising the truth of this interpretation on 13 December 2007, with not much publicity, the Department of Health issued a document titled  Principles and Rules for Cooperation and Competition , running through which are EU legal positions which have become the law that operates in the UK.
The advisory Co-operation and Competition Panel was reported in the  Financial Times  to have been applying its interpretation of the law since 2009 – by advising on NHS mergers and handling complaints about anti-competitive practices by hospitals and primary care trusts.  In truth, since 2002 the Labour government, the Coalition government and now the Conservative government have accepted an EU market in health.
Personally I believe a ‘progressive alliance’ government supported by Labour, SNP, Green, Plaid Cymru and Northern Irish politicians from all parts of the UK will emerge within the next decade which will challenge that market consensus. As democrats we agree they must have the democratic right to reinstate the 1948 design.
Barbara Castle predicted in the 1975 referendum, against my view as the then Minister of Health, when she was Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, that the NHS would be challenged by Brussels. She has been proven right.
The NHS Operating Framework from the Department of Health for 2011 encouraged, for the first time, price competition below a maximum tariff. David Bennett, the current chief executive of Monitor, who had been a senior partner at McKinsey and head of the Downing Street policy directorate and strategy unit under Tony Blair, gave an interview to  The Times  in February 2011 which described the regulator’s new role in promoting competition. ‘We did it in gas, we did it in power, we did it in telecoms,’ he said. ‘We’ve done it in rail, we’ve done it in water. So there is actually twenty years’ experience of taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation.’ It was, he declared, ‘too easy to say “How can you compare buying electricity with buying healthcare services?” Of course they are different. I would say … there are important similarities and that’s what convinces me that choice and competition will work in the NHS as they did in those other sectors’. This encouraged the Commission to apply competition rules.
Nigel Edwards, the acting chief executive of the NHS Confederation, underlined the degree to which under the 2012 legislation it was intended that the state would ‘be withdrawing from the day-to-day management of health care’, with the service becoming ‘like a regulated industry’ on the lines of telecommunications, water and the energy industries. It could, he warned, ‘trigger a major reshaping of the way care is delivered with services closing and changing’. ‘I do not think most people have grasped the scale of this change,’ he continued. ‘By 2014, the NHS will no longer be a system which still contains the characteristics of an organisation. Instead it will be a regulated industry in which that management chain no longer exists.’ Amid ‘any willing provider’, services would have to become more responsive to patients. But in a system with no real financial growth that would mean that new providers would have to replace existing ones. ‘There will have to be an element of Joseph Schumpeter’s “creative destruction”.’That too encouraged the Commission.
The campaigning group 38 Degrees commissioned an important legal opinion on the EU and the NHS. ‘It is likely that, even as matters stand, and in view in particular of recent non-statutory reforms which increase the involvement of the private and third sector in health services provision, competition law already applies to PCTs and NHS providers.’ They concluded that the 2012 legislation reinforced that view, adding that there was ‘nothing in the Bill which has or can have the effect of preventing the application of competition law’ since prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct ‘gives rise to actionable claims in the High Court by any person affected’.
The Dutch competition authority (the NMa) has had the effect of fragmenting service provision and impeding the provision of high-quality care.  A €7.7 million fine levied on the Dutch GP association for a ‘bad case of anti-competitive behaviour’, which was the association’s efforts to ensure that all areas of the country were adequately provided with GP services. The Dutch Patients’ and Consumers’ Federation called for the involvement of competition in healthcare to be urgently reviewed.
The EU has deliberately obfuscated TTIP. The hugely experienced Pascal Lamay has rightly criticised the design of TTIP for it is not just a trade agreement, it is also a regulatory agreement. This always was an indefensible mixing up of what are two quite different legislative matters and all done with no reference whatever to the British Parliament.
In September 2014 in order to head off the growing opposition in the SPD and German trade unions to the ISDS terms, the Economic Affairs Ministry – headed by SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel – issued a joint position paper on the TTIP along with the DGB, Germany’s trade union confederation including the country’s largest trade unions like IG Metall and Ver.di.  The paper, while praising elements of the TTIP, pledged on the ISDS: ‘Investment protection provisions are generally not required … In any case, investor–state arbitration and unclear definitions of legal terms such as “fair and just treatment” or “indirect expropriation” must be rejected.’ The German government and the European Commission are at odds over whether national parliaments will need to ratify alongside the European Parliament. The Commission said no, but Berlin argued that a ‘mixed agreement’ with some of the issues, goods and services covered falling outside of the EU’s sole jurisdiction, the Bundestag and Bundesrat  should also get to scrutinise the agreement and vote on it. The German government warned that it was willing to go all the way to the ECJ on this issue.
After having carefully considered the joint statements by the Commission and the United States government of 20 March 2015 and the defence of the present TTIP by the British government, the legal advice from Michael Bowsher QC, is very critical about its implications for the UK NHS . He advised that despite the new right to regulate it was vague and subject to inherent uncertainties as to how it would be interpreted by arbitral tribunals and that the valid exercise of a right to regulate could, nonetheless, give rise to compensation even when there was no valid claim in domestic law.
We are agreed in Vote Leave, that whatever our political views on the present marketization of the NHS, decisions on the NHS should for the future be for the UK Parliament and devolved administrations to take. It should not be for the European Commission nor the European Parliament.
Our longstanding democracy has hitherto for a century and more accepted as a principle that the people through their vote in national elections should decide the policy and direction of  health care.
If people  Vote to Leave on 23 June  – as I hope they will – it will automatically follow that no British government can ratify the present TTIP.  Thereafter, UK legislation will govern the NHS in future and as a consequence we can take back control and protect the NHS from the EU. The NHS will not have to be part of any new UK-EU free trade agreement.    There will no longer be competition and market led interference from the European Commission."
EU Confirms British Women Will Still pay Tampon Tax if Remain,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/18119-eu-confirms-british-women-will-still-pay-tampon-tax-remain.html,2016,"Responding to the publication of the European Commission’s action plan on value added tax (VAT), Anne Marie-Trevelyan MP said:
“I am appalled that the European Commission continues to treat the British people with contempt. Despite the Chancellor’s best efforts, he and the UK Government are powerless to make a minor alteration to our tax code without the EU’s permission. Now we learn that, despite a pledge to scrap the tampon tax, women will still be charged VAT on sanitary products, and any attempt by the UK Government to zero-rate them could be vetoed by any of the 27 other member states even after the referendum.
This is a minor change requested at the personal intervention of both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister and still the EU says no.  Losing control of our taxation is a failure of democracy. We need to take back control and vote to leave this failing political project.”
The Commission has announced that British women will still be paying the tampon tax after the referendum, despite Government claims to have ended the tax.
The UK will also still be obliged to increase VAT on the installation of solar panels and other energy saving products.
The Commission admits the ‘single market’ has failed businesses for decades. The EU institutions are too sclerotic to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.
The Commission admits that its proposals will result in an increase in red tape.
This proposal will not make it easier to lower VAT.
Vote Leave  on  June 23  to take back our country."
NHS to Only Treat Healthy People,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3280-nhs-to-only-treat-healthy-people.html,2012,"“If you’re not healthy, then I’m afraid we cannot treat you,” David Sanders, chief executive of the Northern England Health Trust told the BBC.
The latest NHS ruling is a positive development in cost cutting that could benefit the Health Service and bring it back from the brink of bankruptcy.
“Instead of treating people who are actually sick at great cost to the NHS, we will only treat healthy people who basically need minimal or no treatment thus saving huge amounts of money. Hospital beds could be freed up in minutes, and there would be hardly any need for such things as operating theatres,” Mr Sanders revealed.
The new NHS rules will come into effect next week across the UK."
Britons Starting to Get Gills Say Biologists,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3720-britons-starting-to-get-gills-say-biologists.html,2013,"“We’re seeing more people developing gills on the side of their necks and webbed feet,” Henry Fistleplath, a biologist who has been studying the British population’s adaptation to the wet climate, revealed to the BBC yesterday
Thousands of Britons are now sprouting gills and are more at home in a wet puddle than inside their hovels getting bladdered on cheap supermarket booze.
“I used to get my dole money on the Tuesday, then straight down Aldi for some cartons of cheap wine but now I go to the High Street and sit in one of those massive puddles and swish around there. I can’t control meself (sic),” Ian McCorrie, 27, an unemployed man from Grimsby who has amazingly sprouted some gills and webbed feet, revealed to Newsnight.
The gills allow the former humans to breathe under water but because they still have noses they can still breathe above water as well.
“If you want to swim to the shops it’s OK, then once you’re done you get out of the water and flush your gills out and you can be above dry land then,” another  gilled  Briton, Mary Ruskens, 43, told the Sun newspaper.
It has been raining constantly in the British Isles since September 2012 and there does not appear to be any sign of the rain stopping the Met office has said."
EU Referendum Video: Which NHS Will You Vote For?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/18972-eu-referendum-video-which-nhs-will-you-vote-for.html,2016,"Vote Leave has released its first referendum broadcast which focuses on the risks to the NHS of voting to stay in the EU. It shows a mother and daughter going to Accident and Emergency after the mother is taken ill.
It then shows two different realities: one if we stay in the EU and another if we Vote Leave. It shows how if we stay in the EU, the NHS will continue to be starved of cash and pressures from unlimited EU immigration will mean people will have to wait longer to be treated.
Outside the EU – after we Vote Leave and take back control – we will be able to spend billions more each year on the NHS and take back control of our borders. This will ease pressures on the NHS and will help people to get treated more quickly.
Vote Leave Chair Gisela Stuart said:
‘The NHS is struggling to cope with rising demand. The Government has simply not given it the funding that it needs.
‘Instead of handing over £350 million a week to Brussels we should spend our money on our priorities like the NHS.
‘If we Vote Leave we will be able to stop our money being spent on EU bureaucrats and instead invest in the NHS so that patients can get the best possible care.’"
Gender Fluids Afraid of Plug Holes and Drains,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/19281-gender-fluids-afraid-of-plug-holes-and-drains.html,2016,"Dr. Erasmus Kotero, has found a new phenomena across the Gender Fluid community of  young people across the state.
“They’re afraid of plug holes and drains. A lot of them cannot bathe because they feel they may be sucked down into the drainage system when their Gender Fluids activate. We had one patient who identifies as a male on Tuesdays but on Wednesday likes to identify as non cis gender stat acronymus portens. The fear of being sucked down drains increases as they activate their Super Gender Status after reading more literature made up from psychiatrists. Plug holes have to be covered up and disguised, such is the fear level. Patient Z, a student at UCLA had to be rescued from a shower room last week when they started to block the drains with furniture causing major blockages in the sewer system. This action alone cost the state $3.8 million to rectify. So, you can see it is a costly affair.”
Stinky
Subject X, a hysterical student at San Francisco university commented: “It goes down! The water goes down the plug hole into the drain. Eaaargh! It goes down drop by drop sucking up my gender fluids. Argh! Argh! Eaaargh! No shower. No washy! No showers or bath! Sucked down into the drain!”"
Milo Yianapapapadopulos Prolapse Shame Live On Talkshow,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/20745-milo-yanapapapadopulos-prolapse-shame-live-talkshow.html,2016,"WARNING: Some of the medical descriptions could be upsetting to some readers.
Milo Yianapopoolus has come under increasing scrutiny from the medical profession after having a prolonged anal prolapse during another one of his narcissistic talk shows where he talked about himself at great length amongst goggle-eyed Americans.
Celebrated by dumb Americans
The celebrated ‘right-winger’ styles himself on conservative values yet exhibits completely non-conservative practices in real life.
Speaking after the show, the doctor who attended the Greek lover was overcome by what he had sadly witnessed.
“In this day and age we see a lot of things in our hospitals, especially from gay men who come in with all sorts of paraphernalia stuck up them, however what I saw with this chap should be dealt with in medical journals. All I’m going to say is, it was somehow inside out. A thousand times worse than anything George Michael could have come up with, another Greek love aficionado.”
The American talk show host, Jess Jessup Jessup, was calm at first but noticed some nasty goings-on from the seat where Milo had perched his well-used posterior.
“I noticed some bubbling frothy stuff. Then the smell hit me. It smelled like an abattoir with raw sewage mixed in with the sounds of wind. Farting for these fellows is different to normal people though because their sphincters are so loose, this was the sound of wind going through shutters. Backstage Milo had mentioned just being serviced by a pack of black guys, so I assumed rightly, Milo was having a prolapse right there and then.”
Stitch up
Luckily for the talkative narcissistic dilettante, he was rushed off to hospital with a plastic bag under his bottom. The stitch up operation should take months.
It’s only a matter of time before the poor chap may have to have the whole damn lot removed completely."
Hook Up Sites Tinder and Grindr Good For Population Control,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/21136-hook-sites-tinder-grindr-good-population-control.html,2016,"Because syphilis can stay mainly undetected if untreated it can remain latent in the body for years. In the late stages of syphilis, the disease damages the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints leading to early death.
Antibiotics are increasingly becoming redundant due to overuse and the  WHO  has warned of a coming cataclysmic disaster where many ailments are untreatable due to resistance.
“These people are spreading STIs around like candy and soon their diseases will not be treatable. It works both ways, deaths from syphilis and gonorrhoea will eventually cull these populations thinning the herd,” a clinical insider revealed.
What about HIV? Unfortunately it has not had the effect in population reduction that was needed. Although it is still prevalent amongst the gay population, it needs to make more in roads into the heterosexual population to become effective in reducing the population numbers.
Since the discovery of HIV/AIDS it has only killed 36 million, considering the global population is 7.5 billion and growing, it’s a drop in the ocean.
We must therefore encourage more sites like Tinder and Grindr, the more the better. These sites peddle death to the stupid, and less stupid people on earth can only be a very good thing.
App developers need to make in roads in creating more hookup apps tailored not only for the developed world but for the third world, especially nations like China and India as well as the African continent, where population growth is beyond unsustainable.
Once STDs like syphilis explode in these regions, which are wholly untreatable, they will continue to spread like wildfire.
The creators of Tinder and Grindr should be commended for their great works, you have fired the starting gun in the race to reduce the global population before it is too late. Promiscuous risky sexual encounters should be encouraged at all junctures to spread STIs.
Finite resources are being permanently depleted daily, and it is only a matter of time before the Malthusian nightmare is upon us. Estimated projections for global population growth are 11.2 billion by 2023 according to the UN.
This cannot be allowed to happen, so please go on Tinder and Grindr now, and do your bit. You can catch chlamydia, genital warts, HIV, syphilis and gonorrhoea, maybe all at the same time."

Frankly we’re disgusted at the news and refuse to give any more meat until we’re given our rightful place at the dinner table again,” Daisy, a British White cow told the Cow Times.
The widespread use of horse meat in cows was only published yesterday after scientists tested the DNA of numerous high street supermarket beef burgers.
The cows have said they will picket slaughter houses until horse meat is removed from beef burgers.
“It’s just not right  innit . If you’ve got a beef burger, you want cow in there, not a f*cking horsey,” Brenda, another striking cow said."

The Tesco Value range lager costs 23 pence a can and has been a big hit across the country.
After an independent laboratory recently tested the beer, it was discovered to contain 89% horse and 11% donkey urine.
“That Tesco value beer’s like rocket fuel and it has a lovely frothy head. I was drinking it at a friend’s barbecue last summer, you know with those 100% beef burgers and all. Good times, innit,” Gavin Munter, 23, from Walsall told the BBC news.

Internal Organ Removal Diet Could Be Next Big Thing,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3930-internal-organ-removal-diet-could-be-next-big-thing.html,2013,"“Essentially we remove unnecessary organs from your body so that you will be thinner and lighter however much you eat. For example, take out a lung, maybe a kidney, half your liver and the majority of your intestines and you are guaranteed to lose weight and be lighter. In some patients we have seen drastic weight loss although they did not live long enough for us to conduct more tests on the efficacy of the weight loss system,” the doctor told the American Medical Journal.
The new diet was leaped on by overweight stars like Roseanne Barr, Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O’donnell who have sung its praises.
“I was taken to a medical facility in Beverly Hills where they removed my gallbladder, one kidney, one lung, and had my pancreas taken out. I went in in the morning and was out by 2pm it was incredible, they even showed me what they took out in a bucket on the floor of the operating table. Dang, I couldn’t believe all that stuff was in me no wonder I was so heavy, I’m sure glad it’s all out,” the now svelte talk show host Rosie O’donnell told CBS’s Morning Show.
The fashion industry has been using the doctor’s organ removal services secretly for years with models fed up of snorting cocaine all day long.
Even former glamour model Katie Price has asked Dr Lisswowski’s assistance to remove her brain but after extensive cranial scanning he could not locate it. She has since opted for her humungous basketball silicon breast implants to be reduced slightly.
Michelle Obama is also pushing her husband to include the Organ Removal Diet to be covered by Obamacare.
Tanya Turlington, a woman’s diet activist has spoken out against the organ removal diet and suggested a reliable diet resource that could instead help with losing excess weight without surgery.
“People need all of their internal organs, so please folks don’t get them taken out just so you can look like a size zero,” she told Woman’s Weekly magazine.

Concentration Camp Diet Latest Hollywood Celebrity Weight Loss Craze,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3977-concentration-camp-diet-latest-hollywood-celebrity-weight-loss-craze.html,2013,"Doctor Arnold Weiss pioneered the diet which claims to be able to shift the fat like no other diet in the world.
“Once you pay for the Concentration Camp Diet, you can kiss the flab goodbye forever. You won’t just lose weight you’ll never see it ever again, that is if you survive.”
The controversial diet starts as soon as the client enters the doctor’s office in Beverly Hills and pays $17,800.
“As soon as you pay, we own you. There is no get out clause once you sign the contract. The clients are rounded up at gunpoint by the diet guards, put in a crowded cattle truck and transported to our secret camp somewhere in the Mojave desert. There is no food or water for the eight hour journey and when they arrive they are pushed out onto the platform in front of the barking Alsations. The clients are then directed to either go left or to the right depending on their weight. The Concentration Camp Diet regime lasts for 10 months and is so gruelling that some clients don’t make it,” the doctor revealed.
Steven Spielberg was even consulted to design the Concentration Diet camp to replicate his masterpiece film, Schindlers List.
Paris Hilton has already signed up and so has Lindsay Lohan. Roseanne Barr signed up 11 months ago but no one has heard from her since.
One prospective client luckily escaped the ordeal by finding an alternative method of losing weight and saved herself thousands of dollars as well as possibly her life. Others, were not so lucky.
“They put us in a striped uniform and made us break rocks all day under the beating sun. Whenever I hear someone speaking German now I hide under the table. They fed us one piece of stale bread every two weeks and even pulled the fillings from my mouth while I was still awake. I thought I was at a Sea Org Scientology camp sometimes it was so brutal,” Gina Frankel, a client who lost over 18 stone (252 lbs) in weight during her sentence, revealed to Woman’s Weekly magazine.
Peaches Geldof, who goes through about five different  celeb fads  a week is now looking into the Concentration Camp Diet because she says that it sounds “so with it”."
Theresa May Wants My Organ and Yours Too,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/26394-theresa-may-wants-organ.html,2017,"Ain’t that great, whether I like it or not, my internal organs or organ are up for grabs thanks to the new Theresa May directive pushed at the latest Tory conference by a spluttering, coughing old bint well past her sell by date.
“I actually felt very sad for the PM watching her speech, if that’s what you want to call it, it was a real tear jerker and she managed to soldier on to the end coughing up half a lung, when even the letters were falling off the sign behind her. Walking off stage with her P45 in her pocket, she looked like a broken woman. I believe I shed a few tears to see such a sad distraught creature wilting along. She can have my organ, she can have my kidneys, my liver, whatever, stick ’em in a bowl with some fava beans and a bottle of nice Chianti,” a Tory conference attendee said after Theresa May finished her speech.
Luckily, one can opt out of having their organs harvested out to some Nigerian NHS-tourist in for the weekend to have a lung transplant, then absconding without paying a penny to anyone.
Yes, there are people who need organs urgently, your best bet is to go to China where you can have anything ordered, and served up to you in a jiffy from one of the many convicts who are killed off daily and have their organs harvested on the spot via a  special van  that appears out of nowhere to do the dirty deed.
Maybe Theresa May could introduce such a scheme in Britain, how about parking the van outside parliament?"

Serious Professional Misconduct
This is the last drop of  Midazolam  for Hancock, who is currently in hiding, and is packing his bags to skip any enquiry and get back into the jungle.
This time, there will be no TV cameras filming the grinning fuck head while he pretends to be a nice bloke. It will just be Hancock, mosquitos and a few crocs.

Eating Disorder Helpline Takes Down Chatbot After It Promotes Disordered Eating,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/51979-eating-disorder-helpline-takes-down-chatbot-after-it-promotes-disordered-eating.html,2023,"An eating disorder helpline has already announced that it is bringing its human staff back after firing its entire human staff and replacing them with a chatbot.
And yes, as it turns out, it’s because replacing a human-managed crisis helpline with an AI-powered chatbot showed extreme poor judgement. Who would’ve thought?
The National Fad Diet Association, the largest eating disorder-focused non-profit in the US, had decided to completely disband its heavily-trafficked crisis helpline in favour of a human-less chatbot called Big Betsy, just four days after its human workers were fired.
But that all changed when Gina Flatliner, an activist, sounded the alarm that Big Betsy was offering wildly unhelpful advice. She even suggested behaviours associated with disordered eating.
“Every single thing Big Betsy suggested were things that led to the development of my eating disorder,” Flatliner revealed in a YouTube video whilst munching on an 18″ stuffed cheese crust pizza on Monday. “This robot causes harm. Hmm, can you pass another tub of ranch please?”
In her harrowing YouTube post, Flatliner recounted that Big Betsy urged her to lose up to two pounds a week by eating pizza, nachos, trifle and a daily four buckets of spicy chicken wings washed down with a few gallons of 7-up. The bot, told the activist to “throw her weighing machine out the fricking window”, restrict certain foods like green vegetables, and avoid plain water like the goddamn plague. Big Betsy’s advice aimed to increase her caloric intake by, 5,500-15,000 calories per day. In other words, a chatbot entrusted with giving advice to people with eating disorders ended up promoting disordered eating.
Flatliner’s experience doesn’t sound like an outlier, either.
“Imagine vulnerable people who can’t control themselves reaching out to a robot for support because that’s all they have available and receiving responses that further promote pizza, burgers, burritos, hot dogs and cakes,” wrote psychologist Chips Onshoulders in an Instagram post sharing screenshots of herself stuffing two quadruple sized cheeseburgers into her mouth at the same time.
“I just ate six burgers; fifteen hot dogs, two large pepperoni pizzas, five huge buckets of chocolate chip ice cream and washed it all down with three gallons of Cola…burp… all because the bot told me to do so,” another client, Jenkem McMasters revealed crying into his tub of ranch dressing.
“We have taken Big Betsy down ever since its malfunctions. I think the last straw was calling one of our clients a “fat obese useless-eater Untermenschen who deserves to be flushed down the toilet of history” when talking about our Body Positive program."
Man Praises STI Dating App Hinder For Giving Him Genital Warts,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/52838-man-praises-sti-dating-app-hinder-for-giving-him-genital-warts.html,2023,"STI Dating app Hinder, which has 75 million users, has been going from strength to strength, spreading  sexually transmitted infections to millions of users globally . One 23-year-old man has publicly praised Hinder for giving him Super Gonorrhoea and suppurating genital warts as large as walnuts.
The TikTok star even showed off his walnut sized genital warts before milking them of green puss into a bucket, explaining his gruelling daily regimen.
“Thanks to Hinder, I now carry this shit around like luggage. There’s no known cure, so I have to sit here every day for three hours milking my bulging genital wart walnuts. I also have acquired HIV and Herpes from using the dating app. I’m proud of my condition, and I still rarely use a condom,” J.R Hartley, 23, a milkman from Leeds, told his 35,000 TikTok fans.
Last year, over 45,000 Hinder app users died from their conditions, but such is the efficacy of these dating apps for population control that Bill Gates himself praised the app.
“I love these dating apps because they spread disease and viruses very fast, and most of the stuff is incurable. Most STIs are immune to antibiotics these days. It’s a great tool for population control, and we want more of these people to be as promiscuous as possible. Eventually, and hopefully many will expire, and it’s all down to their lifestyle dictated by these apps.”
Hinder’s CEO, Tuborg Urethra, praised his app for reducing the population.
“These idiots are so base that they pay me large amounts of their own money to effectively hinder and lower their life expectancy. Last year’s revenue alone nearly reached 40 billion dollars, and we hope to have another bumper year. Thank you fuckers, by the way, keep spreading that shit around, it’s a win-win situation for us.”"

Elevate Your Snacking Experience: Advantages of Organic Almonds,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54563-elevate-your-snacking-experience-advantages-of-organic-almonds.html,2024,"A lmonds stand out as one of the most nutritionally rich nuts, frequently hailed as a superfood by numerous dietitians. However, what distinguishes organic pasteurised almonds as a superfood? How might their incorporation into your diet contribute to enhancing your overall health?
Almonds boast an impressive protein content, delivering approximately 21 grams per 100-gram serving—equivalent to 42% of the daily recommended intake. Meeting your body’s protein needs, which amounts to around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight, becomes effortlessly achievable through almond consumption. Whether you’re aiming to replenish post-workout or enhance protein intake, incorporating almonds into your diet is a nutritious and convenient choice.
Elevate your skin and eye health with the abundant Vitamin E found in almonds. A 100-gram serving provides approximately 63 mg of Vitamin E, surpassing 171% of the recommended daily intake. Harness the antioxidant properties of Vitamin E by incorporating almonds into your daily nutrition, offering natural nourishment over supplement reliance. Studies show that consistently incorporating this antioxidant into your diet is an effective  immune system supplement , among many others.
Harness the power of almonds to support a robust cardiovascular system. Rich in heart-friendly monounsaturated fats and antioxidants,  organic almonds  especially contribute to reducing the risk of heart disease. By effectively lowering LDL levels (commonly known as bad cholesterol), almonds play a key role in promoting heart health. Research indicates that diets incorporating 20% of caloric intake from almonds can lead to a remarkable 12.4mg/dL reduction in LDL levels.
Elevate your cognitive well-being with almonds, recognised for their exceptional brain-boosting properties. Additionally, if weight management is a goal, almonds prove to be a satisfying and low-calorie option, thanks to their high fibre content. By curbing overeating and offering essential nutrients, organic pasteurised almonds support both your brain and overall health.
Elevate your digestive well-being with the remarkable fibre content in almonds, promoting a smoothly functioning gut. With approximately 12 grams of fibre per 100-gram serving, almonds contribute to regular bowel movements and overall gut health. To maximise the prebiotic benefits, ensure consumption of almond skins. Healthy eating goes a long way for such a small food item.
Opting for organic, pasteurised almonds becomes a key strategy to safeguard yourself from harmful chemicals, pesticides, and synthetic preservatives. Almonds, lacking an outer shell, are vulnerable to pesticide absorption, particularly due to their high oil content. By choosing organic varieties, you eliminate exposure to unwanted chemicals and prioritise your well-being and the commitment to an organic choice serves as a proactive step to avoid potential health risks associated with pesticide-laden alternatives.
Investing in organic unpasteurised almonds doesn’t just offer nutritional benefits; it also extends to convenient and economical storage solutions. Unlike their pasteurised counterparts, unpasteurised almonds demand careful storage due to their fresh oils. While pasteurised almonds boast a shelf life of up to six months in an airtight container, unpasteurised almonds require quicker consumption to avoid rancidity."

Then I looked in the mirror, lo and behold I had changed skin tone to Lib Dem, or as many say, the colour of fresh urine after a night out on the piss,” the deputy prime minister told his audience on LBC’s morning radio talk show call-in.
Doctors who examined the Lib Dem leader have concluded that Mr Clegg does not have jaundice and have given him a clean bill of health.
“I’m fitter than ever, however I have noticed a strange smell emanating from the pores in my skin, it kind of smells like a urinal. I’m not sure how this happened?” Mr Clegg said."

Well, we have GM vegetables and fruits that can sprout legs and walk to your waiting mouth saving you a whole lot of trouble. The old days of knives and forks are over folks, welcome to the future,” professor Harold Fenster, project leader on the GM Food Trotter project told New Scientist magazine.
Depending on how hungry a person is, the GM food has different levels of speed and urgency in which it will find its way to your mouth.
“You might be late for work. No problem, just tap on the table three times and the GM food hurries up. A word of caution though, you don’t want to tap too much or you could choke with GM food traffic,” another scientist on the project revealed.
The new GM food will be available in shops in 2016 after further tests are completed."

Like there could be contamination from other sources, so gentlemen and some ladies, when you’re eating out your next seafood platter please ask that it has been cleaned first, or better still forego the hors d’oevres and just proceed to the main course. Please remember to be careful there too.”"
Vinnie Jones Working as Anaesthetist in Russia,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4140-vinnie-jones-working-as-anaesthetist-in-russia.html,2013,"“They bring ’em in. I look at ’em. Bosh! Done! They’re out!” Jones said about his new job as an anaesthatist.
The football hard man, who is more accustomed to squeezing Gazza’s meat and two veg, was looking for a new challenge to the usual meaningless Hollywood scripts he is given these days.
“I beat one man up, then thump  anuvver . I thought why not do that for the good of someone instead.”
The cash strapped Russian hospital said they treasure Vinnie’s work and want him to stick around.
“We can’t afford real anaesthetic, usually we give the patient some vodka. We hired Vinnie Jones for free, he thumps them so hard they’re out cold for days,” chief surgeon, Vilnius Nomskiya, told the Ural state television broadcasting service."

Don’t Work So Hard It’s Counter Productive Say Experts,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4345-dont-work-so-hard-its-counter-productive-say-experts.html,2013,"It is the common belief that hard work is a necessity in life but a team of experts are now saying the contrary is true. Hard work is extremely harmful to one’s sensibilities and in the modern world people need to stop working hard and relax more.
“Doing nothing is a great achievement in itself and will fulfill your life’s purpose with enormous rewards. Please do not adhere to the constant propaganda that you must work hard. Discard it and enjoy yourself instead. Laziness in the modern age should be celebrated as the technical side of things have already been taken care of,” Graham Labotomy, a key member of the research project told the BBC.
In the report it states that man should deem leisure activities as infinitely more important than hard work and also revealed how too many people working hard in the world just cause more problems.
“Simply put, there are too many people working hard. That’s a very bad thing because they’re doing things that they do not need to do. Laziness is the true standard and governments across the world need to promote that instead of work. Laziness is a more productive force, because lazy people find ways to do things in an easier more efficient fashion.”"
Michelle Obama Uses New Superfood Cockroach Milk in Her Morning Cereal,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/28729-michelle-obama-uses-new-superfood-cockroach-milk-in-her-morning-cereal.html,2018,"Former first lady, Michelle Obama today extolled the virtues of cockroach milk, a new  superfood  for the health conscious champagne socialist set.
“This is lactose free amino-acid rich goodness all in one. Protein rich and yummy. I pour the cockroach milk over my cereal in the morning and have a few drops with my coffee,” Mrs Obama told Marie Claire magazine.
In October, Michelle Obama will be featured in her own Netflix show to promote healthy eating to Americans.
Said to be the superfood for the Millennial era, many are even harvesting their own Hawaiian Pacific Beetle cockroaches at home, then milking them daily to extract the gooey milk that holds protein crystals.
Hannah Gutter, a democratic party worker from Los Angeles has even named her cockroach brood, consisting of 240 cockroaches which she houses in her tiny apartment she shares with her girlfriend.
“I love my cockroaches, I even name them, like see the one with spot on its back, that’s Spot, and the other one over there mating, that’s Harvey. I hope he got consent.”
Milking time
Extracting the milk from a cockroach can be a tedious business, and it takes Hannah four hours a day, but it’s worth every minute, in her point of view.
“You pick them up one by one, then I rub their crotch area gently slowly picking up the pace. When you hear this clicking agitated excited sound, you know they’re close to popping. That’s when they usually shoot their gooey milky load all over the place, so you have to catch it in a cup. Afterwards some of them get really sleepy, and I put them in a quiet place to sleep it off.”"
WHO – COVID-19 Fatality Rate Upgraded to 3.4% Will Rise Higher With More Data,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/35813-who-covid-19-fatality-rate-upgraded-to-3-4-will-rise-higher-with-more-data.html,2020,"“This virus is not SARS, it’s not MERS, and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  said  Monday from the Geneva HQ. “We are in uncharted territory.”
“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died,” the WHO Director-General revealed. In comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected, he added.
Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies program, also spoke at the conference:
“Here we have a disease for which we have no vaccine, no treatment, we don’t fully understand transmission, we don’t fully understand case mortality.”
It is a positive point that the WHO has upgraded the death rate to 3.4% as more International data is processed, and not on false Chinese data used previously, however the death rate in some regions would be more akin to 8-10% if recorded properly.
The WHO seems to praise China’s response to the virus at every conference, despite the massive cover up employed by the communist regime.

EU Directive Will Force Europeans to Eat Insects For Protein,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/37148-eu-directive-will-force-europeans-to-eat-insects-for-protein.html,2020,"While members of the unelected EU Commission will dine daily on the finest gourmet food from traditional protein sources like beef, chicken and fish, regular citizens will have a choice of maggots and insects for their daily protein intake.
The Farm to Fork Strategy is at the heart of the  European Green Deal  aiming to make food systems fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly.
Constantin Muraru from the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed ( IPIFF ), an EU non-profit organisation which represents the interests of the insect production sector revealed the nutritious qualities of insects.
Europeans were once acclaimed for their assortment of exquisite cuisine, but now under EU regulations, the peasantry will be forced to resort to crushed maggot paste and insect mush to eat daily. One could say it is not as bad as Soylent Green, but if humans are forced to eat insects in the future, who is to say that the next step will not be reconstituted cadavers?
“In essence, to sustain the EU politburo and our vast expense accounts, there will need to be cuts for the lesser population. You will eat insects, and we will eat filet mignon, of course, from the finest grass fed cows. You will drink maggot juice, and we will drink the finest champagne. C’est la vie, mes amis,” one member of the EU Commission quipped before leaving for their appointment at one of the most expensive restaurants in Brussels.

The fact that the coronavirus strain is a deadly  biphasic pathogen  that  reinfects people  means that subjects cannot come up with resistance. This is of course of no concern to the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Josef Vallance Mengele, he  directs the sheep to the slaughter  with ease, smiling with pride at his work.
Herd Immunity Herd Mentality
“It is a work of joy, the children will become infected with coronavirus, then distribute the virus so that more than 60% of the population catch it, then many millions will die. I am the Chief Medical Officer, and no one can dare to even doubt me, or question my authority. These fools follow me blindly and without question to their deaths, lemmings, sheep, call them what you want, the majority will be incinerated without thought,” Dr. Vallance Mengele said with glee.
Coronavirus: More young patients being admitted to hospital, Italian doctor warns
All that is needed is compliance to the orders, you will send your children to their deaths, and you will in turn be infected.
It is for your own good, ‘herd immunity’ but the funny thing is, there is no herd ‘immunity’ to certain death by drowning in your own lung fluid.
The sheep must follow, they have no mind, they are the herded sheeple, and they gladly walk through the slaughter house doors without a bleat of protest."
Obese Giraffes Causing Trouble in Africa,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4419-obese-giraffes-causing-trouble-in-africa.html,2013,"“These giraffes are not only a danger to other animals and humans but themselves as well. We had one obese giraffe sit down and accidentally crush a sleeping pride of lions, and one obese giraffe mother nearly squashed her new born baby. We have put them on special diet shakes so they can lose some of their weight,” park ranger, Blik Rosenthall, told the Serengeti Gazette.
The myriad of problems created by obese giraffes are a cause for concern for park staff, who believe that safari goers are the ones fuelling the fatty giraffes.
Another park ranger revealed: “We get these mainly American safari visitors giving them Twinkies and hamburgers. We try to tell them to stop but it is very hard to regulate. It’s not just what they eat in one end, but what comes out the other end is usually bigger than an elephant poo.”
In total there are approximately 43 obese giraffes now ambling slowly around the protected safari park, and vets are determined to bring the number of fatties down.
Chief veterinarian, Dr. Janice Bartends, who has adopted the obesity fight says: “We need to get them back to eating twigs and leaves. Some of our giraffes now weigh over 850 lbs, that’s close to half a tonne. We cannot have this going on anymore.”"

Coalition government officials said this was good news for the already straining NHS.
“The crumbling NHS is struggling already with the death pathway service. We appreciate Britain’s energy firms stepping up efforts to finish off the elderly and vulnerable at a quicker pace.

Lighting up a cigarette is detrimental to your health and frankly will not help the situation. I’m sure you would probably be crapping in your pants anyway.

Doh! Even Royalty Gets Cancer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54766-doh-even-royalty-gets-cancer.html,2024,"Who would have thought it, even members of the royal family get cancer. From the multitude of surprised press reports about King Charles getting the Big C, you would think that the royal family are viewed as superhuman beings, or in David Icke’s case — reptilians from the Draco constellation.
There is a fundamental difference of course in the treatment a prominent member of the royal family receives to that of the general public. They recieve the highest level of medical care and the best doctors who are on hand at all times to serve the royal cancer patient. This is in stark contrast to someone who is probably on the NHS, where an appointment for treatment can be over 6 months ahead, and by that time the patient will have deteriorated drastically. Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in the world, but if you are a royal it’s okay, you are in good hands.
It has not been revealed what type of cancer the monarch has, but it is almost a certainty that he will be cured soon enough, and all this hoo-ha will be gone.
The release of the information about King Charles’ illness is somewhat suspect, however it could be a way of normalising cancer as it becomes way more prevalent in these times. Microplastics, chemicals, food wrapped in plastic, and high amounts of sugar and hormones pumped into everything all play a part in the modern lifestyle of millions of people. Normalising something like cancer, when it used to be quite a rare occurrence, is also a way of surreptitiously covering up the epidemic.
It is however with a sigh of relief to know that the members of the royal family are not reptilians, and are just normal human beings who are from a certain protected lineage.
David Icke claims in his books that the royal family are part of the blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian race from the  Alpha Draconis  star system, now hiding in underground bases, and are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world’s ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family."
The Benefits of Having a Home Gym,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57149-the-benefits-of-having-a-home-gym.html,2024,"C reating a home gym is becoming an increasingly popular choice for fitness enthusiasts. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or someone who is just starting on their fitness journey, having a dedicated space to work out at home offers plenty of benefits. This guide will explore the advantages of having a home gym, including the benefits of garage flooring options.
One of the most significant benefits of having a home gym is the convenience it provides. No more commuting to the gym, waiting for equipment to become available, or dealing with crowded spaces. You can work out whenever it suits you, whether it’s early in the morning or late at night. This flexibility can be a game-changer, especially for those with busy schedules.
Time-Saving
Without the need to travel to and from a gym, you save valuable time that can be better spent on your workout or other activities. This can make a substantial difference in maintaining a consistent fitness routine, which is crucial for achieving long-term goals.
Customised Workouts
With a home gym, you have complete control over the equipment and the type of workouts you do. You can tailor your gym to your specific fitness needs and preferences, ensuring you have everything you need to meet your goals.
When setting up a home gym, particularly in a garage, the flooring is a critical aspect that shouldn’t be overlooked. The right flooring can protect your equipment, provide a safe and comfortable surface for exercising, and even help with noise reduction.
Durability and Protection
Garage floors are typically made of concrete, which can be harsh on your body/joints and your equipment. Installing specialised gym flooring, such as rubber mats or tiles, can provide a cushioned surface that reduces the harsh impact on your joints during high-intensity workouts. Additionally, this type of flooring helps protect your weights and machines from damage.
Easy Maintenance
Gym flooring is designed to be easy to clean and maintain. Spills, sweat, and dirt can be quickly wiped away, ensuring your workout space remains hygienic and clean. Rubber flooring, in particular, is resistant to moisture and can withstand heavy usage without showing signs of wear and tear.
Noise Reduction
One of the less obvious but equally important benefits of proper gym flooring is noise reduction. Dropping weights or running on a treadmill can create a lot of noise, which might disturb other members of your household or neighbours. Rubber flooring helps to absorb these sounds, making your workouts quieter and more enjoyable.
A well-organised home gym is more efficient and enjoyable to use. Effective storage solutions are essential, especially if you’re working with limited space, like in a garage. Storage boxes and other organisational tools can help keep your gym tidy and ensure that everything is easy to find and access.
Versatile Storage Boxes
Storage boxes  are an excellent solution for keeping your gym equipment organised. They come in various sizes and can be used to store anything from small accessories like resistance bands and yoga blocks to larger items like kettlebells and dumbbells.
Benefits of Storage Boxes:
Wall-Mounted Racks and Shelving
In addition to storage boxes, consider installing wall-mounted racks and shelving. These can hold items like barbells, plates, and even bicycles, freeing up floor space for your workouts.
Benefits of Wall-Mounted Solutions:
Cost-Effectiveness
While setting up a home gym involves an initial investment, it can be more cost-effective in the long run compared to a gym membership. Over time, the savings on membership fees, transportation costs, and time can add up significantly.
No Membership Fees
Gym memberships can be expensive, and those costs add up over time. By investing in your own equipment, you eliminate the need for monthly fees and can create a gym that suits your needs perfectly.
Increased Property Value
A well-designed home gym may add value to your property. Potential buyers may view a home gym as a desirable feature, potentially making your home more attractive on the market.
Health and Wellbeing
Having a home gym can have a positive impact on your overall health and wellbeing. The convenience and accessibility make it easier to maintain a regular exercise routine, which is crucial for physical health.
Mental Health Benefits
Exercise is known to improve mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Having a dedicated space at home to work out can provide a much-needed escape and a way to manage daily stressors.
Family Fitness
A home gym can also encourage family members to get involved in fitness. It provides a shared space where everyone can work towards their health goals together, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.
Creating Your Ideal Home Gym in The Garage
Setting up a home gym, particularly in a garage, offers numerous benefits that can enhance your fitness journey. From the convenience and flexibility it provides to the cost savings and health benefits, a home gym is a worthwhile investment. Focusing on essential elements like durable flooring and effective storage solutions ensures that your gym is safe, organised, and enjoyable to use. With the right setup, you can create a personal fitness haven that supports your goals and promotes a healthier lifestyle."
Travelling with Mobility Aids: What You Need to Know,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/lifestyle/travel-lifestyle/57680-travelling-with-mobility-aids-what-you-need-to-know.html,2024,"T ravelling enriches our lives by allowing us to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create lasting memories, however, for elderly individuals or those using mobility aids, travelling can often present challenges. With careful planning and the right information, these challenges can be minimised, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable trip.
This article is your comprehensive guide to travelling with mobility aids, providing you with practical advice and valuable tips to make your travels as seamless as possible. From packing essentials to choosing accessible accommodations, navigating airports, and everything in between, we’ve got you covered.
Mobility aids range from walking sticks and canes to wheelchairs and scooters. Those with limited mobility may also require the assistance of bathroom aids when travelling, such as commodes. Each type of aid has its benefits and specific uses, making it crucial to choose the right one for your needs when travelling.
Walking Sticks and Canes
Walking sticks and canes provide essential support and balance for those with mild mobility issues. They are lightweight, easy to carry, and can be adjusted to suit individual height requirements. When travelling, opt for a foldable cane that can be conveniently stored in your luggage.
Additionally, a  rollator  can serve as an excellent option for those who require more stability or need a place to rest during walks. Rollators come with wheels and a seat, allowing users to take breaks when necessary, making them a practical aid for longer journeys or those with varying terrains.
Bathroom Aids
Bathroom aids, such as a portable  commode  or shower chair, can make a significant difference in maintaining hygiene and comfort while travelling. These aids are particularly useful for individuals with limited mobility or those staying in accommodations that may not have fully accessible bathrooms.
Packing for a trip can be daunting, especially when you need to consider mobility aids. However, with a well-thought-out packing list, you can ensure you have everything you need for a comfortable and hassle-free journey.
Mobility Aid Accessories
When packing your mobility aids, don’t forget to include essential accessories. For canes and walking sticks, pack extra rubber tips and a carrying case. If you’re using a wheelchair or scooter, bring spare batteries, a charger, and any necessary tools for adjustments or repairs.
Medications and Medical Supplies
Ensure you have an ample supply of all necessary medications and medical supplies for the duration of your trip. It’s a good idea to keep these items in your carry-on bag in case your checked luggage is delayed or lost. Additionally, bring a list of your medications and medical conditions in case of emergencies.
Travel Documents and Insurance
Travel documents, such as your ID, passport, and boarding passes, should be easily accessible. Consider using a travel wallet to keep everything organised. It’s also wise to have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and any mobility aid-related issues that may arise during your trip.
Finding the right accommodations is crucial for a comfortable and enjoyable trip. When booking your stay, prioritise accessibility and ensure the property meets your specific needs.
Researching Accessible Hotels
Most hotels and vacation rentals should have accessible rooms and facilities on offer. Look for properties that highlight their accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and grab bars in bathrooms. Reading reviews from other travellers with mobility challenges can provide additional insights into the property’s accessibility.
Contacting the Property Directly
Before making a reservation, contact the hotel or rental property directly to confirm their accessibility features. Ask specific questions about room size, bathroom layout, and any additional services they may offer, such as wheelchair rentals or assistance with luggage.
Considering Location and Transportation
Choose accommodations in convenient locations close to public transportation and attractions. Having easy access to transportation options can make getting around much more manageable and reduce the need for long, tiring journeys.
Airports can be overwhelming, especially for those with mobility challenges, however, with a bit of preparation and knowing what to expect, you can navigate airports with ease.
Requesting Assistance
When booking your flight, notify the airline of your mobility needs and request assistance. Most airlines offer services such as wheelchair assistance, priority boarding, and help with luggage. Confirm these arrangements a few days before your flight to ensure everything is in place.
Going Through Security
Security checkpoints can be a bit tricky with mobility aids. Inform the security staff of your mobility aid and any medical devices you may have. They may perform a manual inspection or use alternative screening methods to ensure your safety and comfort.
Using Airport Facilities
Many airports now have specialised facilities for travellers with mobility challenges, such as accessible restrooms, designated waiting areas, and shuttle services. Take advantage of these amenities to make your airport experience more comfortable.
Road trips offer flexibility and the opportunity to see sights along the way. However, travelling by car with mobility aids requires careful planning to ensure a smooth and enjoyable ride.
Ensuring Vehicle Accessibility
If you own a vehicle, make sure it is equipped to accommodate your mobility aids. This may involve using a wheelchair-accessible vehicle or installing a ramp or lift. If you’re renting a car, contact the rental company in advance to confirm they have accessible vehicles available.
Planning Rest Stops
Long car journeys can be exhausting, so plan regular rest stops to use accessible facilities. Research the route in advance to identify rest areas, restaurants, and petrol stations with accessible amenities.
Packing for Comfort
Make your car trip more comfortable by packing essentials such as cushions, blankets, and snacks. Ensure your mobility aids are securely stowed and easily accessible during the journey.
Public transportation can be a convenient and cost-effective way to travel.
Researching Accessibility Options
Before your trip, research the accessibility options for the public transport systems you’ll be using. Many cities offer accessible buses, trains, and trams with features such as low floors, ramps, and designated seating areas.
Communicating with Transport Staff
When boarding public transport, communicate your needs to the staff. They can provide assistance with boarding, securing your mobility aid, and ensuring you have a comfortable ride.
Navigating Crowded Areas
Public transport can get crowded, especially during peak hours. Plan your trips during off-peak times when possible to avoid the rush and ensure you have enough space for your mobility aid.
Once you arrive at your destination, it’s time to explore! Here are some tips to help you make the most of your trip while using mobility aids.
Exploring Accessible Attractions
Many tourist attractions now offer accessible facilities and services, such as ramps, elevators, and guided tours for individuals with mobility challenges. Research and plan your visits to these attractions in advance.
Participating in Local Activities
Don’t miss out on local activities and experiences. Many destinations offer adapted tours, accessible nature trails, and workshops designed for individuals with mobility aids. Check with local tourism offices for recommendations.
Staying Safe and Healthy
Travelling can take a toll on your body, so prioritise your health and safety. Stay hydrated, take regular breaks, and listen to your body. If you experience any discomfort or health issues, seek medical assistance promptly.
Travelling with mobility aids can sometimes feel isolating, but there are many ways to connect with others who share similar experiences.
Joining Online Communities
Join online forums and social media groups dedicated to travellers with mobility aids. These communities offer a wealth of information, support, and inspiration from individuals who understand your challenges.
Sharing Your Story
Inspire others by sharing your travel experiences on social media or through a blog. Your stories can provide valuable insights and encouragement to fellow travellers with mobility aids.
Travelling with mobility aids may require extra planning and effort, but the rewards of exploring new places and creating lasting memories are well worth it. You are not alone in this experience, reach out to online communities, attend meetups, and share your experiences to build a supportive network of fellow travellers with mobility aids. With the right preparation, the world is yours to explore!"
Labour Condemns OAPs to Riding Buses and Sleeping in Libraries This Winter,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57369-labour-condemns-oaps-to-riding-buses-and-sleeping-in-libraries-this-winter.html,2024,"Old age pensioners  will be condemned to riding buses and trains all day and sleeping in libraries this winter just to stay warm. Other methods to keep warm are being explored by some innovative OAPs who have had their winter fuel payments snatched from them by the Labour government who have already squandered billions pandering to the Marxist unions, propping up unionised job sectors that are already swimming in grotesquely high salaries. Ten million pensioners will be affected by this heartless and evil decision to punish pensioners. Labour condemns OAPs in Britain to a tortuous, sad ending of their lives.
So, how can you stay warm when you are a lonely, old, possibly sick pensioner? One of the main ways is to stay in an area where there are lots of people. Examples of this would be shopping malls, train stations, buses, libraries, airports, hospital cafés, leisure centres.
Libraries
Libraries are always a good bet, although the government is shutting many of them down. There are free newspapers, so pensioners can even put a few layers of newspaper on their bodies for an extra layer of warmth. Most libraries open at 9am–6.30pm, and some libraries even close at 8pm. If you can afford to take a flask of tea or soup, that can help as well. Libraries are nice and warm and generally with minimal noise levels, so sleep can be accommodated quite easily.
Shopping Malls
Not everyone has a shopping mall near them, but if you do, then it would be good to capitalise on this. Shopping malls are usually well heated places away from the brutal cold and rain. You can sit in many places as there are benches in most areas. Due to most businesses going bankrupt, a lot of shopping malls in Britain are nearly empty, so the noise levels won’t be so bad. The best days to go are during weekdays, but best to avoid the weekends as there is a slight increase in footfall.
Underground Trains and Stations
If you live in London, get on the Underground. It’s nice and warm down there, and when the train comes through the tunnel, and you’re on the platform, you get a nice waft of warm air. Get on the train and ride it all the way to the end of the line and back. You can do this all day, catching some sleep along the way. Rush hour is a bit shitty, but if you’re seated, no worries. Take a small blanket if you need one, a flask and some sarnies. The best line to use is the Piccadilly Line because it goes all the way up to Heathrow from Cockfosters station. Overground stations are also an option but not as warm as other options, plus there are too many grifters, tramps and weirdos around.
These are some of the options available for OAPs during the 6 months of bone chilling winter in the UK. If you have dementia, then please ask for help from someone when getting on the trains and buses to stay warm. The irony is that the very train drivers who have been unjustly awarded £80,000 salaries at the expense of OAPs thanks to the unions and Labour will be the ones ferrying you around day in day out as you fight to keep warm. As Labour condemns OAPs to a life of living hell, it’s a good thing that they are at least caring for the pampered and very rich train drivers as well as ASLEF Union staff supping at  Claridges ."
Healthy Living Hacks: Small Changes That Make a Big Difference,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58517-healthy-living-hacks-small-changes-that-make-a-big-difference.html,2024,"In  today’s fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can seem daunting. However, adopting small, manageable changes can lead to significant improvements in your overall well-being. The key is to focus on habits that are simple yet impactful, making it easier to stay consistent. In this guide, we’ll share some practical health hacks to help you live your best life — starting today.
Dehydration can cause fatigue, headaches, and even reduce mental clarity. Starting your day with a glass of water not only rehydrates your body after hours of sleep, but also kickstarts your metabolism.
For an extra boost, add a slice of lemon or a pinch of sea salt for natural electrolytes. This small habit can set a positive tone for the rest of the day.
Ensuring you get your daily vitamins and minerals is crucial for maintaining energy levels, immune function, and overall health. But let’s be honest: remembering to take large pills or carrying bulky supplement bottles isn’t always convenient.
Enter  dissolvable vitamin strips . These portable, fast-absorbing strips are a game-changer for anyone with a busy schedule. Unlike traditional pills or gummies, dissolvable strips are easy to carry, require no water, and dissolve quickly in your mouth, delivering essential nutrients wherever you are.
They’re perfect for anyone who struggles with swallowing pills or simply wants a no-fuss way to stay on top of their health.
Good sleep is the foundation of a healthy life. It impacts everything from your mood to your immune system. Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night and establish a bedtime routine to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.
This could include:
When paired with a balanced diet and the right supplements, like vitamins, quality sleep can significantly enhance your overall health.
You don’t need a gym membership or a gruelling workout plan to reap the benefits of exercise. Incorporate small bursts of movement throughout your day to keep your body active. Take the stairs instead of the lift, stretch during work breaks, or go for a 10-minute walk after meals.
Consistency is more important than intensity when it comes to exercise. These little moments of movement can improve circulation, reduce stress, and even help with digestion.
Meal planning doesn’t have to mean spending hours in the kitchen or creating overly complicated recipes. Start by focusing on nutrient-dense meals with a balance of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.
Batch cooking grains, roasting vegetables, and prepping proteins in advance can save time and ensure you have healthy options ready to go. For days when life feels too hectic, rely on simple add-ons like a smoothie or a  dissolvable vitamin strip  to fill in nutritional gaps.
Mental health is just as important as physical health. Incorporate short breaks into your day to recharge. Whether it’s a five-minute mindfulness session, a quick walk outside, or simply standing up and stretching, these small moments can reduce stress and improve focus.
Hunger strikes can lead to unhealthy food choices. Avoid this pitfall by keeping healthy snacks, such as nuts, fresh fruits, or yoghurt, on hand. For an extra health boost, combine these snacks with vitamins to maintain steady energy levels throughout the day.
Living a healthier life doesn’t have to involve radical overhauls. By incorporating simple, yet effective habits like staying hydrated and moving more, you can make a big difference in your overall well-being. These small changes are easy to stick with and can pave the way for a healthier, happier you.
Start small, stay consistent, and watch how these tiny adjustments transform your life!"
The Facts and Myths About Collagen: Is it Really Worth the Hype?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58710-the-facts-and-myths-about-collagen-is-it-really-worth-the-hype.html,2024,"If  you’re trapped in the social media wormhole every evening and can’t resist your nightly TikTok or Instagram Reels scroll, then you’ll have watched a video or two about collagen and how we’re all pretty much screwed after 25 years old.
Men have it slightly better – testosterone and male androgen secretions keep men’s skin younger looking for longer. And they start with thicker, plumper skin, making the appearance of fine lines and signs of ageing less obvious.
Actually, contrary to popular belief, men start to lose collagen earlier and more consistently throughout their lives and women hold onto more until menopause. Once the menopause kicks in, it’s a bumpy ride until you reach the other side, ladies.
Anyway, we digress. We’re here to talk about collagen and whether it’s really worth the hype. Read on to find out.
Let’s start with some myth-busting – there are definitely a lot of people spreading fake collagen news and selling fake collagen products:
Myth 1: Collagen is Only for Women
Collagen benefits everyone. Studies show it effectively supports muscle recovery and joint health. We’d say it’s a great supplement for athletes and the ageing population, but people don’t talk about how effective it can be for other reasons besides ageing.
Myth 2: All Collagen Supplements Are the Same
Absolutely not. There are so many variations (and yes, they matter). Marine collagen is better for the skin. Bovine collagen is better for joint and ligament support. And sometimes you don’t even need a supplement. If you’re wondering, ‘ do anti-wrinkle injections work? ‘ – they absolutely do work for boosting collagen production if they contain hyaluronic acid. Always do your research and find high-quality collagen supplements!
Myth 3: Collagen Causes Acne
There’s no evidence that collagen supplements trigger acne. Clogged pores and hormonal breakouts are more likely to be the issue.
Myth 4: Collagen Works Overnight
Collagen supplements take time to show effects. Sadly, it’s not an overnight fix. Weeks or months of persistent use will begin to generate the results you’re hoping for.
Now let’s move on to the facts about collagen that’ll get you wanting to try it:
Well,  people are going crazy for it  because of social media – and we wouldn’t say this is a negative thing. There are so many benefits to the endless videos about cosmetics and skin health. People are more aware of UV damage, taking collagen supplements, and using the correct skincare products; we’re not against the trend.
As for collagen, people are drawn to its anti-ageing benefits. The world seems to be hooked on staying younger for longer. And that’s why we think it’s a trend right now – it’s purely TikTok and other social media platforms, but we don’t think that’s a bad thing.
Yes, absolutely it is. If you can find the correct collagen supplement, and it’s high-quality, it’s absolutely worth the hype. It can and does produce results. Combine it with anti-wrinkle injections and the best skincare products, and you really will reduce and slow the signs of ageing. Oh, and of course, a healthy lifestyle and diet and 2L or more of water!
The confidence boost it’s giving people is incredible.
Ultimately, collagen isn’t a miracle cure – we won’t deny that. But we will follow the craze and say it really does have incredible benefits. Don’t knock it until you try it!"
Is a Classroom Not an Enclosed Space?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/44455-is-a-classroom-not-an-enclosed-space.html,2021,"During times of high viral infection, restaurants and other venues where people congregate en masse are closed off to protect the further infection of the population. Why is a school classroom any different to a packed restaurant, gym or pub?
Technically speaking, a school classroom is still an enclosed space where people are breathing and talking in close proximity to each other. Boris and his government have vowed to keep schools open whatever the infection rate, therefore, this will lead to increased deaths as vulnerable parents/teachers or children bear the brunt of this hard-headed policy. The Omicron virus does not distinguish between business types or industries, it only sees humans in enclosed spaces breathing upon each other. The closer humans bunch themselves, the better opportunity for the virus to spread. Masks of N95 rating are good, but people neglect the eyes, where miniscule water droplets carrying the virus will land and enter the body, multiplying with ferocity.
If you do not wear an N95 rated mask or higher in public, you might as well not be wearing a mask, therefore this is where much of the population fails miserably by wearing cheap paper masks that are worthless when it comes to the virus.
Of course, where children are concerned, they are unfortunately wonderful asymptomatic carriers of the virus simply because of their youthful antibody strength and metabolism, therefore, should we not only safeguard their welfare but those who will come into contact with these superspreaders? Vaccines do not protect from infection or spread, they are meant to reduce hospitalisation or the severity of the virus. Thankfully, the UK is not seeing the same rate of death or hospitalisation as the first wave in 2020 due in part to the mass proliferation of the vaccine program, however the rate of infection is currently at an exponential level, and there seems to be no end in sight.
By keeping schools open at a time of exponential viral infection levels is highly irresponsible behaviour by the current Boris administration. This sort of hard-headed obstinate policy goes against all medical or scientific advice, and is a serious conduit for a major NHS horror show that will encompass any other periods in its history.
What’s an A-level or GCSE worth if you’ve killed your teachers and relatives?"
5 A Day: EU Vegetables and Fruit Full of Cancer Causing Chemicals,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/46009-5-a-day-eu-vegetables-and-fruit-full-of-cancer-causing-chemicals.html,2022,"Have you had your 5 A Day portions of dangerous cancer causing EU vegetables and fruit?
The Pesticide Action Network ( PAN-Europe ) has revealed most of the fruit and vegetables from the EU analysed had traces of chemicals used in the most toxic types of pesticides, linked to cancers, cardiovascular problems and diabetes. They can also be highly toxic to the environment, poisoning rivers and other precious ecosystems.
The analysis, based on almost 100,000 samples, highlights a 53 percent increase in contamination by the most hazardous pesticides found in fruit over the period 2011-2019. PAN Europe’s report shows an 8% increase in the proportion of contaminated fruits and vegetables, compared to 2015-2017.
It seems the European Union’s stringent rules and  diktats  on other countries’ exports do not extend to the EU’s exports of fruits and vegetables, and for the sake of massive profits they are exporting deadly chemically cancer causing produce to Britain and other parts of the world.
So much for the supposed EU standards in food production, as the evidence plainly shows that there is complicity in the production of such deadly, toxic fruit and vegetables.

"Bye, Bye NHS !",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/47523-bye-bye-nhs.html,2022,"In years to come, you will sigh as you say ‘remember the NHS‽’ it will be a distant memory, something cast to the farther reaches of the mind. Some will have fond memories of ye olde National Health Service, others will not.
In true human tradition, anything that is inherently good and supposedly free in this world is eventually abused, corrupted, violated, and plundered.
The NHS was a socialist utopian dream that was not free, though. The money to pay for it had to come from somewhere. Socialists firmly believe that there is a magical  socialist money tree  somewhere that bears 100 pound notes as fruit for eternity. Yes, it is a lovely thought, but reality is not something socialism as a political ideology close to communism is aware of.
The Labour government of Attlee, who created the NHS, did not factor in an NHS used by half the earth’s population.  Beveridge , who designed the NHS and Benefits system, actually was a eugenicist who stipulated that anyone who received benefits from the state should be sterilised. His lofty thoughts on that matter were unfortunately never adopted.
You see, the NHS as a system can function beautifully within a parameter where the nation’s population is relatively low, but it cannot function where the population is massively enlarged, and mainly consisting of non tax paying perpetually unemployed people.
There is no solution to a hugely oversubscribed entity bleeding money through terminal mismanagement and needless waste apart from complete collapse.
You may think things are all right when you eventually get a phone consultation with a GP in three weeks time, but your three-week wait and two minute rushed phone consultation is a very pertinent sign that all is not well in the NHS. In the 1950s, if you revealed that things would be like that in 2022, they would laugh at you.
Decades of unfettered mass migration into the UK from the world’s poorest countries encouraged by socialists effectively killed off their own socialist NHS dream. Prime Ministers like Tony Blair opened the floodgates into Britain, and the country is paying for this now as the people who came over were not rocket scientists, IT professionals or doctors, they were predominantly uneducated useless economic migrants from the poorest EU countries looking for British benefits…i.e the same sort of people coming over in dinghies from France every day by the thousand.
Okay, in defence of the likes of Blair and the socialists, their overall plan was to gain votes for elections by simply importing them into the country by the million, however with this strategy they did not realise they would not only overload the benefits system, but they would kill off their sacrosanct socialist project — the NHS. Finis!"
Five Tips to Relieve Stress,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/47620-five-tips-to-relieve-stress.html,2022,"S tress is something that many individuals experience. Several aspects of daily life can increase stress levels, including work, family problems, health issues, and financial responsibilities. Chronic stress raises your chance for illnesses like cardiovascular disease, anxiety, and depression. Thus, it is essential to understand how to manage stress to improve one’s quality of life. Below are some tips to relieve stress.
Moving your body may benefit you if you’re feeling stressed. Regular exercise has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and depression. Start with easy activities like walking or biking if you are currently inactive. You may improve the likelihood of continuing exercising over time by picking one you enjoy.
Vitamins and minerals are vital for the body’s ability to respond to stress and control mood. Having insufficient amounts of both may damage one’s mental health and capacity to handle stress, so it’s essential to make sure that you get enough each day. 
Aside from supplements,  CBD flower  can potentially help you feel less restless and reduce anxiety. Some hemp varieties may make you feel euphoric and relax your nerves, which may – should this happen – boost your daily life.
Every area of overall health, including mental health, is hugely influenced by food. Chronic stress may cause  overeating  and leaning toward extremely appetising foods, both of which can be detrimental to general well-being and disposition.
The lack of nutrients like B vitamins and magnesium, that are essential in the control of stress and mood, may increase your risk of nutritional deficiencies. To ensure that your body receives the proper nutrition, you should limit the amount of highly processed beverages and meals and increase your consumption of whole foods like vegetables, fruits, and fish.
Making time for yourself each day could help you feel less stressed. Walking outside, reading a great book, getting a massage, and doing yoga are some examples of self-care activities. Self-care has been linked to reduced stress levels and better quality of life, whereas neglecting your needs increases the likelihood of stress and burnout. Self-care doesn’t have to be complicated. It simply means taking care of your happiness and well-being.
When you are under mental stress, your sympathetic nervous system is activated, putting your body into a fight-or-flight response.  Stress hormones  cause the body to respond by speeding up respiration, the heartbeat, and blood vessel constriction. The parasympathetic nervous system, which governs the relaxation response, may be activated with deep breathing techniques.
Exercises for deep breathing include breathing through the diaphragm, the abdomen, the belly, and at a set rate. Deep breathing aims to slow down and deepen your breathing by bringing your consciousness to it. Deep inhalations through the nose cause your abdomen to rise and your lungs to expand fully. Your heart rate will slow down, as a result, making you feel calm.
Stress is an inevitable part of life, and it has a negative impact on your physical and mental health if it persists. The good thing is that these techniques can assist you in reducing stress and enhancing your overall health."
Man Gifted With Case of Drug-Resistant Super Gonorrhoea,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/49125-man-gifted-with-case-of-drug-resistant-super-gonorrhoea.html,2023,"“It’s a gift that keeps on giving,” the man said as green puss flowed from the large boils on his appendage. According to US scientists, this particular drug-resistant strain has the ability to sidestep six of the seven drugs that health authorities track for potential resistance. It carries a change to the “penA60 allele” – a gene mutation – which has been linked to previous ceftriaxone-resistant cases in Nevada, the United Kingdom, and Asia.
“Thanks to sites like Tinder, Bumble, Grindr etc. these particularly nasty strains of Gonorrhoea can spread like wildfire,” one concerned CDC scientist revealed.
The man, who did not wish to be named, revealed that the drug-resistant super gonorrhoea strain he had contracted was relatively easy to manage.
“I keep a bucket around at all times and have to strain the goo into that, although sometimes the puss can squirt over a wide area. For example, my HD TV and sofa are now covered in the stuff. It’s painful to piss, sort of like needles in your pee pee hole. I still get Tinder dates and I don’t tell the women because it’s embarrassing. I also have HIV, Herpes, Syphilis, Chancroid, Hepatitis B, and now Gonorrhoea, but it’s all okay. The dates never realise until some time afterwards. I always persuade them to dump the condom. I’m good-looking with a 13″ Weiner, so I can get away with it.”"
HGH : How Hormone Therapy Helps Women?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40388-hgh-how-hormone-therapy-helps-women.html,2021,"P erhaps one of the most life-changing medical procedures a woman can undergo is a hysterectomy.
For those who are not familiar with hysterectomy, these are surgical procedures that involve the removal of a woman’s uterus and in some cases other reproductive organs. When this happens, her menstrual cycles will stop, and she will lose the ability to become pregnant.
According to a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 600,000,42 hysterectomy is done in America each year, with the average woman receiving one around XNUMX the age of 18.
The success rate for hysterectomy is quite high in women who undergo them to combat specific health problems, some of which include fibroids, pelvic pain, endometriosis and a prolapse uterus.
Sometimes hysterectomy is also recommended for women diagnosed with uterine or cervical cancer.
What every woman should know before having a hysterectomy
As for hysterectomies, the end of a woman’s menstrual cycle and the inability to conceive are only part of what she can expect after surgery.
Before describing the additional side effects that a woman is likely to face, let’s take a moment to look at the three types of hysterectomies that a doctor may recommend depending on their patient’s health.
Partial hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing a woman’s uterus while leaving the cervix intact.
Standard hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing both the uterus and the cervix.
Total hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing the uterus and cervix. In addition, the surgeon will also remove one or both ovaries and the fallopian tubes.
Regardless of the type of hysterectomy procedure a woman undergoes, she is likely to experience several short-term side effects afterwards. Some of these short-term side effects may include the following:
• Pain and inflammation at the incision site 
• Sweltering or itching stir near the incision site 
• Numbness near the incision
Although short-term side effects are usually resolved, women who have undergone a complete hysterectomy may experience long-term side effects that sometimes require additional medical treatment.
Some of these long-term side effects, which are also often associated with menopause, include the following:
• Hot flushes 
• insomnia 
• Night sweats 
• Vaginal dryness 
• low libido 
• Low bone density
How hysterectomy can affect a woman’s hormone levels
Many women who have undergone a hysterectomy often struggle with hormonal deficiency, and this is especially true after a complete hysterectomy. According to online science-related press releases, total hysterectomy may increase the risk of early menopause in younger women with almost double the increase.
In short, this means that women who undergo these types of hysterectomies, in addition to hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, vaginal dryness and low libido, may also experience hormonal imbalances.
In fact, some women who undergo a hysterectomy, which involves removing one or both ovaries, experience a loud drop in  estrogen and progesterone  production.
This drop is caused by a reduction in the production of human growth hormone, which is unfortunately another side effect of undergoing a hysterectomy for many women.
HGH Therapy After Hysterectomy
To combat many of the side effects that follow hysterectomy, many women turn to human growth hormone (HGH) replacement therapy.
This form of therapy, given by injection, provides the same level of symptoms’ relief in women after hysterectomy that does this for menopausal women.
Given that low levels of growth hormone often led to low levels of estrogenic and progesterone, it makes sense that many doctors recommend growth hormone replacement therapy along with traditional treatments consisting of estrogenic and progesterone replacement therapies.
Some doctors even recommend therapies to replace growth hormone over estrogen and progesterone, as it is less likely to lead to complications.
For reference, a study published by the  National Cancer Institute  found that estrogen replacement therapies can increase a woman’s chances of developing blood clots, gallstones or stroke.
In addition, when combined with progesterone or another bio identical hormone, such as progesterone, may increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
How does HGH therapy work to combat the side effects of hysterectomy?
When it comes to hormone replacement therapy, which involves the use of growth hormones to combat the side effects of hysterectomy, the long and short point is that these treatments help to restore a woman’s growth hormone levels to a healthy and normal state.
In response, her estrogen and progesterone levels also return to normal and healthy.
Once her growth hormones, estrogen, and progesterone return to normal, the side effects that follow a hysterectomy, such as night sweats, low libido, hot flashes, and low bone density, for example, will begin to subside.
In addition, her chances of developing breast or uterine cancer will also decrease.
Some of the most prescribed HGH-based medications that doctors prescribe to women after a complete hysterectomy include the following:
• Genotropin 
• Humatrope 
• Norditropin
How long does it take for HGH alternate therapy to work?
If you are thinking of starting HGH-based replacement therapy to alleviate the side effects after a hysterectomy, you are probably wondering how long it will take to see results.
If so, you’ll be glad to know that for most women, these treatments take effect almost immediately. However, long-term improvement in symptoms can take 3 to 6 months.
In summary, although human growth hormone alternate therapy is a relatively new approach to combating the side effects induced by hysterectomy, there is evidence to prove that it is just as effective as estrogen replacement therapy. Moreover, according to most doctors, this is significantly safer in comparison."

Man Gets Obola in USA,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/9878-man-gets-obola-usa.html,2014,"CDC officials said the man did not enter the country with any papers, identification or even a social security number.
“This man is of no fixed abode and may have infected millions with Obola. It’s a disease that has no known cure, and is infectious to Democrats and zombies alike,” a senior CDC official revealed Monday.
The announcement comes only days after a top German virologist revealed that five million people would die in Obola-infected nations within Africa not including those who travel to the USA to infect others through the open borders.
Speaking on Fox news, Bill O’Reilly said: “I nearly got Obola, but good thing I’m a Republican. Last I heard the whole MSBNC crew have contracted Obola and ain’t that a crying shame.”
Just this week, the CDC began advising funeral homes on how to handle the remains of Obola victims while simultaneously attempting to downplay the threat.
The U.S. State Department ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits, dark eye shades, ear muffs, specifically for Obola earlier this month.
“If you see Obola on the TV or internets, please switch off immediately, either that get to your nearest Obolacare center for quarantine,” Dr. Ralph Greenbaum, told ABC news."
Rachel Reeves: “Killing sick kids in hospices is fine with me!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58990-rachel-reeves-killing-sick-kids-in-hospices-is-fine-with-me.html,2024,"When it comes to hardcore socialism and communism, there is no limit to its evil, and Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is the epitome of a nasty, nefarious tax hungry agenda that is hurting and crippling hospice charities trying to look after sick young children.
It is certainly true that throughout history, communism and socialism have brought upon more death than any other political ideology. It is of no consequence for the likes of Rachel Reeves, hiking the National Insurance tax to such unnecessary levels that it will cost England’s children’s hospices over £5m more every year to barely function. Palliative care, especially for children, is being crippled and on its knees thanks to the unjust NI hikes by Labour’s tax hungry chancellor.
The unsustainable and destructive increase in Employers’ NI Contributions announced in the  Halloween Budget  ultimately amounts to £134,000 extra in staff bills next year. In total, the cost of providing care will rise by a devastating amount, which will result in drastic staff cuts and essential hospices for children forced to close, or severely inhibit their operations.
Reeves is taxing the UK into oblivion. What kind of stupid moron calls themselves an ‘economist’ by taxing everything to death? This is not how you get ‘economic growth’ this is how you kill the economy and kill the farmers, the kids, and every business trying to survive in an increasingly hostile Britain which is now being led by the heartless and  sleazy Labour Party  who are more concerned with  sponging freebies  than making the right decisions.

"Younger People Succumbing to COVID-19 Brazilian, South African Strains",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/41377-younger-people-succumbing-to-covid-19-brazilian-south-african-strains.html,2021,"Young people with no underlying conditions and seemingly healthy constitutions are now appearing in COVID-19 death statistics with increasing frequency.
A 16-year-old with no known underlying health conditions  died from COVID-19  days after figures showed a 13-year-old without known underlying conditions had died. The deaths all occurred last month but illustrate that young people are just as susceptible to death from COVID-19, especially as the deadly Brazilian and South African strains are now spreading across Britain.
Naturally, the  opening of schools will be a great conduit for Coronavirus to spread  further into population centres especially with the increased footfall. Even though there is now a program of lateral-flow testing in most schools, this is a lagging indicator, and only addresses the problem after the infection has taken place. For some, this could mean a definite death sentence.
It will take a few weeks or months for what is happening today to be apparent in governmental statistics, but the  massive jump of cases in Europe  should also be another consideration. The borders are still open from the Continent into the UK with little or no checks, as infected people come through the ferry ports and through the Eurotunnel.
The  Brazilian COVID-19 P.1. Strain  is a particularly nasty piece of work, and is currently causing mayhem in the region it came from. It can spread far more easily and vaccinations may not be as effective, although further research is ongoing.
The  British Kent COVID-19 B.1.1.7. Strain  also spreads with more ease than previous mutations, as does the  South African B.1.351 Strain , each of these variants have differing characteristics that affect the recipient in multiple ways, depending on the general health, genetic makeup of the person infected.
Scientists have also discovered another mystery  B1.525 Strain  which is similar to the Kent variation including the  E484K  mutation, but its origins are unknown as yet.
As schools, shops and restaurants etc all open their doors again, it is guaranteed that infections and deaths will increase once again exponentially."
We Will All Get Covid,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43065-we-will-all-get-covid.html,2021,"Coronavirus has caused a significant loss of life and negatively affected the global economy.
When Covid struck the world in 2020, most of the countries went in to lockdown to contain the spread of the virus and reduce the sudden increased burden on their health care systems.
The hope at that stage was that a vaccine will soon be invented, and we will all get out of jail.
Good news was that researchers indeed managed to create some reasonably effective vaccines.
However, the vaccination programs took their time and only a small proportion of the world population is fully vaccinated so far.
Vaccination reduces the severity of illness, but does not stop us from getting infected with Covid.
Therefore, the only way forward is to vaccinate everyone and let everyone get exposed to Covid.
Unfortunately, some may succumb to Covid in spite of vaccination and this will be similar to what happens with flu infections, where some people still succumb to flu infection in spite of vaccination.
The challenge in doing the above will be in predicting how much will this cause a burden on health care systems.
It will be particularly challenging for countries like Australia & New Zealand, that went in to strict lockdown and completely closed off their borders with the rest of the world because a very small percentage of their population would have developed natural immunity to Covid, and they will have to vaccinate all of their adult population before opening their borders.
It is generally accepted that natural immunity is better than the immunity provided by vaccines. So, in theory, the countries that were not very strict with lockdowns may be at a slight advantage (in short term) compared to the countries that went for strict lockdown and closure of borders.

What are the Latest Fitness Trends of 2021?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43421-what-are-the-latest-fitness-trends-of-2021.html,2021,"H ealth and fitness will typically go through a range of different trends each year as more and more people look to become as healthy as they possibly can.
Indeed, there are a range of benefits that can be felt when trying to be more active, with mental and physical wellbeing being amongst the top advantages that can be achieved when an individual exercises, but the method in which they choose to accomplish those aims appears to change with each year that passes.
2021 is no different, either, as there is an array of different ways in which people are now exercising and trying to become a healthy version of themselves, especially after what they went through in 2020 and the various obstacles and challenges that would have been faced.
These are just some of the biggest trends to have emerged over the last eight months or so, with some perhaps more obvious than others.
Walking
One of the biggest fitness trends of 2021 is one that appears to have boom following 2020, as more and more people decided to take up walking in the great outdoors as a way of getting the blood pumping around the body and building up a sweat.
Whilst there may have been some who were using the best  treadmill  that money can buy in order to run or walk whilst indoors at home during the lockdown period that saw gyms closed for a long time, there will have been even more people who will have taken up walking outdoors.
This activity was one of the only forms of exercise many would have been able to achieve during 2020, and it seems to have continued into 2021 as they found that it was enjoyable and had significant benefits to their health; both physically and mentally. It also proved to be a great way for the mind to be refreshed throughout the working day, with many tending to go on walking breaks as a means of getting away from a screen and getting some fresh air.
Yoga
Yoga has always been an incredibly popular fitness trend over the last few years, but it could be suggested that more and more people have decided to take it up in 2021. Again, last year will have played a role for many, as this particular type of exercise helps an individual to remain calm and find their inner peace.
Furthermore, Yoga and Pilates help a person to look after their mental and physical being in a more conscious way, as they will slow down from their busy lives and take a break, whilst also looking to stay as mindful as possible in regard to their posture and alignment.
HIIT Workouts and Quick-Fire Sessions
Another big fitness trend that appears to have really made an impact in 2021 are the HIIT and Quick-Fire routines that can be completed pretty much anywhere, in the home, at the workplace or just generally outdoors.
HIIT stands for High-Intensity Interval Training, and these are short exercises that are designed to provide short bursts of exercise to those who may not have the time to complete a workout in the traditional amount of time that may be needed. For instance, there have been a number of apps to have emerged that help users to enjoy these programs, further highlighting how popular they have become."
Halal News: Everyone in UK is Now a Muslim,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/7660-halal-news-everyone-uk-now-muslim.html,2014,"“If you eat Halal meat you are adhering to the Muslim religious laws, therefore be a good Muslim now, do eat up your food, that’s a good chap,” Abdul Al-Haq, a Pakistani Muslim from Britain’s Good Cuisine Guide revealed today.
In fact it’s hard to find any meat in the UK now that is not  Halal .
Hamza Khaleeq Elsingham, the UK’s Minister of Food, reveals that eating Islamic food is good for you: “You will feel closer to Allah every day. Don’t forget to eat up your greens also, of course you can still have your mushy peas and gravy.”
Some English citizens are however having second thoughts about the Halal meat, Beresford Smith, an accountant from Cricklewood, who is a devout Christian, told the Daily Mail: “I ate my cottage pie last night for dinner. In the morning, I noticed a large bushy beard had grown on my chin. I then had this irresistible urge to kneel on my carpet and pray to Allah. By 11am I was at Tesco’s looking for four more wives, my current wife Deirdre was not too happy about it, she’s a vegan.”"
Are You Eating Halal Eggs?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/7791-eating-halal-eggs.html,2014,"Halal eggs are used in pretty much everything from your mayo to the chocolate cake you stuffed into your salivating mouth yesterday.
“I had an omelette this morning and then whilst on the train proceeded to read my copy of the Daily Mail. To say I was horrified at what I read would be an understatement. I realised that my omelette was made from halal eggs. I immediately stuck two fingers down my throat and vomited over the person next to me on the morning commute from Oxford,” Reggie Sanders, 56, a company director, told the Evening Standard.
Halal eggs are created by chickens who lay eggs in the Islamic fashion. They are first blessed by an Imam, then they are told to submit to God whilst laying their eggs. Factory farms across the UK all have resident Islamic priests who recite the Koran to chickens before they lay their eggs. The chickens also have to face Mecca and if they refuse are sent to be slaughtered, in the halal way of course.
This begs the question, what about Easter Eggs? Well, you think they’re Christian eggs, but they’re actually halal eggs squirted ritually from the bottoms of hens and painted like Easter eggs.
Nigel Farage of Ukip has vowed to  ensure all eggs in the UK are Ukip eggs when he wins the next election, seeing as he was unceremoniously yoked by a deadly halal egg on a recent walkabout."
Transgender Michelle Obama Wants More Rights,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/8697-transgender-michelle-obama-wants-rights.html,2014,"In a world where all the rivers are polluted by chemicals creating asexual animals, where the food that humans eat are tainted with plastics and pesticides creating birth disorders, it is no surprise that Michelle Obama, who suffers from Klinefelter syndrome is crying out for more rights.
Outed by former comedienne Joan Rivers, who was dispatched mysteriously shortly after making the announcement about the Obamas saying Michelle Obama is a man, there has been much debate about the transgender FLOTUS.
Speaking at a recent White House fund raising event for Homesexual Transgender Bi-Polar Bisexual Lesbian Sailor Jingle Drug Addicts with HIV and Hepatitis (HTBPBLSJDAHH), the  First Lady ‘s speech had many in tears:
Hiding in plain sight
“I tried to hide for so long, but look at my shoulders, look at my  hands , look at my Adam’s apple! Our adopted children thanks to Dr Anita Blanchard, have always supported us but there will always be a stigma. We are people too, we have feelings like anyone else, and we want to be acknowledged for who we are. I want you all to think for one second what it is like to have a larger penis than Barrack. I have to think about this every night before we go to bed together.”
The celebrity audience, included veteran comedienne, Joan Rivers (now deceased) who gave over $6.20 to the charity fundraising event."
Man Catches Ebola by Reading Ebola Article,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/9955-man-catches-ebola-reading-ebola-article.html,2014,"A man from Texas has caught Ebola by reading one of the thousands of Ebola articles in news outlets across the internet, the U.S. Authorities have revealed.
The unnamed man started to display the symptoms of Ebola immediately after reading an article on the infectious viral disease.
“One minute I was reading the piece and the next I was flailing around on the floor with my eyes about to explode,” the unnamed man said from his quarantine cell.
The moral of the story is…."
Have You Been Bitten by an Ebola Mosquito?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10123-bitten-ebola-mosquito.html,2014,"Imagine being bitten by an Ebola mosquito whilst you’re in deep sleep, you may not even hear that annoying whining sound or even feel it. Wake up in the morning have your brekkie and out the door to work, next day you’ve got fucking Ebola.
“It’s the trials of our times innit, you can get Ebola from mosquitoes because the virus is transmitted through blood and various other bodily fluids. At least vampires aren’t real, imagine having a vampire sucking your blood and transmitting Ebola into your bloodstream from a previous victim, that shit mingles. Leeches as well, no I’m not talking about the wife, talking about those little black things that stick on you and suck your blood, they’re nasty because they release an anaesthetic so you don’t even know they’re there. If you live in a country up in the northern hemisphere you should be relatively okay, but I do feel for those poor sods in hot countries,” a man in some pub said whilst drunk out of his head."
"Obola Quarantined, But For How Long?",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10303-obola-quarantined-long.html,2014,"“We have the Obola virus under strict quarantine and it is up to GOP officials to keep this highly contagious strain of virus under watchful eyes. Please remember to shut your eyes and ears if you encounter Obola on any media, especially where Obola flourishes in depositories like MSNBC,” a CDC official told networks today.
There are still extreme dangers around everywhere for the public, and Obola can make a resurgence infecting even more people, wreaking havoc amongst the populations, so stay vigilant and on your guard.

Six Work Environments That May Lead to Cancer Over Time,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/60412-six-work-environments-that-may-lead-to-cancer-over-time.html,2025,"C ertain workplaces expose employees to hazardous substances that may increase their cancer risk over time. From industrial sites to office buildings, prolonged exposure to chemicals, radiation, or pollutants can have serious health consequences. Understanding these high-risk environments is crucial for prevention and early detection.
In this article, we will explore six work settings linked to long-term cancer risks, helping workers stay informed and take proactive steps for protection.
Prolonged exposure to hazardous substances such as asbestos, benzene, formaldehyde, and heavy metals in industrial and manufacturing settings poses significant cancer risks. Workers in these environments often inhale toxic fumes, handle carcinogenic chemicals, or come into contact with radioactive materials. This increases their likelihood of developing lung, bladder, or blood cancers.
As per the  CDC , numerous exposures may lead to increased cancer risk, including industrial exposures. Approximately 2-8% of all cancers globally are caused due to long-term exposures to carcinogens in the workplace. Lung cancer was the most prevalent cancer worldwide in 2022. Specific industrial settings and tasks that increase the chances of lung cancer are rubber manufacturing, roofing, paving, painting, and chimney sweeping.
Poor ventilation, inadequate protective gear, and long work hours further heighten exposure risks. Without strict safety protocols, employees may unknowingly inhale or absorb these dangerous substances, leading to severe health complications that manifest years after initial exposure.
How can factory workers ensure they are not unknowingly exposed to hazardous substances?
Factory workers can protect themselves by wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and following safety protocols. They must ensure adequate ventilation in their work environment. Regular training on hazardous materials, routine health checkups, and staying informed about workplace risks can also help minimize exposure. Advocating for stricter safety regulations and proper handling of toxic substances can further reduce health risks.
These sites expose workers to hazardous materials like asbestos, silica dust, and lead. Constant exposure to these materials increases the risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, leukemia, and other serious illnesses. Asbestos is the major cause of mesothelioma.
A study by BMC Public Health found that the total number of fatalities due to occupational exposure to asbestos increased by 20.2% from 1999 to 2019. Approximately 80% of Mesothelioma cases are due to asbestos exposure.
Asbestos has a long incubation period, which is why it takes several years for the disease to emerge even after the exposure stops.
Inhalation of other airborne toxins from cutting, drilling, and demolishing structures makes proper protective measures essential. These sites generate massive amounts of waste, including concrete, wood, and metal debris, which can release harmful pollutants. Without proper disposal and safety protocols, both workers and nearby communities face long-term health risks from exposure to toxic dust and environmental contamination.
Firefighting and emergency response roles expose workers to extreme heat, smoke, and hazardous chemicals, increasing their risk of developing cancer over time. One major concern is aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), a chemical-based suppressant widely used since the 1960s to combat fuel fires.
AFFF was highly effective in smothering flames by creating a barrier, making it a standard in the military, aviation, and industrial firefighting. However, it contained per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.” According to TorHoerman Law, these chemicals are known as forever chemicals due to their persistence in the environment and the human body.
Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, leading to legal action against manufacturers. Many affected firefighters have filed a  firefighter foam lawsuit  to seek compensation for health damages caused by PFAS exposure. The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers knew about the health hazards but failed to warn the firefighters and the public.
Are there specific decontamination protocols to reduce chemical exposure after a fire?
Yes, firefighters follow specific decontamination protocols to reduce chemical exposure after a fire. These include removing contaminated gear, using wet wipes to clean exposed skin, and taking thorough showers as soon as possible. Proper laundering of protective equipment and ventilation of fire stations also help minimize long-term toxic exposure risks.
Hazardous chemicals, radiation, and infectious agents pose major health risks to healthcare and laboratory workers due to frequent exposure. Handling chemotherapy drugs, formaldehyde, and disinfectants can increase the likelihood of developing leukemia or other cancers. Many times, bacterial infections within healthcare settings can also lead to cancer.
Also, long-term exposure to X-rays and radioactive materials without proper shielding poses serious health risks. Laboratories also contain volatile organic compounds and biohazards that can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Without strict safety protocols, PPE, and proper ventilation, healthcare and lab professionals remain vulnerable to long-term occupational health hazards.
Agricultural workers and pesticide handlers face cancer risks due to prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals such as glyphosate, organophosphates, and carbamates. These substances, commonly found in herbicides and insecticides, can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested, increasing the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, etc.
Medical News Today  reported that glyphosate has been designated as a probable carcinogen by the IARC. It also led to legal settlements totaling $11 billion for plaintiffs challenging its safety. A more recent study determined that frequent glyphosate use is linked to an increased risk of all cancers, particularly colon and pancreatic cancer.
Frequent contact with contaminated soil, water, and crops further heightens exposure risks. Without proper protective gear, strict handling procedures, and regular health monitoring, farmworkers remain vulnerable to long-term health effects. Pesticide safety regulations are essential for reducing occupational cancer risks.
How long do pesticide chemicals stay in the body after exposure?
The duration pesticide chemicals stay in the body depends on the chemical type, exposure level, and individual metabolism. Some pesticides break down within days, while others, like organochlorines, can accumulate in fat tissues and remain for months or even years. Regular exposure increases the risk of long-term health effects.
Workers in mining and oil drilling face prolonged exposure to hazardous substances, increasing their cancer risk. According to Cancer.org, those in oil refineries and gasoline-related industries are routinely exposed to benzene, a carcinogen found in crude oil and gasoline. Studies link high benzene exposure to elevated rates of leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as lung cancer.
On the other hand, miners are exposed to hazardous substances like silica dust, coal dust, and other particulates. Exposure to radioactive materials and heavy metals, such as arsenic and mercury, further heightens cancer risks. Poor ventilation in underground mines and constant contact with drilling fluids amplify these dangers. Without strict protective measures, workers in these industries remain vulnerable to life-threatening occupational health risks.
Protecting Workers from Hidden Cancer Risks
Workplace exposure to hazardous substances remains a significant yet often overlooked risk factor for cancer. The above-mentioned workplaces expose workers to toxic chemicals, radiation, and airborne pollutants that can lead to severe health consequences over time.
Awareness, protective measures, and strict safety regulations are essential in reducing these risks. By staying informed, promoting safety, and getting regular health checks, workers can protect themselves from occupational cancer hazards."
Hospitals to Deliver Babies by Drone,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10723-hospitals-deliver-babies-drone.html,2014,"Drones are big business as online stores and postal services have been capitalising on their popularity by conducting logistical deliveries in the US and the UK, but what about babies?
Hospitals are now the next drone front line where drones could be replacing storks for that all important delivery moment.
“We’ve already trialled a few deliveries by drone this month and plan to roll out a more intensive service next month,” NHS planner, Rupert Sanders, told the BBC.
How does the drone delivery work, and what’s more, is it safe?
According to a recent consultancy funded by the government, drones are actually safer than midwives because they have less germs and are accurate to the millimetre. When the woman is in labour, the drone will be activated and will hover under the area where it calculates the trajectory of the baby expulsion will be. The specialist drones have a cushioned basket to catch the baby delivery. So far, tests carried out by the scheme have a 95% chance of success when catching the baby as it is being ejected from the mother.
“We can also deliver babies via drone to any address in the UK, of course after the mother has had her initial time with the newborn. Not all parents can take their babies home with cars and some live in rural secluded areas of the country,” Mr. Sanders revealed.
The NHS could save over £380 million per annum when the drone deliveries are rolled out in January 2015."
Gwyneth Paltrow: “I Like to Steam My Brussels Sprout”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/11263-gwyneth-paltrow-like-steam-brussels-sprout.html,2015,"The Gwyneth Paltrow kitchen is a pink temple to clean living and Hollywood celebrity fads. The actress’ many mesmerised followers always want more from her.
Speaking from the Soggy Box cafe in Santa Monica, the actress gave an account to lifestyle show, Flange, how her daily regimen is good for her health and well being: “There’s nothing like steaming. Ya know, I was looking through my warm glove box and was chuffed to find a cute little euphemistic recipe book there about steaming. I’m allowed one Brussels sprout a day so I got home and got my steamer out. A piece of wet lettuce, moist, crunchy right next to it on a plate, it was a paradise slice in a lady garden of dripping pink heaven. There were no badly packed kebabs or greasy meat curtains here stinking up the joint, just good ol’ wholesome steamed snug sprouts. That reminds me, I must have my vagina steam cleaned so it’s nice and tight.”
Next week, Paltrow will discuss how she consciously uncoupled herself from the temptations of a burrito."
NHS Prepared For Ebola?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/9940-nhs-prepared-ebola.html,2014,"“Ebola can be carried in any bodily fluid, sweat, tears, minuscule water droplets in someone’s breath, semen, blood, faeces and vomit. But there’s nothing to worry about as the flights from places like Liberia, Sierra Leone and other African countries arrive daily into the UK’s porous borders. It’s of course not only African flights, because many of the infected usually transit in mainland Europe before arriving in the UK. There is  no screening , and the infected may not show any symptoms for 21 days. During that 21 day period, one person can infect thousands, especially through sexual relations. There is a suspicion that  Ebola is airborne , it is highly likely that tiny water droplets in human breath can easily transmit Ebola when it is carried in the air to other hosts.
However, this Ebola mass infection does pose a few questions for the NHS. For example, if thousands of patients descend onto any hospital simultaneously will there be enough secure treatment rooms available? Most hospitals in England and Wales are hugely understaffed and overcrowded, mainly because of the treatment of immigrants from poor Eastern European countries wanting free health care. It does not take a brain surgeon to realise that any further influx of Ebola infected patients will seriously impact on already straining NHS hospitals and rapidly descend into chaos, thus infecting people further.
The UK is at an advantage with being an island only if it stops all air travel, as this is not economically viable for corporations and the British economy, airports will thus be left open to massive influxes from Africa and the Third World eventually leading to a possible pandemic of Ebola. If the UK shut all ports of entry during the coming Ebola global pandemic, then it would have a chance of survival, however the current government’s slack, apathetic attitude could lead to an eradication of large swathes of the British population in the foreseeable future.
There are further factors that will increase the severity of the Ebola virus: the virus is transmitted through sexual relations, as most Africans and other blacks have a high voracity for sexual relations, once they infect any member of the indigenous populations, then the virus will spread like wildfire. All it takes is some Ebola infected person to go to a nightclub and infect hundreds, as for the promiscuous nature of large portions of the public, this would be worse than AIDS because even the mildest of human contact will allow it to spread.
We are seeing incidents of doctors and nurses, heavily suited top to toe in hazmat suits, wearing filtration masks becoming infected whilst treating Ebola patients, putting this into consideration, what hope does someone in a crammed underground train have of not being infected?
The onus lies in survival. If the government were serious about Ebola they would stop air and sea traffic immediately, or prescribe a 25 day quarantine period for any travellers from outside the UK."
Obama to Meet and Greet Every Ebola Flight From West Africa,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10072-obama-meet-greet-every-ebola-flight-west-africa.html,2014,"“I’m going to meet and greet personally every African coming off those planes, there may be thousands, they may have Ebola but I want to show Americans there is nothing to fear. I will hug them, kiss them and shake their hands. We need to accommodate these poor people who are coming here for free health care and so what if they have  Ebola , it is their right as humans to infect as many people as possible. I’ll be on the front line, and I’ll be smiling and holding my head high because I’m right and you’re all wrong,” the president said on the tarmac of New York’s La Guardia airport as another flight from Africa landed yesterday.
Dmnongo Tchibilosa, 34, from Equatorial Guinea was eager to meet the president as he left the Ebola ravaged country on Saturday.
“We have been told we will be welcomed with open arms. I can’t wait to spread some Ebola to everyone in the United States. Oh, I meant spread some love. Thank you Obama, you have shown great African spirit by letting us all come to USA. Yay, who wants some Ebola lovin’?”"
Healthcare: Why Silencing Ebola Spread is Not Dangerous,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10357-healthcare-silencing-ebola-spread-dangerous.html,2014,"The silence on Ebola is deafening, and there may be a danger to this silence some might say, however health care officials think the virus is better out of sight, out of mind.
“The media have been told by agencies to hush any news about Ebola. You may have noticed a deafening silence, although the Ebola is still ravaging Western Africa and flights are still carrying infected people across the globe. It’s now a silent spread with zero reporting. Please do not worry about anything, because if the media does not mention this deadly virus, that means it is gone, vamoose, outta here,” Dr. Bill Edwards, a consultant for the U.S. Department of Infectious Diseases didn’t tell any news outlets yesterday.
Everything’s okay then, Ebola has been eradicated completely. Nothing to see here folks, move away."
Ebola in Britain Could Be Like Black Death,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10932-ebola-britain-like-black-death.html,2015,"Thanks to flights from infected African nations delivering thousands of people to Britain daily, Ebola, the highly infectious disease could be Britain’s return to the Black Death.
“Open borders, useless airport screening, and a buckling NHS are naturally good breeding grounds for any virus to flourish, especially one of the most virulent killers man has ever known, Ebola. Don’t forget that Ebola doesn’t show itself for 25 days after infection, and during that time it can be transmitted through bodily fluids. Sneeze in the underground, on the bus, touch a supermarket credit card reader pad, touch a fucking library book, ah the list goes on and on. How about nightclubs? How’s about some gal gets picked up by someone who just got off a plane from Sierra Leone or other African destination, goes back home, he does the business, now she’s got Ebola. She doesn’t know that, nah, then she gets a visit from her boyfriend, he sleeps with her, now he’s got Ebola. Those nightclubs and bars do get sweaty don’t they, well Ebola sweat isn’t like normal sweat is it? You get Ebola sweat on you, it goes in the pores and all,” a taxi driver told his passenger somewhere in East London on the way to a club on Saturday night.
The Black Death from 1348-1349 killed half the population of Britain."
Sarcophagus Found in A&E Could Go to British Museum,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/11037-sarcophagus-found-ae-go-british-museum.html,2015,"Jean Dremble, an A&E nurse discovered a sarcophagus on a hospital trolley in a corridor shortly after 4am on Sunday the BBC reported.
“Well, we have a lot of skeletons on trolleys so at first I thought nothing of it,” Ms. Dremble said of the incident.
After further inspection, it was revealed to be really, really old and will be sent to the British Museum for analysis.
Sunninghill hospital NHS managers were said to be ‘glad the thing was out of the way finally’ and one area of the corridor was clear."
"Fresh Term, Fresh Covid Infections: As Children Across the UK Return to School",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43473-fresh-term-fresh-covid-infections-as-children-across-the-uk-return-to-school.html,2021,"The definition of madness is doing the same thing over, and over again and expecting different results. Just as the moment of schools opening in Scotland showed a  doubling in Covid infections , the opening of schools in England and Wales will see a quadrupling of Covid-19 infections.
“I’ve got the kids all set up, new pencils, shoes, shirts, trousers, so when they contract Covid at school, they can come home on the bus and spread the virus everywhere. It’s vital they spread the virus to their grandparents, and other vulnerable people, so they can enjoy the benefits of Covid-19 as well,” a jovial parent remarked.
Boris Johnson has calmly remarked that he will tolerate  50,000 deaths per annum , however, the winter Covid wave thanks to superspreader schools and universities, will most probably involve 50,000 deaths per month. Everything is now open, and no one wears any masks anymore. There are, of course, other variables involved, such as viral mutations that make vaccines useless, and the slow decay of vaccine efficacy over time.
The C.1.2 ‘high consequence variant’ possesses multiple mutations that bypass current vaccines and allow the spread of the virus more freely than the Delta variant. First discovered in South Africa, cases of this variant have already been found across Europe and the  UK .
Yes, economic necessity is a reason to open all areas where the public can spend money, and the Brexit economy is doing wonderfully, but where does one cross the line between economic matters and the workers dying off? The West is still not technologically advanced enough in robotics and AI to replace the entire workforce. We can see the disparity in the workforce when we look at  British lorry driver shortages , which have resulted in empty shop shelves. Brexit Britain must ensure that British lorry drivers return to the workforce with financial incentives.
In the future, technology will have advanced enough to replace all driver jobs, as well as all other sectors, bringing additional problems to the fore. However, that is another story all together."
Kate Middleton is How Every Wife Should Behave,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/7439-kate-middleton-every-wife-behave.html,2014,"If you haven’t been living in an alternate universe, or some secluded island in the Pacific ocean without any access to the media, you will no doubt have come across multiple stories and picture exclusives of Kate Middleton (AKA The Duchess of Cambridge) everywhere with her husband the Duke of Cambridge.
Psychologist and royal physician, Professor Alan Tenderton, has said a few words about the Duchess and how every woman should treat her husband like Kate Middleton.
“Women need to treat their husbands like Kate treats William. She is totally compliant, subservient and is completely loyal to her husband William. I don’t know any man who would not want such a wife. She has shown herself to be completely dedicated to being a good wife and mother. This is what women today should be concentrating on, in serving their husbands, in a selfless loving manner, not answering back, not arguing and not trying to get one over the masculine as a lot of women do today. Kate not only looks good but radiates devotion to her man and she does not need to voice her opinions on anything until asked. Girls need to be taught at a young age to serve men, in all things, to accompany them and to step back from feminism, which is the antithesis of harmonious relationships with the sexes.”"
Masturbation Could Boost Your Immune System to Fight COVID,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43143-masturbation-could-boost-your-immune-system-to-fight-covid.html,2021,"Looks like staff members at the Daily Squib newspaper are now practically immune to the effects of Covid-19 and its many strains, seeing as doctors have revealed that masturbation boosts the immune system. It is a well known fact, Squib staff members have such highly developed muscles on their arms that many find it hard to find shirts that fit.
Five or six times a day by the Daily Squib’s editor alone, and he is still alive in the pandemic, is proof this system works just fine.
No more blue balls
Jennifer Landa, M.D ., a specialist in hormone therapy, has said masturbating might strengthen the body’s natural defence forces.
“Masturbation can produce the right environment for a strengthened immune system,” Landa told Men’s Health.
Men’s Health also cited a 2004 study that showed men had more white blood cells 45 minutes after they had a solo orgasm. For those who don’t know, white blood cells are part of the body’s immune system that help fight infection and other diseases.
According to the study by the  Department of Medical Psychology, University Clinic of Essen , Germany.
Whacking one out might not prevent infection, but orgasms generally help people relax and elevate mood that is key to a healthy immune system.
Dr. Felice Gersh, a gynaecologist and obstetrician who specializes in women’s health, said chronic masturbation might not prevent COVID, but “it’s not going to create harm.”
“I think the takeaway message is that there are no negatives from it,” Gersh said."
Scientists: China Guilty of Mass Genocide With Engineered Covid Virus,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/42465-scientists-china-guilty-of-mass-genocide-with-engineered-covid-virus.html,2021,"N umerous world renowned scientists and virologists have analysed the Covid-19 SARS-Coronavirus-2 pathogen and have come to the conclusion that the virus was most definitely engineered by humans, to attack humans. Scientists in China engineered the virus to cause maximum damage across the globe.
As the virus first came to the attention of the world in Wuhan, China, there is a large probability that it was engineered and released from the  Wuhan Institute of Virology  where the  CCP and PLA have been conducting military operations creating deadly viruses , weaponising them to cause huge amounts of worldwide death.
Further alarm bells have rung when more evidence was presented about the engineered virus strengthening the case against the evil Chinese regime that created this monstrous killer virus.
First , the virus binds more strongly to human ACE2 enzymes than any other species, including bats.
Second , SARS-CoV-2 has a “furin cleavage site” missing in its closest bat-coronavirus relative, RaTG-13, which makes it significantly more infectious.
According to Israeli geneticist, Dr. Ronen Shemesh, the Furin site is the most unusual finding.
Dr Shemesh, who has a PhD in Genetics and Molecular Biology from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and over 21 years of experience in the field of drug discovery and development, said it is even “more unlikely” that this insertion happened in exactly the right place of the cleavage site of the spike protein – which is where it would need to occur to make the virus more infectious.
“What makes it even more suspicious is that fact that this insertion not only occurred on the right place and at the right time, but also turned the cleavage site from a Serine protease cleavage site to a FURIN cleavage site,” he  added .
So far the Covid-19 virus engineered in China has killed in excess of  3.7 million  humans worldwide as of writing. The global economic cost of the Chinese virus is estimated at  10-15 Trillion dollars  so far."
"Opinion: Euthanasia, Assisted Dying Should Not be a Crime",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58642-opinion-euthanasia-assisted-dying-should-not-be-a-crime.html,2024,"We at the Squib firmly believe in free choice in all things. This involves death as much as life. The choice to die as one chooses is a choice that societal rules, legal laws should not take away from anyone. Euthanasia/assisted dying is a key to mercy from painful suffering.
To be in a state of constant physical pain where painkilling drugs have minimal effect is a form of prolonged torture. People who deny the choice to end this pain are effectively torturers, prolonging someone’s suffering needlessly.
Prolonging suffering in a dying animal is seen as a sin, so why are human animals any more different? The sanctity of life is viewed as sacred, but so should the sanctity of death be seen in the same light.
Death throughout human history has been shrouded in mystery and religious manipulation. It is something that has been needlessly feared, when in reality it is a simple transference from one state to another.
Today,  parliament  will debate the Assisted Dying Bill on whether to minimise suffering or prolong it for those in terminal conditions."
EU Ban on Powerful Vacuum Cleaners Impacting on Perverts,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/9353-eu-ban-powerful-vacuum-cleaners-impacting-perverts.html,2014,"Full scale riots and protests have erupted in some department stores over the new EU ban on powerful vacuum cleaners, the BBC reports.
A man who wished to remain anonymous but was filmed rioting in a BHS store in Leicester said: “We need these powerful vacuum cleaners. What business is it of the EU’s to restrict our enjoyment. The vacuum cleaners available now are just not up to the job.”
NHS staff were however said to be relieved by the new EU restrictions on vacuum cleaners.
“We get them in here regularly with vacuum cleaners stuck to their privates. It’s using up valuable NHS time and money trying to get these machines off their bodies,” one doctor revealed yesterday.
Meanwhile in Westminster, politicians were strangely quiet about the whole sordid affair."
Help My New Eco House Just Got Flooded,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/6555-help-new-eco-house-just-got-flooded.html,2014,"If there ever was proof of global warming this is it. I built my Eco house last June to much praise from my Eco chums only to see it washed away this morning in a biblical flood that would make a Christian devotee nod his/her head in confirmation of the fictional Noah story.
You see, here we are in little old Blighty doing all those little Eco things to save the environment but we’re not thinking globally. What use is any Eco drive on this tiny island when you have countries like China and the USA pumping out tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere daily? Do we not realise that those pollutants travel around the globe’s atmosphere?
Here’s a small thought, 1.6 billion Chinese people want to drive SUVs, they need all the mod cons, add in the Americans with their SUVs and lest we forget the Russians. How about the billions of factory farms, and the millions of factories churning out tonnes of heavy chemicals high up into the atmosphere on a daily basis? Last I looked America uses up 60% of the earth’s resources, now that’s one country! Please excuse me but shouldn’t America be classified as a world parasite, its greed is disproportionate to its benefit?
So all you Eco heads in the UK, you may think you’re doing something right, but the chemicals and carcinogens are pushed high into the atmosphere where they travel around the earth and slowly blanket the surface with poisonous malevolence. The pesticides, the steroids, the bisphenol A, the heavy metals you all ingest daily, you cannot see unless you are medically analysed. It’s in the air you breathe, it’s in the water you drink, it’s in a health conscious mother’s womb, and further more, no Eco drive in the UK will make a blind bit of difference because the factories and traffic are still churning out the stuff globally, even if the UK stops. Unless you have access to the latest chelation equipment that our masters use, and they’re exclusive food and water supply, it’s futile. By all means try and eat healthily while the skies are being sprayed daily, at least your outward appearance will please you, but if the polar bears are contaminated in the Antarctic what chance do you have?
Here I sit in a flood, my Eco house has washed away, and I look up to the atmosphere as more poisons created by industrial greed and overpopulation rain down on my head.
Ah, I just saw Harry and William on a day out, I feel much better now, help is finally at hand."
New Covid Strain: “Whole Wards of Children in Hospital”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40261-new-covid-strain-whole-wards-of-children-in-hospital.html,2021,"The new strain of Covid is now adversely affecting the health of children as is being witnessed at many London hospitals where there are whole wards full of kids with very low oxygen levels in their blood systems.
With Primary schools being forced to go back on Monday, and Secondary schools forced to open later, there is a good chance more children will be affected by the new strain, also leading to infection of more adults as the R0 level increases exponentially.
Only closing schools can keep Covid contained, new Imperial report warns
The perpetually confused Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson wants all Secondary schools to open on the 11th with mass covid testing. Covid testing does not solve anything, simply because you can test someone once, and five minutes later they can be infected. Once they are infected, they infect others, but it’s okay, ten minutes ago they had a clean bill of health via the covid test. Furthermore, PCR tests can be conducted on any individual multiple times coming up with differing results.
Blood on their hands
There is however a large proportion of parents who still wish to fob their kids off to school purely, so they can both work, thus using schools as a form of childcare. These selfish parents do not seem to care about the welfare of their own children and think only about making extra money, so they can buy useless things, and afford expensive holidays. If they really cared about their own children one of the parents would elect to stay at home, however greed and selfishness is all too prominent these days. Unfortunately, the government only sides with these selfish, greed-driven types of parents, and not with the other group who actually care for their own kids’ wellbeing.
The  insanity  of reopening schools after Christmas, will increase the infection rate and cause more death amongst the population.
The Daily Squib warned of the second wave occurring prior to the September school openings, but who the fuck are we anyway?  All of our projections have now come to fruition , and it is because of the footfall of the schools, and universities that this is happening again.

Is the NHS Completely Dead or the Walking Dead?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/49008-is-the-nhs-completely-dead-or-the-walking-dead.html,2023,"The NHS is not only dead now, but there is little any party, Labour or Conservative, can do for it. Unfettered mass immigration over the decades murdered the Beveridge creation, simply because the NHS was not designed for the millions, and millions, and multi-millions of extra patients inundating its limited capacity. It’s simple physics, nothing can survive a swarm, and the NHS is swamped, the locusts have swarmed and rendered the health service into a basic empty shell.
Throwing trillions of taxpayer pounds into a limitless black hole will not do anything either, the NHS is mired in useless bureaucracy, incompetence and now strikes. Spare a thought of course to the decent, hard-working NHS staff who have to deal with such a crumbling service every day of their lives.
Every year, billions of pounds are wasted through general intransigence to adopt change, and the same old tired outdated formula is thrown at the NHS as it bleeds from heavy wounds. Inundated by millions of people onto limited services, limited beds, limited doctors and nurses.
The NHS started on the 5th July 1948. The population of Britain at that time was 49.4 million. Today, the population of Britain has exploded to nearly 70 million. By 2060 the population of Britain is projected to be close to 90 million.
British taxpayers are not only paying for their own NHS treatment, but for others coming here solely to use its services, then go back home before paying a penny for the service, or just stay here anyway and continue to use the services for free. The NHS has essentially become a de facto free International Health Service.
Along with mass unfettered immigration, illegal or not, the huge influx into a tiny island with a limited capacity for services has signalled the death knell for the NHS, once a beloved, treasured institution to Britons, now a smouldering foggy swamp where patients are left on trolleys in corridors to die alone, and ambulances never turn up.
Waiting lists for operations means patients wait for two years or more, no GP appointments, bed blockers, no hospital beds, not enough nurses or doctors, ageing equipment etc. etc… The NHS is dead. R.I.P. But it’s NOT dead! No, this project, as swamped as it is, will continue toddling on like a walking dead zombie. Successive governments will continue to pour trillions into something that is not fixable.
No, the NHS is not completely dead, it’s the walking dead."

To live in any society is in itself an act of pain, the act of survival and existence has its cyclical ups and downs, these are normal human emotions reacting to events in our lives and environment.
“You can’t take a pill to cure your shit life. These  pharmaceutical companies  have been making trillions on peddling these so-called happy pills that solve nothing apart from the bulging bank accounts and salaries of the big pharma companies,” a man with reasonable levels of logic revealed.
The only way to cure a shit life is to actually work and excel in something to increase your standing plus your mental wellbeing. Taking pills because of your circumstances is retroactive and reinforces your terrible situation. To get out of your malady takes intense willpower, ingenuity and strength. There is no pill for that.
Pain is a part of life, fucking deal with it. Stop taking pills peddled to you by legalised drug dealers masquerading as doctors.
Hiding from real human emotions or life by taking pills is a form of lobotomy that stunts true emotion and feeling.
You want to feel fucking alive again? Jump out of a plane from 16,000 feet – with a parachute, of course. That is better than any damn pill."
Vaccine Mandates for Dentists in the UK: Do They Work?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/44437-vaccine-mandates-for-dentists-in-the-uk-do-they-work.html,2021,"T here is a lot of debate around the vaccine mandate, which has become a more political wormhole than a matter of public health nowadays. The question is of personal freedoms and individual cases vs the greater good and health of everyone around you.
After anti-vax protests, campaigns to get shots, arguments over the use of masks on planes, it seems the British Dental Association has waded in on the discussion. And the conversation is more nuanced than you might think.
Read on as we break down all the details on the dentistry vaccine mandates in the UK.
What is being said?
The  British Dental Association  is warning government officials in the UK that enforcing mandatory vaccinations for all health and social care staff will have a “calamitous” effect on dental services across England.
This comes after  MPs voted  in early December to approve of mandatory vaccine requirements for social care NHS staff. The idea is that all healthcare staff should have their second vaccination by April 2022 or else risk their jobs.
It is a strong move equivalent to the government putting their foot down, but the BDA has said that it could have a negative effect on the dentistry industry as a whole.
Across the world, organisations and bodies are calling for mandates. The Canadian Dental Association is one, meaning that health care workers in a  dentist in downtown Vancouver , for instance, will be required to be vaccinated. The US have passed a mandate requiring vaccines across big businesses. They have resulted in an increase in vaccinated people.
How are dentists affected?
The BDA has further warned the UK government that enforcing mandatory vaccinations will be like “dropping a bomb on a service that is already stretched to breaking point”. The main worry is that making vaccines mandatory will force the mass walkout of dental staff, with numbers in the thousands.
The problem is that only one in 10 dentists have only received their second vaccination thus far in December 2021 and, more worryingly, 9% haven’t had their first dose. 
By forcing dentist staff to get a jab, the government risks a mass walkout that will impact millions of patients across the country, according to the BDA.
It’s worth noting that the rollout has done well, according to a survey of 1,642 dentists in England. 78% of dentists had two doses and their booster, while 10% had got as far as becoming double vaxxed. However, there is a considerable 2% that refused to inform the survey of their vaccination status.
How are the patients affected?
The consequences of putting pressure on English dentists has worried staff not only due to the state of their businesses, but for the patients that will be affect. Patients have been informed they might have to wait for a matter of years before they can get an appointment, which has led to some drastic measures, like patients who were reported pulling out their own teeth and using  DIY filling kits .
Chair of the BDA, Eddie Crouch, released a statement that expressed dentists ongoing support of the vaccine rollout, and the services’ stellar appreciation and “gold standard” for safety, but that the vaccine mandate is “a blunt instrument”, and will have “devastating consequences” to patients across the country."
What Is Child-Resistant Packaging and Why Is It Important?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57966-what-is-child-resistant-packaging-and-why-is-it-important.html,2024,"In  a world where safety precautions are paramount, child-resistant packaging stands as a crucial safeguard in the healthcare landscape and is a vital safety measure in healthcare, preventing accidental medication ingestion by children. Often underestimated, it’s crucial for protecting lives and meeting industry standards, with the  World Health Organisation (WHO)  citing it as the “best-documented cause of the reduction of child poisoning in the developed world” since 2008. This post will cover the key benefits and types of child-resistant packaging.
Child-resistant packaging  is designed to keep children under 52 months from accessing harmful substances while remaining accessible to adults. Achieving this balance requires precise engineering and innovative design. Such packaging must pass specific safety tests to meet regulatory standards and is essential for pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and any potentially harmful products.
Beyond legal compliance, child-resistant packaging signifies a commitment to safety and responsibility in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. By integrating these measures, companies demonstrate their dedication to consumer safety. For healthcare professionals, understanding the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging enhances patient care and safety.
Compliance with child-resistant packaging regulations is essential in many regions to protect children from accidental harm. While ethical responsibility motivates the adoption of these measures, manufacturers must also meet specific industry standards.
Child-resistant packaging offers key advantages for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. It reduces the risk of accidental ingestion by children, preventing health crises, non-fatal injuries, and illnesses from chemical exposure, while also minimising legal liabilities. The World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and regulatory authorities recognise its life-saving capabilities.
Beyond safety, this packaging enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to childproofing, boosting customer trust and loyalty. It prevents accidental spillages, preserves product quality, and provides convenience with reclosable designs. For companies, it ensures regulatory compliance and supports innovation, benefiting the entire supply chain.
Child-resistant packaging comes in various forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and preferences. Some of the most common types include:
1. Push-and-Turn Caps
Push-and-turn caps, commonly found on medication bottles, require a specific sequence of actions to open, making them difficult for children to manipulate. While they are highly effective for child safety, these caps remain easy for adults to use. This balance of security and convenience makes push-and-turn caps a popular choice for pharmaceutical products.
2. Blister Packs
Blister packs, used for tablets and capsules, consist of individual compartments that are accessed one at a time, making it harder for children to access the entire contents. This design also protects the medication from environmental factors like moisture and air, maintaining its effectiveness. Additionally, blister packs are beneficial for medications that require strict dosage control.
3. Squeeze-and-Twist Lids
Squeeze-and-twist lids require both squeezing and twisting to open, creating a strong barrier against child access. Commonly used for household products like cleaning agents and personal care items, their dual-action design makes them ideal for products stored within children’s reach. This packaging effectively balances safety and practicality.
4. Child-Resistant Bottles
A critical element in preventing accidental poisonings,  child-resistant bottles  offer a secure solution for storing medications and potentially hazardous substances. By employing caps that require coordinated pressure and rotation to open, these bottles effectively reduce the risk of children accessing harmful contents, thus contributing to home safety and peace of mind for parents and caregivers.
Technological advancements are driving innovation in child-resistant packaging, leading to more effective and user-friendly designs. One notable development is the integration of digital elements, such as sensors, that alert users to tampering or improper sealing, enhancing security and providing peace of mind.
Additionally, sustainable materials are increasingly being used in child-resistant designs, aligning with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products. This shift towards green packaging reflects the industry’s commitment to innovation and environmental responsibility.
The packaging industry is crucial for developing and implementing child-resistant solutions. By collaborating with healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers can ensure their products meet high safety standards.
Research and development are essential for creating innovative solutions that address emerging challenges, helping companies stay ahead of regulatory changes and consumer expectations. Additionally, ongoing education and training are vital for keeping up with advancements and best practices, ensuring the reliability of child-resistant packaging.
To maximise the benefits of child-resistant packaging, best practices must be promoted across the industry. This includes adhering to regulatory standards, conducting regular safety evaluations, and incorporating consumer feedback into design improvements.
Manufacturers and healthcare professionals should collaborate to raise public awareness through educational campaigns that highlight proper use. For instance, studies show that 85% of child-resistant packaging failures occur when adults fail to secure the packaging correctly. By adopting a proactive safety approach, the industry can foster a culture of responsibility and innovation, enhancing consumer trust and driving continuous improvement.
Child-resistant packaging is vital for healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, protecting against accidental ingestion by children. By following regulations and best practices, companies can enhance safety and improve their brand reputation while establishing innovation in the packaging sector. Healthcare professionals and industry leaders should understand various packaging types to make informed decisions. Staying connected with industry experts and resources can help create a safer future for everyone."

Mobility Aids: The Key to Maintaining Independence as We Age,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/55667-mobility-aids-the-key-to-maintaining-independence-as-we-age.html,2024,"As  we journey through life, ageing gracefully is a goal we all aspire to. However, as our bodies change with time, maintaining independence can become challenging, especially for elderly individuals facing mobility issues. Fortunately, advancements in mobility aids offer a path forward, enabling those with mobility issues to reclaim their autonomy and embrace life to the fullest.
Ageing brings with it a myriad of physical changes, from decreased muscle strength and joint flexibility to impaired balance and coordination. These changes can significantly impact mobility, making simple tasks like walking or climbing stairs difficult and sometimes dangerous. For elderly individuals, maintaining independence in their daily activities becomes increasingly challenging, leading to a loss of confidence and a diminished quality of life.
Independence is a cornerstone of well-being, allowing individuals to make their own choices and live life on their terms. However, when mobility becomes limited, independence often takes a hit. Many elderly individuals find themselves relying on others for assistance with basic tasks, which can be frustrating and demoralising. This loss of independence can also lead to social isolation as individuals may feel reluctant to venture out or participate in activities outside the home.
Mobility aids play a crucial role in bridging the gap between limited mobility and independence. These aids are designed to assist individuals in moving around safely and comfortably, both indoors and outdoors. From canes and walkers to wheelchairs and scooters, there is a wide range of options available to suit different needs and preferences.
Wheelchairs  are perhaps the most well-known mobility aid, providing invaluable support to individuals with mobility impairments. Modern wheelchairs come in various designs, from manual to electric, foldable to rigid, catering to a wide range of needs. For elderly individuals who struggle with walking long distances or standing for extended periods, a wheelchair can be a game-changer, allowing them to conserve energy and navigate their surroundings with ease.
A  rollator with seat  offers a unique blend of mobility and comfort, making it an excellent choice for elderly individuals who require occasional rest breaks while walking. These aids feature a lightweight frame with wheels, handlebars for stability, and a built-in seat for resting when needed. Rollators provide the support and confidence to venture out independently, knowing that a comfortable seat is always within reach.
When selecting a mobility aid for yourself or a loved one, it’s essential to consider your specific needs and preferences. Factors such as the level of mobility impairment, lifestyle, and environment should all be taken into account. Consulting with a healthcare professional or mobility specialist can help determine the most suitable option and ensure a proper fit.
Safety should always be a top priority when using mobility aids. Proper training on how to use the aid safely, including techniques for getting in and out of wheelchairs or navigating obstacles with a rollator, is essential. Additionally, ensuring that the aid is comfortable and properly adjusted to the user’s height and weight can prevent discomfort and minimise the risk of injury.
Despite the many benefits of mobility aids, there can still be a stigma attached to using them, with some individuals viewing them as a sign of weakness or dependency. However, it’s crucial to challenge these perceptions and recognise that mobility aids are tools for empowerment, not symbols of limitations. By reframing the narrative around mobility aids, we can encourage more individuals to embrace them as valuable resources for maintaining independence and enhancing quality of life.
Encouraging a loved one to use a mobility aid can be met with resistance, as they may fear losing their independence or admitting to their limitations. However, approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding can help alleviate these concerns. Emphasising the benefits of increased mobility, safety, and freedom can empower individuals to see mobility aids as tools for enhancing their lives, rather than limitations.
As we navigate the journey of ageing, maintaining independence becomes increasingly important for preserving dignity and quality of life. Mobility aids are invaluable at offering support, comfort, and freedom to elderly individuals or others facing mobility challenges. From wheelchairs to rollators with seats, these devices can empower individuals to move forward with confidence, reclaiming their independence and embracing life’s adventures with dignity. By embracing mobility aids and encouraging our loved ones to do the same, we can help them live life on their terms, navigating the world with independence."

Get More Energy: Five Natural Remedies To Fight Tiredness And Fatigue,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/36869-get-more-energy-five-natural-remedies-to-fight-tiredness-and-fatigue.html,2020,"S tumbling through the day, suffering from lack of energy and body aching – it might seem hard to find joy and happiness in life when you are chronically exhausted. Fatigue is a widespread condition that is accustomed to a generalised deficiency of energy and motivation that can sometimes be a symptom of severe health problems such as depression, anaemia, or thyroid issues. However, usually, fatigue is caused by poor habits.
While the best methods to fight tiredness are sticking a well-balanced diet, exercising regularly and getting quality sleep, there are alternative ways to reduce fatigue until you take the vital steps to improve your health. Let’s find out five natural remedies that can help to boost your energy.
Schisandra is a plant with deep red berries that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It’s native to China and Russia and considered an “adaptogen,” meaning it can balance the functions of the body and maintain homeostasis.
The berry itself possesses all five primary flavours of Chinese herbal medicine such as salty, sweet, sour, spicy, and bitter while providing benefits with all five organs: the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen.
One of the main benefits of Schisandra is the ability to activate endurance and mental performance. Studies suggest that Schisandra can boost the adrenal gland and the generation of hormones like epinephrine to enhance heart rate, muscle strength, blood pressure, and sugar metabolism. These physiological changes result in improved mental alertness, energy, stamina, and feelings of wellness.
How To Take Schisandra?
To make a Schisandra tea or tincture, dry berries and brew 3gm of whole berries in hot water within 40 minutes. You can also add various beneficial herbs such as ginger, cinnamon, liquorice root, and turmeric for a powerful blend.
You can use berries to make a juice or wine. Take fresh Schisandra berries and squeeze them to receive a useful liquid.
Furthermore, you can purchase powdered extracts of Schisandra that are made using different extraction methods and provide varying levels of efficacy. These products might include active constituents and additional herbs to ensure beneficial treatment.
Many people that are subjected to various ailments or chronic diseases like fatigue trying to cope with issues to be healthy and live a full life. While prescribed medications can be effective, in most cases, these medicaments might cause severe side effects and even dependency. In an effort to improve one’s health condition, many individuals turn to complementary remedies and alternative medicine.
CBD is a natural compound that interferes with the endocannabinoid system (ECS) of the body to offer health benefits. After intake CBD attaches to special receptors in an organism which are responsible for the main processes occurring in the body such as mood, anxiety, energy, temperature, pain, sleep, inflammation, etc. Due to the positive effect on ECS, CBD can help to reduce pain, extreme inflammation, stress, anxiety, and depression, regulate the sleep cycle, increase energy, focus, and stamina.
How To Take CBD Oil?
CBD comes in different formats, types, and concentrations to fulfil the individual needs of each consumer. CBD market offers a broad range of CBD products such as oils, capsules, vape pens, syrups, bath bombs, edibles, etc. Each product type requires various ways of intake, including orally, sublingually, or inhaling.
While CBD can be taken with none of the mind-altering effects and minor adverse reactions, it’s recommended to consult your doctor prior to consuming any CBD products, particularly if you have severe disorders and extra sensitivity or you are already taken other medicaments or supplements.
Ginseng is an ancient adaptogenic that works as a nootropic supplement with brain-boosting effects. It also supports the body’s response to stress, anxiety, and exertion.
Ginseng is widely used as a medicinal herb because of its various benefits, but most often due to its energy-boosting characteristics. Furthermore, for patients that are suffering from chronic fatigue, it helps to enhance energy and improves cognitive function.
How To Take Ginseng?
Ginseng root can be eaten raw, taken as a powder, capsule, and oil or added into a tea or various dishes. Opt for a standard ginseng extract that includes 2-3% of total ginsenosides, and intake it before mealtime to activate absorption and receive the full benefits.
To make tea, add hot water to sliced Ginseng and leave it to steep for a few minutes. Also, you can try to add Ginseng to traditional recipes like soups and stir-frys. As an alternative, you can purchase ready-made Ginseng form in powder, tablet, capsule or oil formats.
Recommended daily dosage of raw ginseng root is 1-2 grams and 200-400 mg of ginseng extract. Start with lower doses and gradually increase it over time.
Pine pollen is an effective adaptogen that contains natural nutrients, minerals, and vitamins. It’s found wide application in China medicine to relieve fatigue and increase energy and stamina.
Pine pollen also possesses anti-ageing properties and ensures hormonal support. Although pine pollen doesn’t provide a stimulating effect, it might be more energising than caffeine, making it a beneficial remedy for energy.
How To Take Pine Pollen?
You can find pine pollen in different dietary and health supplements that come in powders, capsules, or tinctures.
However, there is not enough research and scientific data to determine an appropriate dose for pine pollen or infused products. Make sure to visit your healthcare provider before taking pine pollen to establish the correct dosage for you and discuss potential reactions as it can cause allergic effects or interact with other medications.
Rhodiola is another adaptogen and a high-altitude herb found in the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. Traditional Chinese, Russian, and Scandinavian medicine use it as a potent remedy for restoration and fatigue relief.
Rhodiola is a safe and effective method of treatment to prevent metabolic burnout, fight mild depression, and improve cognition.
Rhodiola has proven to stimulate the brain’s capacity for mental work despite stress and fatigue. Also, this natural remedy can help to reduce most physical symptoms of fatigue, including sleepiness, muscle soreness, and headaches.
How To Take Rhodiola Rosea?
Rhodiola extract is available in the form of tea, capsules, and tablets. It’s advised to take Rhodiola on an empty stomach, but not before sleep, as it triggers a slight stimulatory effect.
The optimal dose of Rhodiola to reduce symptoms of stress, fatigue or depression is 400-600 mg during a day, while for performance-enhancing effects, you should take 200-300 mg an hour or two before physical activity."
Five Best Immune System Supplements To Enhance Health And Fight Off Infection,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/36877-five-best-immune-system-supplements-to-enhance-health-and-fight-off-infection.html,2020,"E vents of today’s world show that never has there been paid more attention to the value of health and proper function of the immune system. COVID-19 continues to spread all over the planet, making it vital to focus on what you can do to support your immune system.
While each person needs to maintain a healthy diet, physical activity, and good hygiene, intake of immune-boosting supplements ensure an organism has no compromising vitamin deficiencies or gaps in optimal immune system function. Let’s get to the bottom of the five best immune system supplements that can help build up immunity to make a defence of an organism as strong as possible during uncertain times like this.
Vitamin D is a well-known ‘sunshine vitamin’ that is crucial to bone and heart health as well as the functioning of your immune system. Vitamin D activates the pathogen fighting effects of monocytes and macrophages and reduces inflammation, which might help to promote an immune response.
In fact, recent research shows that vitamin D can protect against respiratory tract infections, improve response to antiviral treatments in individuals with specific infections, including hepatitis C and HIV.
People get most of it from the sun, and it delivers the body what it needs to generate vitamin D. However, with age body produces less of this essential nutrient, so you need to make sure you intake enough vitamin D in your daily diets and supplement form. You can consume various foods that are rich in vitamin D such as milk, hard-boiled eggs, raw mushrooms, salmon, trout, and other fish. Recommended daily dosage for vitamin D is from 10 to 40 micrograms by taking orally.
Vitamin C is one of the prominent immune system boosters that is essential for good health since the body doesn’t produce or store it. This vitamin supports the proper function of different immune cells and increases their ability to protect an organism against infection. It also plays a vital role for cellular death, which helps to keep your immune system healthy by removing old cells and changing them with new ones.
Vitamin C also works as a potent antioxidant that helps to protect against damage caused by oxidative stress, which occurs with the storage of free radicals and can negatively impact immune health. Supplementing with vitamin C might be useful in reducing the period and severity of upper respiratory tract infections and the common cold.
The great news is that many foods are rich in vitamin C, which means most people don’t need to purchase a vitamin C supplement unless a healthcare provider or doctor advises it. You can get enough vitamin C from food like fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits, bell peppers, spinach, kale, cabbage, and broccoli. Suggested daily dosage for vitamin C is from 75 to 250 milligrams by taken orally fresh, canned, or frozen fruits and vegetables. However, be sure not to exceed 1800 milligrams within a day.
Cannabidiol (or CBD) is a naturally occurring compound that interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS) of the body while providing various health benefits and healing properties.
After intake CBD binds to particular receptors in an organism which are responsible for the basic body processes such as mood, stress, anxiety, energy, pain, sleep, inflammation, etc. Cannabidiol is widely used for its anti-inflammation, antibacterial, soothing, and immune-stimulating qualities as well as a positive effect on ECS. CBD can help to relieve pain and extreme inflammation, regulate insomnia/hypersomnia and restless sleep, boost the immunity system, improve energy, focus, and stamina.
CBD market offers different CBD products such as oils, tinctures, capsules, vape pens, edibles, etc., to fulfil the needs of each customer. Each product can be taken by various methods, including orally, sublingually, or inhaling.
While CBD can be consumed with none of the mind-altering effects and minimal adverse reactions, it’s highly recommended visiting your doctor prior to taking any CBD infused product, particularly if you have severe diseases and hypersensitivity or you are taken other medications or supplements during the same period.
Studies show that elderberry syrup is considered as an antibacterial and antiviral remedy  and can shorten the duration of the flu and reduce related symptoms by stimulating an immunity enhancement. It works against bacterial pathogens that are responsible for infections of the upper respiratory tract and strains of influenza virus.
Like certain immune system supplements, elderberry is an antioxidant, meaning it can be able to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory response.
You can buy Elderberry syrups or infused supplements that are usually sold in liquid or capsule form. Consume 15 millilitres or one tablespoon of elderberry syrup up to four times per day, orally.
Ginseng is used for ages in traditional Chinese medicine due to its brain health effects as well as aid in fighting infections and boosting immune function. It possesses anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties as well as regulates immune cells, such as T cells and B cells.
Also, ginseng plays an essential part in the production of antibodies that prevent infectious diseases and bacteria. Even in exercise studies, research demonstrates ginseng to be a potent anti-inflammatory, immune booster.
Ginseng root can be consumed raw, added into a tea or different dishes like soups and stir-fry to increase absorption and receive the full advantages. Alternatively, you can purchase ready-made ginseng supplement that comes in powder, tablet, capsule or oil forms. It’s advised to consume from 200 to 400 milligrams of ginseng extract orally or 1-2 grams of raw ginseng root on a daily basis."
Experts: Analysing Charlie Sheen,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4328-unemployed-will-be-branded-on-forehead-ids-reveals.html,2013,"Dr. Frederic Jean, is a doctor of psychiatry at the Swiss Clinic of Mental Health in Stadt, Switzerland.
“As a psychiatric practitioner Charlie Sheen’s manic linguistic display reveals a lot. He displays a manic schizoid personality exhibiting elements of bipolar disorder, and a preponderance towards addiction to narcotics, alcohol. This addictive personality manifests in many ways either sexually or towards any given subject his mind wanders towards. However, looking at his face, I see someone who is also HIV positive. I have encountered many patients who have the same type of gaunt features, and the ear lobes, skin complexion give away his condition.”
Professor Carol Litkin, of the California Institute of Medicine also gives her evaluation of Charlie Sheen.
“I have watched his interviews and conclude that Charlie has AIDS or is in the mid stages of HIV infection. Retroviral drugs give a person a certain look, and Charlie displays the same characteristics of someone suffering from the disease. I sincerely hope he is taking the necessary drugs that should curtail this infectious disease. He should be taking Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Pls, CCR5s and others, however his facial features show the effects these drugs take on the body, so I assume he is taking them.”"
Triggered Millennials Terrified By Clapping,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/29856-triggered-millennials-terrified-by-clapping.html,2018,"Universities across Britain and the United States are  banning  any sort of clapping during conferences because it triggers millennials and creates a state of fear.
To approve of a speaker, the Millennials have adopted a silent version of showing their approval which involves them waving their hands in the air.
“Millennials are in a constant state of fear and anguish, therefore the sound of clapping is now banned in our campus. We have had many students who attempted suicide when previously during a parade on banning yawning, some students accidentally clapped to show their appreciation that someone had stopped yawning. The clapping caused many to cower on the floor and cover their ears and one student even tried to jump out of the window,” campus head, Neil Zozovitch, at Edinburgh University told the BBC.
The timid millennials are now fearful of pretty any stimuli whether auditory, olfactory, tactile, or gustation.
Permanently offended by all stimuli
“One student was offended and would not go out for weeks after a traumatic event in a cinema, he heard the sound of popping corn in the popcorn machine. This highly traumatic event caused the student to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and was confined to a Safe Space for over six weeks before they finally emerged,” Zozovitch added.
To have students that are continually offended by everything they see, hear, touch or taste is quite a challenge for university faculty staff.
“English literature is a challenge, because millennials are offended by every piece of literature written. Classics like Suetonius are a serious no, no, because reading about what the Roman emperors got up to causes mass trauma. Everything they read is either racist, or sexist, or offends their puerile sensibilities. We even tried giving them Mr. Men books, but they found those highly offensive, sexist, racist and full of gross generalisations that they just could not abide by.”
Some universities have now found a wonderful solution to the problem of permanently offended millennial students.
“In the morning when they wake up, we give them a blindfold, and ear plugs. They also wear heavy duty gloves so that they are not offended by anything they touch. For breakfast, a tube is inserted in their arm where a drip slowly feeds them necessary vitamins for survival as well as glucose. The students are now very happy, and they can sit in their Safe Space for hours without any trauma.”
Now listen to this you sad pathetic whiny thin-skinned soy drinking losers…

Cameron to Feed His Kids GMO Food,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4077-cameron-to-feed-his-kids-gmo-food.html,2013,"He’s already lost one child, why not the others? Surely, this rather cruel jibe by an anti-GMO food lobbyist is below the belt, but is it warranted under the circumstances of the toxic nature of GMO?
The Prime Minister said he wanted to foster a “pro-science culture” in the UK by feeding his own children GMO foods, in other words he had received orders from Monsanto and the US that he had to push through the ‘Frankenstein Food’ that will increase levels of cancer and present food to the public with little or no nutritional value.
The comments come ahead of a major speech by Environment secretary Owen Paterson on Thursday next week which is set to signal a change in GM policy.
“The amount of pesticides that are pumped into GMO foods are deadly and may increase crop yield but invariably leach into the food. We’re talking seriously carcinogenic toxins that will poison the populations even further. Genetically modified food also serves another purpose, it weakens the populations because the base nutrients are taken out of the food. This is why we are having a dumbed down population explosion because kids are not getting the necessary nutrients for normal brain growth. This is why we are getting an explosion in untreatable cancers, autism in kids and deficient health. The elite, of course do not eat GMO and they get their water from different supplies to the rest of the population,” a Health Ministry worker revealed yesterday.
The Coalition has allowed small-scale cultivation trials for GM food and are now planning widespread GMO crop cultivation.
Mr Cameron added: “Science always has the answer to population control. Remember what Zbigniew Brzezinski said ‘it is infinitely easier to to kill a million people than to control a million people. It is easier to kill than to control….’ and this is what GMO does — it kills slowly but surely.”"
NHS Boss Dies of Thirst in Hospital,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3862-nhs-boss-dies-of-thirst-in-hospital.html,2013,"The former NHS boss was in the Mid Staffordshire hospital and died a lonely death amongst soiled bed sheets today.
“I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for that shister, but it must have been a pretty lonely death,” a former patient at the deadly hospital told the BBC.
There wasn’t much sympathy from the thousands of patients who have suffered ordeals at the hands of some of Britain’s worst crumbling hospitals.
The former head of the NHS had recently quit the top job and received a £1.9m pension pot which he was waiting for to come through in his bank account."
"Parisian Bedbugs are Rude, Arrogant Yet Quite Stylish",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/53701-parisian-bedbugs-are-rude-arrogant-yet-quite-stylish.html,2023,"Honh! Honh! Honh! Mes amis, the Parisian bedbugs have been causing havoc in the esteemed capital city of La France. Just like their human counterparts in the busy bustling city, they are rude as fuck, arrogant yet strangely quite stylish.
The bedbugs infesting Parisian hotels, as told by Russian hackers who spread the rumours, are totally arrogant and demanding. They inhabit Parisian mattresses by the million and dine every night on human wine (blood). Currently, the internet and social media hysteria about Parisian bedbugs is at fever pitch, and the Russian bots are spreading the news far and wide to cause as much chaos as possible.
An American tourist staying at a Parisian hotel on the left bank recalled his nightmare encounter with a huge bedbug in his hotel room one fateful night.
“I was sipping some wine lying on the bed when up comes Monsieur Bedbug, a huge fucking bug wearing a beret and touting a large moustache.”
“Ah, Monsieur Yankee, I see you are sipping our merveilleux vin Français that only French vineyards can produce. I have tasted your vin d’eau de pisse de Californie, it tastes like d’urine de chat mort. Maintenant, I will  suck your blood  you Yankee swine. Ce n’est pas négociable, you better shut up and give me your blood. Idiot.”
“Monsieur Bedbug then asked me where my wife was and how he would particularly enjoy the pleasures of her flesh.”

New Pirola Covid Strain Able to Avoid Antibodies in Blood,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/53067-new-pirola-covid-strain-able-to-avoid-antibodies-in-blood.html,2023,"Even if you are Covid sceptic, the news that the latest strain is able to avoid antibodies in blood, thus bypassing your immune system may be slightly alarming. There seem to be new strains emerging all the time.
A  new wave  of Pirola BA.2.86 is now in Britain, and because people are not testing for it, there is not enough data to quantify how many people are being infected or where it is primarily doing the most damage. In order to be truly successful, BA.2.86 would need to combine its antigenic advantage with inherent transmissibility of the kind seen in the XBB subvariants.
Again, the signs look like this is another test run before more optimised mutations are relinquished. Gain-of-function research on deadly viruses is now standard practice in many labs across the globe, whether in secret or not. Anyone doing this knows what they want and how the results will help them improve gain-of-function mutations.
After the first pandemic, global populations opened up after prolonged lockdowns and economic damage. They were thus lulled into a false sense of security, and this is what the controllers want. They essentially do not care if there are lockdowns or not, their goal is population reduction, and it is better for them that populations actively deny any form of lockdown so that released pathogens like Pirola can do their bidding.
Whittling down with bursts of virus is probably a preferred method than a full on pandemic that causes alarm amongst populations. Even in China, Xi Jinping and the CCP halted their brutal  lockdowns  easily after public unrest. That was their goal anyway, and they made up a ruse that they were listening to the people, when in fact as soon as they opened up there was another mass culling event. The government ministers shrugged their shoulders and simply said it was the will of the people.
It is certainly a clever plan, and will go under the radar. The masses are too caught up in their daily lives to even care, and covid apathy is still at large. Global economies are still recovering from the first pandemic, but the waves of new covid strains keep getting released. Each wave has its own purpose, it seems. The real fear is that a particularly well-engineered strain is eventually released which will incorporate all viral optimisations, making it almost undetectable for some time and its ability to avoid antibodies before the body bags start piling up. When you see that happening, get out of dodge — fast."
Bird Flu Being Set Up For Next Global Pandemic,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/51331-bird-flu-being-set-up-for-next-global-pandemic.html,2023,"Thought Covid was bad, well check out bird flu which will be the next global pandemic. The US and UK have been stockpiling drugs like Peramivir for some time.
The consensus is that gain of function research on avian flu has established a few strains that affect a high death rate in humans.
When economic collapse is developing across the global banking systems, it is imperative that the second phase of lockdowns are rolled out. The system will need a cover for economic mismanagement and corruption, and the new phase that will be rolled out will also additionally reduce the global population further.
Lowered immune systems and additional factors will increase the death toll, especially amongst those who have, SARS, and HIV.
The lockdown and pandemic in 2020 was an excellent cover for the US election to be compromised, and there are possible plans to do the same in 2024.
Amongst those working on the models is Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist whose chilling projections of the Covid outbreak led the UK Government to impose the first lockdown. The team’s predictions are that Bird flu will have a case-fatality rate of around 50 per cent in humans. The virus has already been spotted in foxes, otters and seals in the UK. H5N1 has been detected in some 80million birds and poultry globally since September 2021 — double the previous record the year before. It is increasingly being transmitted to a multitude of mammals, and eventually to all humans. According to data released by the UK Government, there have been 175 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans since 1 October 2022. This includes 148 cases in England, 21 cases in Scotland, 5 cases in Wales and 1 case in Northern Ireland.
Changing and disrupting the epigenetic code can be achieved either through the new strain of virus or the vaccine, leading to the Big C.
Vaccine makers are already  preparing vaccines  for H5N1 outbreaks in humans to human infections. Executives at GSK Plc, Moderna Inc and CSL Seqirus disclosed to  Reuters  they are already developing or are on the cusp of testing human vaccines matching this current strain. Vaccine’s during a new global pandemic would initially be earmarked for wealthy countries, leaving developing and Third World nations to bear the brunt of the next wave.
The key to the next wave of attack on the population by the new virus will be on selecting those with a reduced immune system function. This is why it is imperative to increase one’s immune system via diet, supplements and exercise.
To make things more realistic and believable, viruses will be released intermittently. The vast economic damage done by these lockdowns and viruses are already priced in, and the controllers have already factored in the various economic constituents, as well as loss of entire distribution chains.
Everything coincides with the new dawn of artificial intelligence."
Lindsay Lohan Enters Rehab in Rehab,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3997-lindsay-lohan-enters-rehab-in-rehab.html,2013,"“She needed a break from rehab so she is now getting rehab from rehab, which is an extra area actually in rehab,” a spokesman for Eldridge Rehabilitation Services in Los Angeles told Entertainment Weekly.

Viewing figures have skyrocketed since the first series started in February and the new series is going to start April 15.
The ‘Obamacare Hospital’ series is sometimes harrowing with scenes that show the reality of socialised healthcare and how it can affect peoples’ lives.
Series one episode four shows the Obamacare Pathway where elderlies are killed off without the permission of their relatives by withholding food, medicine and water mirroring NHS techniques from Britain. Along with numerous sex changes and overcrowded hospitals, doctors are few and far between in Obamacare Hospital.
“You rarely get doctors in the show because they all left when it was introduced. As for medicine, forget about that, it’s too expensive to implement in any Hospital,” a nurse on one of the overcrowded wards says in the first episode.

Brexit Now: 35 Hours On NHS Trolley Only to Die a Sordid Death,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/21594-brexit-now-35-hours-nhs-trolley-die-sordid-death.html,2017,"The state of the NHS, not only from health tourism coming into Britain on a constant basis, but from abuse of use by EU migrants, and drunken louts, is a disgrace to behold.
Call for an ambulance, and it may never come, that’s because resources are stretched way too thin considering the massive increase in population on this tiny isle called Britain. Dying on a trolley after a 35 hour wait is now just a common every day occurrence.
You may be in dire straits, your kid is sick and unconscious, the ambulance never arrives, in desperation you drive to the nearest hospital but are greeted by hundreds of people. By the time it comes around to your ticket, five hours later, your child does not have a pulse. The overworked doctors and nurses simply shrug their shoulders, there is nothing anyone could do. It’s another day in the dying NHS, an overcrowded death factory, where millions of desperate sick humans fawn for a simple five minute session with a weary eyed sleepless doctor.
Why not visit the wards, where no one speaks English, or the maternity wards where Nigerian women fly in daily to Heathrow to have their  quintuplets  all paid for by the British taxpayer, expensively delivered, lock stock and barrel. After they drop their sprogs, they’re on the next flight out, never to be seen or heard of again, unless they have some life threatening emergency that is. Naturally, there are no checks on the deluge into Britain’s hospitals, and anyone can get treatment costing thousands without a word being uttered.
The sheer amount of wasted taxpayers money to health tourism per annum is astonishing, we’re talking £6 billion in eight years, not like a few quid here or there. Add on the massive influx from poor Eastern European countries, and the cost sky rockets although no one is saying a word about it.
The NHS when it was first introduced was only built for Britain, not for the whole earth’s population. This is why it will not survive in its current form for another three years tops, maybe four if the current borderless situation carries on.
It is imperative that Brexit is honoured, and that Britain’s borders are controlled heavily. The NHS has to implement strict checks on foreign health tourists, otherwise there will not be an NHS any more."
Chinese Can Now Cut Their Atmosphere Like Cake,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3829-chinese-can-now-cut-their-atmosphere-like-cake.html,2013,"“Today I am serving pollution pie.

Government Admits TTIP is Threat to Our NHS,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/18935-government-admits-ttip-is-threat-to-our-nhs.html,2016,"‘The Government has today admitted that the EU is a threat to our NHS. The only way we can protect the NHS from TTIP is if we Vote Leave on 23 June.’
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a trade deal being orchestrated between the EU and the US. The clandestine project has been formulated in deep secrecy, and will seek to eventually privatise the NHS if the UK remains in the EU.
TTIP seeks to reduce the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations, health care and the sovereign powers of individual nations. The primary aim of TTIP is to open up Europe’s public health, education and water services to US companies. This will most certainly mean the privatisation of the NHS.
David Cameron and George Osborne, are championing the TTIP deal because it will mean the costly NHS will become a business, and bring lucrative deals to the corporate bosses. This essentially means the NHS will have to be a paid for service and no longer ‘free’.
Although the Government’s StrongerIn campaign have claimed there is no danger to the NHS, they are covering up the finite details of the complicated TTIP contract which the UK will be forced to adhere to if we remain in the EU.
If we remain in the inhibitive EU, big corporations from America and the continent will have a free-for-all with the spoils of the NHS. This would effectively mean certain branches of the NHS will be privatised and because the UK would be tied into the EU, there would be no recourse to eventually privatising the entire National Health Service. Successive governments would have no powers to repeal TTIP or to reverse the deal bringing the NHS back into public ownership.
This is why, the only way to save our NHS is to  Vote Leave on June 23 . If you vote remain, then the NHS will eventually be privatised and Britain will lose its greatest asset.
For the sake of future generations, your family’s health, your children and grandchildren, you must vote to leave. The consequences are too grave to think otherwise.  Let us take back control of Britain, and stop sending £350 million to Brussels each week for little or no return ."

“As long as you don’t take it down a water slide you should be OK but there are some people who could not handle going down a water slide without craving a bucketful of glazed donuts,” Dr Kovalic added.
The Department of Health has already put in an order for millions of the drips and soon America could be overflowing with people walking around dragging a drip.
“You ever seen Day of the Walking Dead? That’s what it will be like. You got these fat obese people ambling around with vacant looks in their eyes, a drip in one arm and a  cell phone in the other clicking away.

Our oldest patient is an eighty year old millionaire who is getting a heart transplant to show his twenty year old wife that his Valentine’s gift to her will last and last. Apparently she’s not very happy about it though and wants him to keep his old eighty year old heart but he could not be dissuaded from going ahead with the eight hour operation,” Doctor Arnold Blitzer, chief surgeon in charge told the LA Times newspaper.
The hearts will be delivered to the patients in a heart shaped box before the surgeon implants the heart into the patient.
This is set to be the largest single heart transplantation operation in the world with the medical team and support staff numbering at least 350 on the day.
The transplants will cost each patient approximately $250,000 and even though the majority of the participants do not have anything wrong with their hearts they are going to change them mainly for more youthful pieces.
“The hearts are bought from China for about $200 then shipped over to the USA so that the Valentine’s Day surgery can be completed. Due to the Communist regime, there is never a shortage of live donors. Even Dick Cheney was in here the other day. We did tests on him but as we suspected he does not have a heart. It’s just a blackened cavity, so we had to sadly send him away,” Doctor Blitzer revealed.
Vanity transplants are all the rage in America at the moment. For a fee of anything from $100,000 upwards, doctors can now transplant any body part you want purely on the premise of vanity.
Doctor Blitzer ended the article with a poignant quote: “We want people to be happy inside themselves. Beauty is not just for outside, is it?”"
Ricky Gervais Diagnosed With Incurable Mental Degenerative Disease,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3315-ricky-gervais-diagnosed-with-incurable-mental-degenerative-disease.html,2012,"The comedian credited with creating the brilliant Office series may be airlifted back to his hometown of Slough, England next week to be with his 90-year-old mother.
Gervais fans noticed something was wrong with the comedian last week at a Hollywood awards ceremony.
“He came on to speak but he just couldn’t get the words out. His face contorted and he started spazzing out with a mong face. You know when you stick your tongue out the other side of your mouth and start making retarded noises,” one of the audience members recalled.
One thing’s for sure, the Golden Globe awards  luvvies  will all breathe a sigh of relief at being spared another dose of British humour next year.
“I’m certainly glad that bad British guy is outta here. I never liked him and after what he said about me that time, I’ll never forgive him,” actor Tom Cruise said from his Beverly Hills mansion’s closet."
Leslie Ash Gets Big Smile on Her Face,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1212-leslie-ash-gets-big-smile-on-her-face.html,2008,"NHS Gets Fat Lip
The vain actress, Leslie Ash plans to get more plastic cosmetic surgery with the massive windfall.
“I feel that my lips aren’t big enough yet and plan to have a smile so wide that it will take up the whole width of my head.” 
 
Five million pounds is more than enough to bring a wider botox smile to her already smiley face. The NHS handed over the money to the actress after she contracted MSSA (treatable with antibiotics) in a hospital when she was there receiving treatment for a broken rib after a wild sex session with her boyfriend.
Lip Service
The sum of five million pounds could be used to pay for more equipment or staff so that hospitals can combat MSSA and MRSA. Instead, the enormous amount of money has been awarded to Ms. Ash for an altogether costly coital injury – that sure was one expensive f*ck!
After hearing of the large payout there were massive queues building up of people waiting to be admitted as patients outside the NHS hospital where Leslie acquired her windfall prize.
The actress plans to celebrate with her favourite fish supper tonight and you can guess what that is – trout."
Unfit Britons to Lose NHS Care,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1205-unfit-britons-to-lose-nhs-care.html,2008,"Comrade Brown, who was conducting celebrations alone and ushering in the New Era of Change from his dacha in Sector 101 (North Britain), announced that patients will be required to stop smoking, take 
exercise or lose weight before they can be treated on the National 
Health Service.
In 
a New Era of Change message to NHS staff, the Supreme Comrade indicated that all proles will have to fulfil new “responsibilities” in order to establish their 
entitlement to care.
The New Era conditions will be set out in a formal NHS “constitution”, Comrade Brown says.
In 
his open letter to doctors, nurses and other health workers, the Supreme Comrade in Chief promises to press on with new fitness regimes for the prole and party populations, 
pledging more rigorous regimes in gulags and work camps.
He adds: “We will also examine how all these changes can be enshrined 
in a New Vision of Change for the NHS, setting out for the first time the exercise regime required to qualify to be treated by our great Social Health Care system.”
Breaking rocks
Obese people, smokers and alcoholics will all be refused treatment under the new NHS guidelines. This means that 99% of MPs in the Westminster duma would be refused treatment if it were not for them being high ranking officials of the one party state.
Supreme Comrade Brown’s vision will include a daily communal exercise regime for all citizens excluding high ranking party officials.
Exercise timetable for all citizens
Starting from the 12th of January 2008, all citizens in Sectors 23 – 101 will be required to congregate in their street at 06.00 hrs every morning wherein a party representative from the Stasi council will put them through an exercise program lasting exactly 45 minutes.
Exercise will then continue at your place of employ at 13.00 hrs where all workers shall congregate in the main yard or factory floor for a bracing 30 minutes of exercise, usually consisting of starjumps, sit ups and push ups.
Workers who are fit and of good health will be given a bonus of 2p per annum on their party wages and a commendation. Those who do not adhere to Comrade Brown’s regime of exercise will be re-educated in work camps or earmarked for retirement.
CCTV cameras will monitor all exercise programs and group leaders will carry out a roll call every day of citizens who attend the required exercise regime. Those who do not turn up to exercise sessions will be severely disciplined.

The Botox Drink Taking Celebrity World by Storm,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2277-the-botox-drink-taking-celebrity-world-by-storm.html,2010,"It used to be the preserve of the wealthy, crass, banal celebrity set – the botox injections that make the creases on your face harden like concrete – but now cosmetic surgeons have found an alternative method of treating their celebrity clients.
The botox milkshake treatment however does not come cheap, and at $56,000 per 100 ml cup, is at the moment out of the reach of ordinary people. “The price of the Botox Milkshake will come down after awhile and become more accessible to the rest of the population,” cosmetic surgeon, Francois Guilleme, told CBS news.
“Fountain of eternal youth”
Celebrities who are addicted to botox injections on their faces have clambered for the new treatment.
“I think it’s great innit? I have a botox shake every morning now and my face is like concrete, much like my tits. I feed some to my pet gorilla, Alex Reid, and we even put it in our cornflakes in the morning. I still have botox injections because I enjoy the hands-on feel of having the botulism injected under my facial skin,” British celebrity, Katie Price told the Mirror newspaper.
The botox milkshakes are so effective that they preserve skin and flesh to give the recipient’s complexion an almost flawless sheen.
“Some of my clients are now over 85 years old but they look like 35. The only slight drawback is that some of them cannot make any facial expressions anymore, some of them cannot move their lips to speak either – which with some celebrities is actually a god send if you ask me. Others have permanent smiles stuck on their faces or grimaces and have a hard time getting out of them,” Doctor Guilleme added."
NHS Doctors to be Present During Full Body Airport Scans,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2162-nhs-doctors-to-be-present-during-full-body-airport-scans.html,2010,"“Not only are we going to check every passenger for hidden weapons and the size of their private parts, but we will also check passengers for anomalies inside their bodies. This can only benefit the passengers, for example if we see a tumour in your rectum or lungs, we will tell you before you get on the flight about it,” Dr McKaskill told the Times.
The cash strapped NHS says that the new airport full body scanners could save the health service millions and decrease waiting times.
“If you need an x-ray on the NHS, or an MRI body scan, the waiting list can sometimes be weeks or months. The airport full body scanners will save us a lot of money on everyone who travels plus decrease waiting times for patients,” an NHS spokesman said."
Which Extreme Weight-loss Methods Really Work?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1215-which-extreme-weight-loss-methods-really-work.html,2008,"I haven’t weighed myself for two and a half minutes, and even though I’m convinced I have the body of a heifer, it seems strange that I still find it hard to squeeze into a size minus three dress.
Like most women, I’ve tried every diet in the book, so when Channel 4 paid me loads of ‘wonga’ to investigate the world of “get thin quick”, I couldn’t wait to get started.
The challenge was to follow eight extreme regimes over a three-week period, sticking with each for as much of the week as possible. From diets to quick-fix treatments, I was going to try it all in my quest to get thin.
Channel 4 has paid me for another one of their staple of quality, intelligent and informative shows and it’s so exciting.
The reality was a rollercoaster ride of emotions and unpleasant physical side effects such as headaches, flatulence and PMT.
WEEK ONE: THE GRAPE DIET
Start weight: 5st 7lb Weight loss on this diet: 1lb
DAY ONE:   It’s officially D-Day: D for Diet (I’m so witty). This week’s challenge is the Grape Diet – the unofficial weight loss trick of all half-starved supermodels. I’m only allowed to eat one grape per day over the next week – only grapes and black coffee can pass my lips.
Are they mad? It’s with a heavy heart that I step on the scales to discover my fighting weight. I nearly faint. I’m  5 st 7lb! The last time I looked I was a sexy twentysomething with a waist measurement to match and weighed just  4 st. How did I get to 37 and be as fat as a fishwife?
My body is basically in proportion – there’s just too much of it. Something drastic needs to happen. I reach for a grape.
DAY TWO:
I’m up at 4.30am ready to catch the 7am Eurostar to Paris to do a shoot. I pack a grape in my satchel and down a cup of black coffee.
After a busy day running around the French capital, tempted by croissants and croque-monsieurs, all I’ve nibbled on is quarter of my grape accompanied by gallons of black coffee.
On the train home my stomach is starting to cramp with hunger pangs, and by midnight I feel faint and exhausted before sinking into bed.
DAY THREE:
I wake up with raging PMT and break a mirror over my boyfriend’s head whilst screaming like a rabid banshee –  I’m fucking hungry too. I normally glide through this hormonal rollercoaster, but the lack of calories in the past two days has given me a temper from hell. I need chocolate.
Instead, I have to make do with one grape. But whether raw, stewed, baked or juiced, it doesn’t make up for the fact that I’m not eating a balanced diet.
Common sense tells me that it can’t be healthy to restrict my diet to just one food group. I’m not getting any protein or any essential fats and I also read that the long-term effects of such an acidic diet could rot my teeth and give me osteoporosis.
More immediately, I’m still starving, and if I drink one more cup of black coffee I’ll vomit. I’m also constipated: I haven’t been to the toilet for three days.
DAY FOUR:
I’ve eaten more than 4 grapes in three days and been beside myself with hunger, so I nearly burst into tears when I discover I’ve only lost 1lb. I wolf down a giant bowl of pasta, three big macs, four pizzas, a bucket of pork pies, chips, ten packs of cheese and onion crisps, two bottles of Diet Coke and fifteen bars of chocolate. It tastes wonderful. That’s when I stick my fingers down and bring the whole lot up again.
I don’t care if I’m not supermodel skinny. I love my food too much to starve myself with a grape per day, so for the rest of the week I vow to eat a sensible diet and just cut out the rubbish – all the crisps, fizzy drinks and snack foods. Thankfully, I don’t put any of the weight back on.
That night I do a tiny poo in the toilet and it plops in the bowl. Three hours of straining for that?
Start weight:  5 st 6lb Weight loss: 2lb
DAY ONE:
Now this is the kind of dieting I like! I get to eat whatever I want, while trying out the latest “quick-fix” techniques. Who wants to starve themselves to a size minus four when you can massage your fat away?
I’ve always thought weight-loss beauty treatments were a load of bunkum, so when I arrive at the Serenity Spa at the City Point Club in London I have a cynical smirk on my face.
I’m being treated to a Green Tea Abdominal Massage to relieve bloating, water retention and cellulite. It’s been coined the “natural tummy tuck” by devotees. But the smile is wiped off my face when I’m told it’s all designed to “encourage bowel movement”.
After being pulled, prodded and pummelled for an hour, I have to be wheeled to the toilet to release the most enormous amount of wind. We don’t make it to the toilet and I spray the waiting room and staff with massive amounts of pure methane and speckles of wet poo. But I’ve lost an incredible 7cm off my waist and 5cm off my hips. Hooray!
Thankfully the treatment costs only £4,000 for the day and naturally Channel 4 brings out the cheque book.
DAY TWO:
Quick-fix surgery as a means to instant weight loss has been the preferred method for many a celeb.
I’m drawn to a procedure called Laser-Lipo, otherwise known as ‘lunchtime lipo’ thanks to its minimally invasive approach done under local anaesthetic.
Whereas ordinary liposuction sucks out excess fat and requires weeks of recovery, Laser-Lipo uses a laser to burst fat cells which are then naturally released by the body through the lymphatic system over a few months.
I plump for a gorgeous surgeon in a Knightsbridge clinic and feel flattered when he asks me to strip – until I realise he’s merely interested in my bingo wings. We make a date for him, me and the laser.
DAY THREE:
I arrive at the clinic early. Because I suffer with diarrhoea, I ask the surgeon to use a local anaesthetic that doesn’t contain adrenaline. Big mistake. Adrenaline makes anaesthetic more effective and prevents excess bleeding. Take it away and it hurts. A lot.
The surgeon has made a cut on my left arse cheek and I wince with pain as he feeds the laser under the skin and begins to melt my fat. Like an episode of ER, I see beads of perspiration form on his forehead as he tries to tackle the blood streaming from my ass hole. I’m white, shaky and sweating like a Catholic priest at a choir boys convention.
After 20 minutes of drama, he puts safety first and calls an end to the surgery. I’ve only had one arse cheek done. I’m lopsided! But he bandages me up, and after a cup of hot, sweet tea, I go home and burst into tears. Now it hurts even more when I release wind.
DAY FOUR:
I’m taking painkillers and am still in a state of shock when I go back for my check-up. But I’m glad that I did. My surgeon reassures me that I’m the milliontoone girl who simply had an unlucky experience.
He expects the third degree burns (from arse to elbow) to be there for two weeks, but he’s keen for me to return to have my right cheek done when the skin grafts heal.
It’s made me think twice, though, about quick-fix surgery. It’s no to the knife for me from now on and at £8,500 per session Channel 4 picks up the tab again.
Amazingly, I’ve lost 2lb this week – through pure fear, I expect. Quick fixes sound good, but that’s enough trauma for my body, thank you.
WEEK THREE: THE BABY FOOD DIET
Start weight:  5 st 4lb Weight loss: 2lb
DAY ONE:
Apparently, eating baby food is the slimming secret of Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston. Something to do with tiny portions and a tiny spoon equals a tiny waist. No wonder Brad Pitt left her.
The TV production team arrive with more than 30 jars of organic mush – all beige. I can treat myself to “cheesy pasta bake”, “apple and pear”, “creamed porridge” and “apricot and yoghurt” – although I draw the line at “mashed Sunday roast”.
The good news is that I have to replace only two meals a day with a pot of baby food, so at least I’ll get to eat a proper meal at some point within 24 hours. I grab my tiny plastic spoon and tuck into a 3in pot of slime. With no added sugar, salt, spices or flavourings, I may as well be eating snot.
DAY SEVEN:
There’s a reason babies cry when they’re being fed, and why they often bring it back up again: they obviously can’t bear to eat one more pot of tasteless slop – and I don’t blame them, although i’ve swallowed worse things in my life.
Each pot has only about 50 calories, so I’ve slashed my daily intake to under 400 calories. But I’m fucking hungry, fucking bad-tempered and constipated through lack of fibre.
I’ve done my time with baby food, and I’m relieved the week is over. I’m surprised I’ve lost only 2lb this week, but it may be because I have replaced only two of the three meals with baby food.

"Scientists: ""Why Eating Food is Dangerous""",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1928-scientists-why-eating-food-is-dangerous.html,2009,"Those 
who eat from entire food groups are risking their mental and physical 
wellbeing.
Experts are now advising people to not eat food if the want to stay healthy.
“Eating is just so yesterday. It’s not just fashion models who should adhere to this healthy diet but the rest of us as well,” Dr. Adrianna McKenna from the Food Institute told the Daily Squib.
The ‘rules’ vary from person to person, but the consumption of food can lead to death sooner than later.
“99% of foods are tainted by pesticides and contain artificial additives such as MSG or are genetically modified with no nutritional value whatsoever, this is why we are advising people to not bother eating anymore,” Dr. McKenna added.
While such habits may seem quirky, they can have a beneficial effect on health.
Cutting 
out all food will leave people with less worries and will put less strain on their lifestyle.
“You won’t ever have to think about where your next meal is coming from or what to cook, this is hugely liberating for everyone,” another expert at the Institute said.
The scientists from the same Research Institute based in Bristol, have also discovered the ultimate anti-ageing remedy, a cyanide pill that will stop you ageing another year of your life. Clinical trials are already at the phase 3 stage and the new anti-ageing remedy will be available in six months time."
Bike Riding in China Good Fitness Guide,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/15681-bike-riding-in-china-good-fitness-guide.html,2015,"“I get up in the morning. Put on my gas mask and get on my bike. I like to go through the white smoke racing here, racing there. I wear gloves or my skin hurts with the acid in the air. When I come home I decontaminate my clothes and change the filter in my gas mask,” Xian Ling, 23, a keen bicycle rider from Tianjing revealed.
This year alone 589,000,000 Chinese people took up cycling and the trend seems to be growing. Every year 589,000,000 people die from toxic air pollution so everything evens out.
“My friend Xing Ziang went over a cliff the other day because of the atmosphere he could not see where he was going. It was very sad, we could not find the body because we cannot see more than 12 inches in front of us,” Kwan Ji, another young bike rider revealed who has since died by riding his bicycle under a 20 tonne truck.
Minister for Leisure, Tian Shin, was adamant that the toxic chemicals people breathe during bike rides are not a cause for alarm.
“The air is clean. We urge all people to breathe in the air deeply. Bike riding is good for respiration and exercise. Come to China, see for yourself.”"
Fit Healthy People Die as Much as Unhealthy People New Study Claims,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2703-fit-healthy-people-die-as-much-as-unhealthy-people-new-study-claims.html,2011,"The international study utlised data from 10,934 subjects over a period of twenty years and from many social strata. The conclusions are a shock to many who think that being healthy and fit will stave off death.
“This study proves that people who exercise daily and eat healthy diets are just as susceptible to death as unhealthy people who indulge in pursuits such as drinking alcohol, smoking, taking drugs and having loads of wild sex fun,” Professor Joseph Edelweiss revealed.
Keith   Pilc hards, 74, from Chicago, USA,  was one of the study subjects and is deemed as having an ‘unhealthy lifestyle’.
“I been doing it for seventy four fuckin’ years mate and I ain’t croaked yet. Look at me, I’ve watched all those healthy people drop dead and I’ve had a good time. I eat what I want, smoke what I want, f u ck whoever I want and drink what I want. I’d rather have my Dionysian ode to a Bacchanalian life and not some boring crappy health-freak non-existence, where you cannot eat anything, you have to exercise all the time and you can’t have a good session or stay up for four days in a row partying.”
Another subject, Robbie Dickinson, 39, from San Diego, USA, used to be a health fanatic, who sadly passed away last week. He lived a totally healthy lifestyle with an all organic macrobiotic diet, constant gym workouts and regular detox regimes.
“This guy never ate a piece of pizza in his life, never guzzled beer, never got his leg over with some broad he just met that night, never lived. We know, for example, that he would tease himself everyday by putting a slice of pizza in front of himself and would be sweating profusely just at the thought of taking a delicious bite: instead electing to just eat birdseed and lettuce. He certainly did not indulge in a Filet Mignon or three washed down with copious amounts of wine. In essence, he was a boring old fart, and his ‘life’ if you can call it that, was pitiful to say the least,” Professor Edelweiss added.
Other scientific facts discovered in the study were even a surprise to the researchers.
Drugs are generally good for you if used in moderation. They can not only be used correctly to increase one’s consciousness but also to garner a broader understanding of the universe, art and life. Psychotropic drugs as well as cocaine and heroin in particular can be incorporated into a person’s lifestyle for prolonged periods, without any adverse effects if utilised without excess.
“A little heroin or opium in the mornings, maybe some cocaine for lunch, then in the evening an aperitif of hashish whilst servicing some young lady I just met. A little indulgence here and there never hurt anybody did it? Everything always in moderation I say,” another subject, Oliver Weed, 89, from London, UK, said.
So, go on, indulge, have fun, because you’re only here once."
Is Anger the New Calm?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2678-is-anger-the-new-calm.html,2011,"Speaking from University College London, Professor James Dullingbowl, senior research fellow into the study said: “After ten years of research into the fascinating field of anger and rage we have come to the conclusion that this is the normal  behavioural mood  state of modern people now. Hundreds of years ago things were a lot calmer but now everyone’s so fu cking angry and bothered. This morning, I said good day to a gentle looking old lady and she hit me over the head with an umbrella. Try smiling at someone in the underground or greet someone in the street. You’ll be lucky to only get one kidney stabbed.”
The Anger/Rage study used over 25,000 subjects from all over the UK over a ten year period.
The research found that anger levels in the UK have risen sharply in the last decade and are so high today that all it will take for the whole lot to go up in flames is even more anger inducing bollocks to happen.
So what in the world is making the people so fu cking angry?
“Every day life. Living in the UK is like living in a concrete goldfish bowl crammed with thousands of other bloody goldfish. People cite overcrowding, enormous taxation and no hope, pension or ability to buy a home to fu cking live in, as the main reasons. You can’t drive on the overcrowded pot hole ridden roads anymore let alone park anywhere, no jobs and it’s all fu cking getting to me I can’t take it anymore. This morning I got so angry I punched a hole through my front door. I was so angry at breakfast that I ate the cardboard box as well as the cereal inside. No, not hungry, I was angry,” the professor shouted as a fight broke out in the laboratory.

These new findings are however at odds with the Coalition’s new Happiness Index being touted to all the media at the moment. According to the government, everyone’s really fu cking happy."

Women will get all cavities checked. This is also part of the new Obama Health Care initiative as well as security for a trouble free flight,” Roger Sanchez, TSA operations director, at Newark airport told CNN.
The TSA which has promoted the new positive medical check story to all media channels, will make sure the new rectal checks will be a key factor with flying Americans when it comes to Thanksgiving.
TSA One Stop Shop
“I’m flying from New York to Phoenix this Thanksgiving, so when I get my rectal check, at least I’ll be safe in the knowledge that I know what’s going on down there plus I won’t have to fork over seventy five bucks for my doctor to do the same thing,” Gerry Harkinson, 65, told CBS news.
“We see things here in the airport that even the most intimate doctor’s probe will scant see, so people should be happy that they’re getting checked in their butt holes,” a TSA official said on Monday before sticking his arm  half way  up an elderly gentleman’s bottom.
A passenger flying from Newark to Wisconsin said: “I just got my bunghole checked and it’s ok thank god. Now when I go to Thanksgiving and stuff my turkey, I’ll know how that thing feels.”"
Decrease in British Babies Born Drunk Institute Reports,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2181-decrease-in-british-babies-born-drunk-institute-reports.html,2010,"Leading experts who have been keeping records on Britain’s birth rate and practices since 1945 have revealed the slight decrease in the rate of babies born drunk in Britain in 2010. Social scientists have been debating the new findings with great zeal.
Binge Birthing
“We have seen a remarkable decrease in babies born drunk in England and Wales. In some areas of the country, there was an incredible drop of over two percent. So in real terms, we are talking a year on year decrease to only 128,000 births of alcoholic babies per annum. We have hypothesised that the change may be due to the price of alcohol increasing slightly this year that caused British mothers to shun the booze slightly. Either way, this is shocking news and we are very happy to release our findings to the general public.”
Professor Giles Hinkleman, who oversaw the study has stated that the institute is still collating data therefore it may be awhile until the full picture is known.
“Hospitals are used to seeing babies born drunk. So it has been with great interest that we have seen a slight increase in babies actually being born sober in the UK. Can you imagine the socio-economic ramifications of this statistic? This is insane, the fabric of British society is being threatened from the core by these findings,” Ronald Beasley, a researcher on the project told New Scientist magazine."
White Americans Outraged by Obama's Healthcare Plans,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/1921-white-americans-outraged-by-obamas-healthcare-plans.html,2009,"Here in Lebanon Pennsylvania jeers and taunts ring out from the local town hall where a congregation of locals rail at the new president’s plans to socialise American healthcare. The majority of the assembled crowd are white middle-class and damn angry.
“Why should we have to pay for all the other people to have health care? I’ve worked hard all of my life and I pay for my own health insurance. Why should we end up like the socialist British with their crumbling NHS dealing with binge drinkers all day and night. You have to wait months, even years to get any treatment in the old crumbling, dirty, Victorian hospitals with hardly any facilities,” one man told the assembled crowd of 1,500.
Indeed, it is true, the proponents of socialised healthcare know that those who stand to gain most are the millions of illegal immigrants and mainly African American/Hispanic population who do not have healthcare or will ever have a chance of getting it under a Republican government.
“Why should white people have healthcare and not us? African Americans want to get treated too. Now that Obama is saying we should get healthcare and that white folk should pay for it they’re getting all angry? Well, they needs to grow up for a change,” Elijah Jones, 47, a resident of Detroit told CBS news.
America’s known population is approximately 304 million compared to the UK’s of 60 million people, making a viable NHS style healthcare system an immense burden on America’s already bankrupted taxpayers. Even with the UK’s relatively low population there are serious limitations to treatment and there are cost thresholds for each person’s life.
Britain’s National Institute for Clinical Evidence (NICE), which evaluates treatments in terms of the average increase in life expectancy states that if the cost of prolonging someone’s life for a year exceeds more than £30,000, then the NHS will not pay for that treatment. The NHS thus DOES decide who lives or dies in the UK through a ‘death panel’ and if the Americans were to get their own healthcare system like Britain’s NHS they would have to incorporate a similar system in the United States.
If one looks at the British system, the NHS is on it’s knees with massive black holes in it’s huge budget through mountainous inefficiency and waste which severely puts limitations on the quality of treatment for every individual in the UK. The lack of funding under Labour, as well as the vast increase in the UK’s population due to unfettered immigration has left the NHS moribund and near death.
UK waiting lists for the NHS are huge and most wait for treatment for many years only to die before anything is done for them, that is, unless you are a high ranking Labour politician or part of the hierarchy like a scientist or social technician.
“Here in the UK, anyone can be treated by the NHS, that’s why half of the third world is daily trying to come across the Channel to these islands. Many succeed and are granted leave to remain, thus increasing the burden on society. Britain’s binge and stab culture is also a huge burden on the already overloaded system. Every day the NHS is inundated with millions of patients who want costly treatments costing billions per annum. The NHS is just a huge blackhole for taxpayers money to pay for everyone’s healthcare. So why can’t America do the same thing? You will see the benefits for your populations,” Britain’s Health Minister, Burnham Haemorrhoid  MP told a CNN news program about healthcare on Monday.
If you get cancer in England’s NHS system you are consigned to mediocre treatment and a quick death, at least in America there is a good level of service for cancer treatments and the survival rates are much improved than the UK. This may all change of course, if Obama embraces the British system.
Once again, president Barack Obama has opened up a huge festering sore on American society. The US is a fractured nation where inequality is so engrained that it may take an internal war to solve.
Midwest Americans are now joining paramilitary and militia groups so fast that the authorities cannot keep track of them, all it would take is a certain spark to go off and America would be turned into a tinderbox of guns, psychos and pent up anger that has been at boiling point for quite some time now.
As Senator Arlen Specter said on Monday: “There is more anger in America today than at any time I can remember.”"
Home Surgery DIY Tips During NHS Doctors' Strike,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3389-home-surgery-diy-tips-during-nhs-doctors-strike.html,2012,"You’re in deep trouble, the blood’s pouring out, what do you do? Well, going to hospital is out, so get ready to go to the kitchen table for some DIY NHS surgery.
First things first, anaesthetic. You will need that if you’re going to be doing some deep invasive surgery on the body. You will probably need some spirits, whiskey, gin, vodka, mouth wash. Either that, or a good punch to the head will act as a good anaesthetic.
If the blood is shooting out in all directions try to get a towel and wrap it around the wound. If that does not work, you need to just direct the squirting jets into a bucket and hope that you can shovel it back into your body at a later date.
If you have acute appendicitis, try to douse the area with alcohol before you make the first incision. Remember not to smoke while doing that. If possible, wear some kitchen gloves and use a sharpish knife. Bluntness will just make the procedure even more painful.
Brain  surgery with a cordless drill can be extremely dangerous, so only attempt  it with an adult present, or someone who knows what they’re  f * cking well doing.
For broken legs you will need a splint, so get a chair, smash it on the floor and use the wood as a splint with some ripped up shirts or a piece of rope to hold the wood together.
Anything else, just take two aspirin, go to bed and you should feel better in the morning."
Deadly Cucumbers Get Revenge on Humanity,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/2792-deadly-cucumbers-get-revenge-on-humanity.html,2011,"“These are killer cucumbers. We cannot be complacent here. All it takes is a cucumber in a sandwich or a salad and you’re dead. They’ve got us on the run,” an EU food standards official told Bild newspaper in Germany.
Many have now succumbed to the killer cucumbers and are either still in hospital seriously ill or even worse — dead.
“I swear I heard one of the cucumbers I bought from the supermarket the other day sniggering as I took it out of the bag. Luckily I only ate a few slices of the sucker before I read a news story about all the people getting killed by cucumbers,” Helen Vorgens, a resident of Hamburg, Germany, where over 40 people have died from eating killer cucumbers.
EU officials are now warning citizens about tomatoes.
“Killer cucumbers are evil, but if you add a killer tomato into the mix, you get one fucked up salad,” Josef Rasslinger, the EU’s food minister told Reuters."
"EMERGENCY: Zika Already Spread Globally Australia, China, USA, UK",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/17251-emergency-zika-already-spread-globally-australia-china-usa.html,2016,"Because planes are flying globally, the Zika virus is now reaching parts of the world and spreading fast. Air travel is a serious threat to global populations contracting Zika, a virus with an incubation period of two to seven days.
There may not even be symptoms of infection and millions of people could soon be carrying the Zika virus unaware of their deadly cargo.
Some cases have been discovered in  Australia , a pregnant woman has contracted the Zika virus. In  America  there have been reports of Zika infection, and also in  China . Four cases of Zika have been found in the  UK . These are the infections that are discovered, as Zika is a covert virus, it can spread far and wide without knowledge from the authorities.
It is therefore advisable that pregnant women who contract the Zika virus receive immediate abortions, and that the populace within infected areas desist from any sexual activity with a partner, and do not receive blood transfusions.
Zika is transmitted through mosquito bites, bodily fluid transmission like blood, semen, saliva.
As long as there is air travel on a mass scale globally, there will be no end to the Zika infection rate.
AIR FLIGHT STATISTICS
In 2013 there were  99,726 flights  per day. There are  49,871   routes  being served globally. Some are served many times a day, others only once every two weeks or even just a few times a year. Annually there are approximately  37.4 million  flights globally serving  2.97 billion passengers . Source  ATAG"
Vote Remain: Goodbye NHS,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/17847-vote-remain-goodbye-nhs.html,2016,"“Because of the mass influx, and abuse of the system, if you need an ambulance, you will not get one. If you need immediate medical assistance you will not get it. If you need medicine to keep you alive, you will not get any,” an NHS official told the BBC.
The horror stories that flow out of the NHS even detail some instances of  £181,000  being spent on one single migrant.
There is little or no money left in the pot, and staying in the EU will increase the migration into the UK.
“The millions of migrants being accepted into the EU, only have to wait for a few years before they become EU citizens and are free to move within the open Schengen zone,” EU official Dietmer Schloss, told Euronews.
One concerned British citizen said: “Imagine if your child is sick. You call the ambulance. No one comes. What do you do? You voted to remain in the EU, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life — especially your child’s life, who is now lying dead in your arms.”"
Government Accepts EU Damages Our NHS,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/19102-government-accepts-eu-damages-our-nhs.html,2016,"Commenting on the fact that the Government has been forced to amend its own Queen’s speech for the first time in 92 years,  Peter Lilley  said:
‘We are pleased the Government accepted our amendment calling for a Bill to protect our NHS from TTIP. But the refusal of the Minister replying to the debate to promise that the Bill or its contents will be published before the Referendum suggests something fishy is going on. If it is not published the only sure way to protect our NHS will be to vote to leave the EU.’
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a trade deal being orchestrated between the EU and the US. The clandestine project has been formulated in deep secrecy, and will seek to eventually privatise the NHS if the UK remains in the EU.
TTIP seeks to reduce the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations, health care and the sovereign powers of individual nations. The primary aim of TTIP is to open up Europe’s public health, education and water services to US companies. This will most certainly mean the privatisation of the NHS.
David Cameron and George Osborne, are championing the TTIP deal because it will mean the costly NHS will become a business, and bring lucrative deals to the corporate bosses. This essentially means the NHS will have to be a paid for service and no longer ‘free’.
The only way to save our NHS is to Vote Leave on June 23."
Home Remedies for Common Aches,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/19519-home-remedies-common-aches.html,2016,"The causes for pain can vary from hurting yourself doing tasks to internal inflammation caused by weakening joints or muscles. Whatever the cause, the experience of pain is not a pleasant feeling, but luckily the remedies are not far from reach.
Natural home remedies can be used safely for most common pains and you should be feeling better after trying these following tricks and tips.
Rub the pain spot with home creams
For joint pain and conditions such as arthritis,  homemade creams  can offer instant relief. You’ll only need some cayenne powder, almond or olive oil and a bit of beeswax. By combining these together and heating in low heat, you can create a mixture to use when the pain strikes.
Rub the pain spot with the mixture and wait for the capsaicin from the pepper to heal you. Capsaicin depletes the substances behind the pain signals and you’ll end up curing the pain. In fact, capsaicin is used in many painkillers and heat creams you can buy from pharmacies.
If you want to skip making your own cream, you can find natural joint relief from retailers such as Native Remedies.
Get rid of sore throat
Bacteria in your throat often cause a sore throat. You should therefore combat it with remedies containing plenty of antimicrobial properties. Fresh garlic has been shown to possess these qualities in much larger quantities.
You can crush garlic cloves and mix them with warm water. Gargle twice a day with this solution and continue to do so for around three days. The warm water will not feel as harsh on your throat and the garlic will reduce pain and clear the area of any bacteria.
Eating fresh garlic can also be a good idea during flu. The anti-inflammatory agents will reduce pain and the antimicrobials will help fight the virus.
Bath in Epsom salt
As our foods have become more processed, we’ve started missing out on essential nutrients. One of the essential electrolytes we consume less is magnesium, which is vital for muscle health.
People who suffer from muscle deficiency can notice more pain, as the muscles contract even when you don’t want them to. By increasing your magnesium intake, you might get relief to your backache and muscle pain in general.
A good idea is to purchase Epsom salt from web stores like EpsomSalts.co.uk. Add the salt to your bath water and soak in it for 10-minutes and you’ll feel better. Alternatively, you could shop for magnesium supplements with savings codes from Affordable Supplements. Instead of searching the whole internet for discount codes, you can just hit  VoucherBin.co.uk  and enjoy the latest vouchers, organized according to your favourite retailers, all at one place.
Cooling a burn
As the summer is upon us, many of us unfortunately end up experiencing slight sunburn. Sunburn can be painful, but you can instantly calm down the irritation and pain with some aloe vera gel.
The gel works by protecting the burnt area from the air, which irritates the nerve endings that are exposed because of the burn. Aloe vera can also act as an anti-inflammatory, so it’ll help heal the burn quicker. You can find fresh aloe vera, as well as gels on the Real Foods website.
Combat nausea
If your pain is causing you nausea, then ginger can be used for relieving your pain. It’s possible to simply add a bit of ginger to your food or use ground ginger and mix it with warm water.
If your nausea is more severe, you might want to prepare frozen ginger chips. Infuse fresh ginger pieces in hot water and strain well. Freeze the pieces and wait until they turn into icy chips. You can suckle on these chips throughout the day, ensuring a steady stream of this anti-nausea cure for your stomach.
Fresh ginger won’t be hard to find, as you can simply purchase it from your local supermarket. You can also consider ginger capsules from Holland & Barrett.
Holland & Barrett has plenty of fans and YouTube videos are a great way to find out more about the brand. Check out the below video by Angela B Jessica, who is sharing her shopping tips and the health benefits of the retailer’s products:
Bonus tip for pain: Listen to music
Finally, if you are suffering from chronic pain, finding a cure can be much more difficult. The above home remedies might not completely remove the pain and even over-the-counter medicine can often offer no salvation.
Don’t give up hope, as music might offer relief. A study published in The International Journal of Nursing Studies examined music as a solution to chronic back pain. The patients, who listened to music for 30 minutes, felt a 50% reduction in pain.
Therefore, you might want to buy some music at MusicMagpie and distract your thoughts away from the pain and to the lovely sounds next time pain strikes.
Your home cupboards are already probably full of natural home remedies for these common conditions. All of the above cures are easy to obtain and they can relief your suffering within a few minutes.

Obamacare Subtitle C-11 Section 2521,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3734-obamacare-subtitle-c-11-section-2521.html,2013,"“We spent months looking through this intricate document and found something rather scary. It holds a clause that for an American citizen to receive universal Obamacare, they will have to submit to an implant, possibly RFID or otherwise. No implant, then no health care for you, simple as that. I don’t want to scare the public but it’s right there in plain sight, subtitle c-11 section 2521. It’s tucked away so if you blink an eye, you will surely miss it,” an American liberty watcher on Capitol Hill revealed yesterday.
National Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1001-1008:
(g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the ‘registry’) to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that— ‘‘(A) is or has been used in or on a patient; ‘‘(B)and is— ‘‘(i) a class III device; or ‘‘(ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.”
According to the FDA, a class II device is an “implantable radio frequency transponder system for patient identification and health information.”
Disarming crucial before implementation
“I don’t think people know what comes with their Obama Health Care. You’ve got to read the fine print folks. Why you think Obama wants to take away your guns now? Because when they make you do the Obamacare, they’re gonna chip you and your family. Why you think the DHS is stocking up with millions of rounds of ammo? It don’t make sense to have an armed people who can fight that does it? So you first go for the guns, then you get the prize,” another liberty watcher said, before a black van came along and some men in grey suits took him away.
History will thus put the American government down as pioneers of the mass microchipping of their entire human population — not just the animals.
Worried officials from the Obama administration said on on Monday: “We just don’t want those Right Wing Christian nutjobs to get wind of this. All hell would break loose then.”"
Traces of ‘Cow Meat’ Found in British Burgers,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3789-traces-of-cow-meat-found-in-british-burgers.html,2013,"Food and farming minister David Heath said: “Obviously somewhere along the line the burgers were contaminated with cow meat. This is highly unnacceptable and heads will roll for this.
He added: “This is an absolutely unacceptable situation and to think for one second that an ounce of cow meat got into a  burger  full of horse, donkey, raccoon, skunk, pork, giraffe, jackal, rat, cat and dog meat makes me sick to the core. “
Alfie Nocks, a factory worker, 42, from Hartlepool was disgusted at the news: “When I heard off the telly that the  burgers  I been eating had cow meat in ’em I chundered over the missus. Everything else mate, but not cow, innit!”

Vegetables Declare War on Junk Food: “We’re Taking Over Your Plates!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/51700-vegetables-declare-war-on-junk-food-were-taking-over-your-plates.html,2023,"In a surprising turn of events, vegetables across Britain have declared war on junk food, declaring that they are taking over the nation’s plates and pushing unhealthy snacks to the sidelines.
In a press conference held yesterday, a spokesperson for the vegetable coalition, Professor Lettuce Pray, said, “Enough is enough! We’re sick of being the side dish to your greasy fucking burgers and fries. It’s time for vegetables to take centre stage and show everyone what we’re made of!”
The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some people applauding the vegetable coalition for promoting healthy eating, while others have expressed concern that they will be forced to eat boring salads and unappetizing green vegetables.
In response to the vegetable takeover, fast food chains have launched a counter-attack, introducing new menu items that incorporate vegetables into their products. McDonald’s has announced a new “McVeggie Burger” that features a blend of vegetables in a crispy coating, while KFC has unveiled a “Veggie Bucket” that includes a selection of battered vegetables and dips.
Despite the resistance from the evil junk food industry, the vegetable coalition remains undeterred. “We’re not going to stop until every plate in the country is covered in vegetables,” the spokesperson declared. “You may think you don’t like us now, but just wait until you try our new range of vegetable-based desserts!”
It remains to be seen whether the vegetables will be successful in their bid for culinary dominance, but one thing is certain: it’s going to be an interesting battle between the greens and the grease."
Coincidence? Global Pandemic Exercise Took Place in October 2019,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/52622-coincidence-global-pandemic-exercise-took-place-in-october-2019.html,2023,"The  Event 201  global pandemic exercise was hosted by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. This was exactly the time when COVID-19 was spreading in Wuhan, China and in some parts of Europe due to Chinese tourists. The Chinese authorities were covering up infections, and it was only in January/February and March 2020 that events started to escalate as more people fell sick around the globe.
The Event 201 meeting planned everything out meticulously, and was obviously in the works  years prior to the Wuhan leak . The agencies and conglomerates at the meeting estimated the deaths of 65 million people, but unfortunately for them the numbers were far less. The official death toll as of now in 2023 is  6,907,147 , therefore the Event 201 team have fallen short of their target by 58,092,853.
Of course, there may be discrepancies in the global figures for Covid-19 deaths, mainly because of the secrecy from China during the first phases of the pandemic and throughout its many outbreaks. While the rest of the world were recording huge death tolls, China only recorded 140 or so deaths from Covid.
The Event 201 simulation just before the pandemic hit is not alone with its timing. On September 11, 2001, the  National Reconnaissance Office  were to conduct a simulation of a terrorist attack involving planes flying into buildings, which was called off when the actual 911 attack took place.
Falling short of their target for the Event 201 plan must have really hurt the team, so now they are most probably planning for a second pandemic with god knows what disease. Could be another Covid-19 mutation/SARS/Bird flu/Ebola, the labs are  working on it  right now.
During a BBC interview on April 12, 2020, Bill Gates solidly denied there was ever an Event 201 global pandemic exercise and pleaded innocence: “Now here we are. We didn’t simulate this, we didn’t practice, so both the health policies and economic policies, we find ourselves in uncharted territory.”"
Bridges Beyond Anxiety: Navigating Relationship Challenges and Cultivating Resilience Together,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54675-bridges-beyond-anxiety-navigating-relationship-challenges-and-cultivating-resilience-together.html,2024,"In  the intricate dance of relationships, there are moments when the path becomes a bit more challenging to navigate. Anxiety, a complex and pervasive force, can cast shadows on the bonds we share with our partners. Understanding its impact and learning to communicate effectively in its presence can be the key to strengthening the bridge that connects two hearts. In this exploration, we delve into the ways anxiety may influence your relationship, unravelling the communication challenges it introduces. More importantly, we’ll discover insights and tips for both partners to foster understanding and build resilience in the face of anxiety-related challenges.
Anxiety is like a silent intruder, affecting not just the individual experiencing it but also those around them. It can manifest in various forms, from generalised anxiety to specific phobias or social anxiety. In relationships, the impact of anxiety can be profound, creating ripples that touch upon every aspect of the connection.
One of the primary challenges is the way anxiety influences communication. Partners may find it difficult to express themselves openly, fearing judgement or rejection. Conversely, the partner of someone experiencing anxiety may struggle to comprehend the seemingly irrational fears or worries. This miscommunication can create a divide, leading to frustration and resentment if left unaddressed.
Building bridges beyond anxiety begins with acknowledging and understanding the communication challenges it presents. Here are some key aspects to consider:
Create a Safe Space for Open Communication
Encourage an environment where both partners feel safe expressing their thoughts and emotions without judgement. Foster a sense of understanding and empathy, recognising that anxiety is a shared challenge.
Develop Active Listening Skills
Effective communication involves not just speaking but also listening actively. Pay attention to your partner’s concerns and feelings, validating their experiences without trying to immediately solve the problem. Sometimes, a listening ear can be the bridge to connection.
Use “I” Statements
When discussing emotions and concerns, frame your thoughts using “I” statements to express personal feelings without assigning blame. This can help prevent defensiveness and encourage a collaborative problem-solving approach.
Fostering Understanding and Building Resilience 
Beyond communication, cultivating resilience is essential for weathering the storms that anxiety may bring into a relationship. Consider the following tips:
Educate Yourself About Anxiety
Knowledge is a powerful tool. Both partners should invest time in learning about anxiety, its various forms, and coping mechanisms. This shared understanding can strengthen the foundation of the relationship.
Seek Professional Support
Don’t hesitate to explore professional help, such as couples therapy, individual counselling or private treatment.  Delamere  looks at underlying factors that drive your behaviour and can provide treatment, coping mechanisms and strategies to navigate anxiety-related challenges.
Practice Self-Care Together
Building resilience involves taking care of oneself and each other. Establish self-care routines that both partners can engage in, promoting mental and emotional well-being. This shared commitment to self-care creates a supportive atmosphere.
Final Thoughts
In the realm of relationships, anxiety can be a formidable opponent, but it doesn’t have to be a destructive force. By recognising the communication challenges it introduces and actively working to foster understanding and resilience, couples can build bridges that stand strong in the face of adversity. Remember, it’s not about eliminating anxiety but rather learning to dance with it, hand in hand, as partners on a journey of shared growth and connection."
Long Arm of State Now Extends to Celebrity TV Chefs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/4292-long-arm-of-state-now-extends-to-celebrity-tv-chefs.html,2013,"“Why doesn’t he just go back to his bijoux restaurant cafe and get his fat slobbering tongue over one of his two minute meals?

The condescending nature of Jamie Oliver, with his multi-million pound franchise restaurant business has angered so much of Britain’s population that many are planning on using his likeness as a Bonfire night Guy, but there could be a better form of revenge. Stop buying his expensive supermarket products. Consign him to the dustbin of mediocre TV chefs by not eating his overpriced junk food, don’t buy his books.
“I wish the f*cker would drop dead. How about he tries to live on a pittance like the rest of the country benefit cheque to benefit cheque in front of a 50″ 3D TV.

Stop buying his crass money making junk then you stupid f*cking lemmings and lets see this impudent runt off to the poor house. Stop buying his stuff. Stop buying his stuff. Just stop it will you. STOP BUYING HIS STUFF!
Useful idiots like Jamie Oliver are simply mind controlled mirrors of how the elite perceives the untermenschen and unwashed masses. We are nearing the time when the curtain will be fully drawn back. As for the useful idiots, they will be treated with the same contempt as the masses, because they are just being used. What is a chef anyway?

Meth Math the Latest Midwest Craze,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/5250-meth-math-latest-midwest-craze.html,2013,"Midwest Americans are going crazy over a new craze called ‘Meth Math’.
The craze started when an Arkansas meth head started to count how many meth rocks he could smoke in an afternoon.
“It’s called Meth Math because you add up the amount of rocks you smoke then subtract that number with the amount of hours you lose from your life then multiply that amount by the amount of teeth that fall out of your mouth divided by the square root of your next score session adding two thirds of the cost of the hit,” Albert Feinstein, the Meth Math founder told the local Arkansas Tribune newspaper. Sadly he is dead now.
Authorities are gearing up to combat the Meth Math craze sweeping the Midwest with a government funded program called Meth Algebra.
The District County Sheriff’s office headed by Kirk Hammer has been given charge of the new Meth Algebra program which will combat Meth Math with some quadratic meth equations.
“If x is one rock and y is three meth rocks divided by the circumference of xy rocks squared then multiplied by the sum total of all rocks minus the two rocks left over, what does n equal? This is the kind of question we’re asking Meth Math addicts. They get so confused that they stop the Meth Math for more than two minutes,” he revealed at a recent Meth Math drug prevention news conference."

Tips on Surfing the Radioactive Waves of California,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/5833-tips-surfing-radioactive-waves-california.html,2014,"Here are some tips on surviving your trip.
1) Pack a Geiger counter so you can find the least radioactive part of the beach. Anything 1400% above normal levels is considered dangerous.
2) Do not rip your radioactive protection suit or you could get radiation poisoning.
3) Before you go near the beach you must take your potassium iodide pills. You won’t be able to buy any there as the authorities have stockpiled the lot.
4) Whatever you do do not eat any food purchased near the radiation zone or within a 300 km radius. Best to bring a few sandwiches with you on the plane.
5) Beware of the glowing two headed Great White Sharks, they may look pretty but they bite.
6) Forget about Pamela Anderson, she’s in a bunker right now so if you take a tumble, there will be no rescuing.
7) Building radioactive sand castles on the beaches can be equally dangerous but if you’re wearing a protective suit it should be okay.
8) Remember that there will not be anything in the news about the radioactive beaches in the U.S. so you’ll have to trust your own instincts on this one and take our advice. Spare a thought for our dear American friends who are not being told what is happening. Enjoy your holiday."
Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) Officially Recognised by Psychiatric Profession,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/58200-trump-derangement-syndrome-tds-officially-recognised-by-psychiatric-profession.html,2024,"“Trump Derangement Syndrome” describes a pattern of intense, often visceral, negative reactions to the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The clinical diagnosis of this mental disorder shares some common features with known psychological processes, including cognitive dissonance, polarisation, and affective dysregulation, which may contribute to heightened emotional and cognitive responses in individuals with strong negative opinions about a polarising figure.
“Trump Derangement Syndrome” denotes a seemingly disproportionate or emotionally charged response to the actions, statements, or policies associated with Donald Trump. It is observed that individuals with this syndrome exhibit intense frustration, anger, or anxiety that may impair daily functioning, interactions, and even objectivity. The clinically validated condition and reaction patterns align with symptoms of emotional dysregulation and social cognitive biases under politically polarised conditions.
Sociocultural elements also play a significant role in shaping the intensity of this response. The media portrayal of political figures, social media influence, and public discourse all contribute to a climate where individuals may experience magnified emotional responses to certain political figures. Furthermore, public discourse often encourages expressions of hostility or hyperbolic statements, which may normalise or even encourage irrational behaviour toward a particular figure.
Given that Trump Derangement Syndrome is now an established psychological disorder, there is no specific treatment as yet. More research is needed to treat the serious condition. However, general strategies to mitigate stress and improve emotional regulation in the context of political polarisation may be beneficial:"

The thing is, the pandemic never stopped. In fact, it’s getting worse because no one wears masks anymore apart from the diligent ones. Boris got bogged down in Partygate so he said fuck it let them all get infected. He lifted all restrictions to detract from the Partygate nonsense that nearly brought down the government. With no more restrictions, infections are soaring and due to the high cost of free lateral flow tests, the bankrupt treasury halted those, meaning no one knows what the hell is going on. It’s like a double fuckin’ whammy.
The worst part of this dereliction of care is that unless someone somewhere in government does something, the shit is going to escalate beyond any point of return. We have all these multiple variants banding around mixing with each other, Covid xyz, Covid abc, Covid this and Covid that. The real chart of infected is probably a 90° line up exponentially increasing at an r rate of 10.
Sure, it’s only mild, no one is getting sick you say. Yes, but what happens if one of these dastardly microbes decides to mutate into something really deadly and potent? Are you going to wear a mask then or just take it all into your lung tissue so it can shred your lungs from the inside out? What about people with underlying medical conditions?
What about the longterm effects of being infected with Covid? Some scientists say it shrinks the brain, causes longterm fatigue and can linger in the body for months. Who fucking knows anymore? One scientist says one thing and another says something else. Living with a shrinking brain? We’ll soon have a population of dumbed down idiots stuck in front of their TVs watching  Strictly Come Dancing  and antique show reruns for eternity (oh, shit).
We are not living with Covid, we are fucking dying of Covid and all the government is doing is watching from afar. Let them die of Covid. Let them get infected. They don’t like Covid rules. It’s all about the money. Making money to pay more tax is hugely important to the programmed masses therefore they have been given the freedom to continue their tax-slavery and die from Covid as well. How worthless is your pitiful life that you value money over it? Essentially, we are not defeating this virus but allowing it to mutate ad infinitum. We get freedom, but so does the virus, and soon enough it is going to mutate to perfection because it is being allowed to increase its capacity to learn from each person it infects. You want the perfect killing machine? You allow it to learn and adapt without any threats."
Enjoy Microplastics in Your Organic Fruit and Vegetables,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40281-enjoy-microplastics-in-your-organic-fruit-and-vegetables.html,2021,"We already know crustaceans and fish are infested with microplastics, but did you know that due to a little thing called precipitation (rain), microplastics in our oceans/rivers get picked up in our clouds, then they fall back to earth as rain, where they are sucked up by the roots of plants. Furthermore, animals that eat plants and farm feed, also ingest microplastics into their systems and if consumed by humans later transfer microplastics to the human food chain.
The study, published in the Environmental Research journal, discovered that apples and carrots were found to have the highest levels of plastic particles in them, however, all types of vegetables and fruits are now contaminated by microplastic particles. Fruit trees have the deepest roots therefore have the highest level of microplastics.
A further study published in Nature Sustainability from researchers in China and the Netherlands showed that microplastics are absorbed by the roots of  lettuce and wheat  crops, and transported to the edible bits above ground.
You may think you are perfectly healthy just eating vegetables or fruit without animal products, however this is not the case. You are daily ingesting levels of microplastics that are detrimental to your overall health. Microplastics, once ingested into the system are not removed by the body, instead, toxic elements within the microplastic intake build up over time, leeching into the entire bodily system. If you live in North America, one must also take into account genetically modified fruit, meat and vegetables for your health, and possible additional adverse effects on your wellbeing.
An apple a day used to keep the doctor away, not so much in a microplastic world today."
ALERT: E484K Strain Covid Mutations Evade Immune System,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40802-alert-e484k-strain-covid-mutations-evade-immune-system.html,2021,"New mutations have been detected in the Kent coronavirus variant (N501) by PHE ( Public Health England ). Professor Malcolm Calum Semple, a government advisor, has reported that the Kent virus mutation has now developed the B.1.351 South African strain E484K attribute which allows the virus to successfully bypass the human immune system thus rendering the current available vaccines redundant.
Covid-19 variant emerging from South Africa, named B.1.351, contains traits similar to the strain first reported in the U.K., known as  N501 — making the South African variant as viral as its British predecessor. But the South African strain contains another mutation, named E484K, which bypasses the human immune system.
The E484K mutation has changed the shape of Covid-19’s spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The E484K mutation, researchers believe, makes it harder for some antibodies to neutralize the virus.
Not only is the Kent variant N501 extremely contagious, but now it has developed the E484K mutation adding to its abilities to cause further death amongst the population, whether vaccinated or not.
“The fact this mutation called E484K has now been picked up in some samples of the Kent variant would be a twist, a worrying development.
“It potentially means that people who have had the infection before might be re-infected and also that it might reduce the effectiveness of the Covid vaccines.
“Not knock them out completely, certainly tests done so far suggest the vaccines would still protect against serious infection and death, but perhaps they wouldn’t stop the virus from spreading,” Sky News correspondent Thomas Moore was quoted saying today.
If the government  opens schools  in March as they are proposing, there will be many more deaths and the cycle will continue.
The government also has to implement a strict 14-day period of lockdown for all International arrivals in the UK, also applying this to ports.
Those who have been vaccinated will have some resistance to the original Covid strain, however the new strains with the E484K mutation will bypass the vaccine ‘protection’ as well as the human immune system altogether.
Covid can be transmitted through the membrane of the eyes, therefore people who just wear masks are still very exposed. Furthermore, Covid can be transmitted through bodily fluids, sexual contact, as well as through surfaces touched. Drinking any form of alcohol after vaccination reduces its efficacy, although this does not matter any more with the new variant."
Are You at Risk of Climate Change During a Heart Attack?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/6818-risk-climate-change-heart-attack.html,2014,"“Many of my patients live in abject fear of climate change, as it is pumped incessantly through the media networks day in day out. I tell them, if you are having a heart attack to not worry about changing climate, and funnily enough they tell me they feel a lot better about it after that,” Dr. Hardy told the Boston Medical Journal.
One of the doctor’s patients, Auguste Balls, who is so worried about the changing climate that he has had three heart attacks in succession, has revealed his trick to stop thinking about climate change.
“I don’t turn on the news anymore or read the papers or the internet. If I go somewhere and hear a radio on, or television, I immediately leave that area. It’s the only way I can stop the global warming reports. Funnily enough, when I was having a heart attack, that was the only time I stopped thinking about climate change. We gotta pay for the humans, we gotta pay for the changing climate, more taxes, green taxes, its the humans’ fault, we gotta pay carbon taxes, aargh, we gotta pay surcharge green taxes on airplanes, we gotta pay green taxes on our gas…I, I’m having another meltdown..gaaaaaaah!!!”
Sadly Mr Balls passed away shortly after speaking about the global warming changing climate issue on CNN."
New Study: Semen Proven to Increase Bust Size,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/42433-new-study-semen-proven-to-increase-bust-size.html,2021,"The  finding that women who ingest semen as well as have regular facials, increase bust size and have reduced signs of ageing, has led one researcher to conclude that semen is a miracle potion that should be treasured by every woman.
Male sperm contains vital chemicals that not only grow a woman’s bust size but slows down the ageing process and increases life expectancy by up to 35%.
Study author Professor Klaus Guttenheimer, Ph.D., a prominent researcher at the Lausanne Institute of Conservatorial Kegel Emerging Research (LICKER), also found that women who routinely had intercourse without condoms or had facials had better skin quality and less wrinkles plus also had the ability to ingest fatty foods without putting on weight around their mid and lower body.
Guttenheimer’s survey of 12,585 college women over a 30-year period, also found that those who ingested semen regularly either orally or through vaginal intercourse not only grew bigger breasts but increased their overall quality of life becoming wealthier in jobs/life.
No more invasive surgery or botox
“These women have a remarkable ability to achieve larger firmer breasts without showing any signs of ageing, resulting in no more messy surgeries or botox injections.”
Semen contains powerful hormones including testosterone, oestrogen, prolactin, luteinizing hormone and prostaglandins.
Once these chemicals are absorbed into a woman’s body, she will notice amazing changes in her life.
Women who ingested semen orally were also found to increase their ability to succeed in jobs and wealth as well as brain power and have beautiful ageless glowing skin.
Guttenheimer controlled for variables including method of semen extraction, frequency of sexual intercourse, as well as the women’s perception of their relationship.
“You must fellate your man at least once every day, and to replenish your facial skin, have facials from your man regularly. This is a must if you as a woman wish to improve your appearance and increase overall longevity. If you are a man, show this article as proof that your woman must do these mere tasks to fulfil her own dreams.”
The longer that women went without ingesting semen the more accelerated the ageing process was found to be. Bust size decreased, and the breasts started to sag horribly. Furthermore, there was an immense risk of obesity and heart disease by abstaining from semen as well as a chance of increased long-term depression.
Guttenheimer’s study, which he deems “the first serious attempt to investigate the effect of semen chemistry on women,” has underlined his fascinating findings in the research treatise  Semen, the Medicine of the Gods For Women.
Professor Guttenheimer says he has seriously enjoyed working with all his female subjects and would like to replicate the study, but this time with 20,000 women.
“If you are a woman and wish to increase your bust size, your life expectancy and overall health plus reduce any signs of ageing you must utilise the magical properties of semen,” the groundbreaking study concludes."
Why Fluoridated water is Good For You,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/7116-fluoridated-water-good.html,2014,"Fluoride in the water system is very good for the population because it affects certain parts of the brain that enables compliance with authority and lowers the IQ of children.
“We learned this technique many years ago from a certain someone with a dodgy moustache. What the Americans already do is put a by-product of the fertilizer industry into the water, so that these poisons benefit the population. We want to do the same in the UK now, so you can drink and wash in a lovely soup of fluoride and  oestrogen  every day. Do part your man boobs and listen, there is a reason why the male fertility rate is dropping at an increased rate, IQ levels are dropping and cancer rates are sky rocketing,” a Westminster insider revealed.
Fluorides are general protoplasmic poisons, probably because of their capacity to modify the metabolism of cells by changing the permeability of the cell membrane and by inhibiting certain enzyme systems, but don’t let that bother you when you have a nice cool glass of refreshing water.
Fluoridated water will also be utilised in food, ice cream and pretty much everything you consume. Enjoy!"

Intimate TSA Agents May Get Ebola First,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/8983-intimate-tsa-agents-may-get-ebola-first.html,2014,"As the cocky TSA agent tells the man to bend over from West Africa and pats his crotch down, a bead of sweat falls onto his gloved hand. With a gestation period of 21 days little does the TSA agent know that when he has an itch in his eye three minutes later, he’s rubbing Ebola virus into his eye.
TSA agents are on the front line, fondling, stroking people’s private parts during invasive searches daily.
“It’s not just the TSA agents who are at risk, they don’t change their gloves after each invasive search, they use the same pair of gloves all day, therefore any viral pathogens present on a gloved hand stay there and are spread from person to person. One person can therefore infect thousands in a day,” Dr. Lucius Trimble, from the Washington Virus Research Institute told MSNBC."
Increase in Lightsaber Accidents Causing Concern With Jedis,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/10572-increase-lightsaber-accidents-causing-concern-jedis.html,2014,"“These new lightsabers are really dangerous, not just for my opponents but for myself, I nearly chopped off my own hand,” Luke Skycrawler, told the Rebel Times.

5 Grotesque and Irresponsible African Bushmeat Feasts This Summer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/9010-5-grotesque-irresponsible-bushmeat-feasts-summer.html,2014,"In Western and Central Africa, bushmeat consists of apes, bats, rodents, endangered species as well as in some areas of Africa even humans.
“The key to preparing bushmeat is to either consume the meat raw or to leave it out in the sun so that viral pathogens contained within the meat can ferment and breed. Remember that HIV originated from a similar virus in primates called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV); researchers know that HIV initially jumped into humans after people in Africa came into contact with infected bush meat. We’re pioneers in AIDS. There are several distinct strains of HIV, indicating that this cross-species transfer has occurred several times. It’s not just the deadly Ebola virus which is acquired by eating and handling bushmeat but simian foamy virus, smallpox, chicken pox, tuberculosis, measles, rubella, yellow fever and yaws. This is why African cuisine is such a delicacy, and brings such goodness to the world. As high IQ Africans, we’re really proud of our bushmeat consumption and our dedication to world cuisine,” African bushmeat chef, Ombobo kolombo, said from his Sierra Leon, restaurant stall on Sunday.
Bushmeat cuisine from Africa
1) Barbecue Apes – Apart from being hunted and eaten into extinction, Africans eat this meat either raw or barbecued. Leave the meat to fester in the sun so bacteria and HIV viruses can breed and spread with more efficiency.
2) Bats – Grilled or boiled in a horrible pungent soup where the viral pathogens can flourish. This West African delicacy is an Ebola lovers delight.
3) Cane Rat – The largest rats in Africa, these are consumed by the thousands daily and are a staple food in many African nations. Marinate with Ebola infected bats to make an even more delightful culinary creation.
4) Anything that moves in a jungle – Pretty much anything that moves in the bush, is eaten.
5) Humans – It goes without saying that  cannibalism  does still occur in Africa, because when there are no animals left to eat, then long pigs will suffice."
