Mobility Aids: The Key to Maintaining Independence as We Age,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/55667-mobility-aids-the-key-to-maintaining-independence-as-we-age.html,2024,"As  we journey through life, ageing gracefully is a goal we all aspire to. However, as our bodies change with time, maintaining independence can become challenging, especially for elderly individuals facing mobility issues. Fortunately, advancements in mobility aids offer a path forward, enabling those with mobility issues to reclaim their autonomy and embrace life to the fullest.
Ageing brings with it a myriad of physical changes, from decreased muscle strength and joint flexibility to impaired balance and coordination. These changes can significantly impact mobility, making simple tasks like walking or climbing stairs difficult and sometimes dangerous. For elderly individuals, maintaining independence in their daily activities becomes increasingly challenging, leading to a loss of confidence and a diminished quality of life.
Independence is a cornerstone of well-being, allowing individuals to make their own choices and live life on their terms. However, when mobility becomes limited, independence often takes a hit. Many elderly individuals find themselves relying on others for assistance with basic tasks, which can be frustrating and demoralising. This loss of independence can also lead to social isolation as individuals may feel reluctant to venture out or participate in activities outside the home.
Mobility aids play a crucial role in bridging the gap between limited mobility and independence. These aids are designed to assist individuals in moving around safely and comfortably, both indoors and outdoors. From canes and walkers to wheelchairs and scooters, there is a wide range of options available to suit different needs and preferences.
Wheelchairs  are perhaps the most well-known mobility aid, providing invaluable support to individuals with mobility impairments. Modern wheelchairs come in various designs, from manual to electric, foldable to rigid, catering to a wide range of needs. For elderly individuals who struggle with walking long distances or standing for extended periods, a wheelchair can be a game-changer, allowing them to conserve energy and navigate their surroundings with ease.
A  rollator with seat  offers a unique blend of mobility and comfort, making it an excellent choice for elderly individuals who require occasional rest breaks while walking. These aids feature a lightweight frame with wheels, handlebars for stability, and a built-in seat for resting when needed. Rollators provide the support and confidence to venture out independently, knowing that a comfortable seat is always within reach.
When selecting a mobility aid for yourself or a loved one, it’s essential to consider your specific needs and preferences. Factors such as the level of mobility impairment, lifestyle, and environment should all be taken into account. Consulting with a healthcare professional or mobility specialist can help determine the most suitable option and ensure a proper fit.
Safety should always be a top priority when using mobility aids. Proper training on how to use the aid safely, including techniques for getting in and out of wheelchairs or navigating obstacles with a rollator, is essential. Additionally, ensuring that the aid is comfortable and properly adjusted to the user’s height and weight can prevent discomfort and minimise the risk of injury.
Despite the many benefits of mobility aids, there can still be a stigma attached to using them, with some individuals viewing them as a sign of weakness or dependency. However, it’s crucial to challenge these perceptions and recognise that mobility aids are tools for empowerment, not symbols of limitations. By reframing the narrative around mobility aids, we can encourage more individuals to embrace them as valuable resources for maintaining independence and enhancing quality of life.
Encouraging a loved one to use a mobility aid can be met with resistance, as they may fear losing their independence or admitting to their limitations. However, approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding can help alleviate these concerns. Emphasising the benefits of increased mobility, safety, and freedom can empower individuals to see mobility aids as tools for enhancing their lives, rather than limitations.
As we navigate the journey of ageing, maintaining independence becomes increasingly important for preserving dignity and quality of life. Mobility aids are invaluable at offering support, comfort, and freedom to elderly individuals or others facing mobility challenges. From wheelchairs to rollators with seats, these devices can empower individuals to move forward with confidence, reclaiming their independence and embracing life’s adventures with dignity. By embracing mobility aids and encouraging our loved ones to do the same, we can help them live life on their terms, navigating the world with independence.",Health
The Facts and Myths About Collagen: Is it Really Worth the Hype?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58710-the-facts-and-myths-about-collagen-is-it-really-worth-the-hype.html,2024,"If  you’re trapped in the social media wormhole every evening and can’t resist your nightly TikTok or Instagram Reels scroll, then you’ll have watched a video or two about collagen and how we’re all pretty much screwed after 25 years old.
Men have it slightly better – testosterone and male androgen secretions keep men’s skin younger looking for longer. And they start with thicker, plumper skin, making the appearance of fine lines and signs of ageing less obvious.
Actually, contrary to popular belief, men start to lose collagen earlier and more consistently throughout their lives and women hold onto more until menopause. Once the menopause kicks in, it’s a bumpy ride until you reach the other side, ladies.
Anyway, we digress. We’re here to talk about collagen and whether it’s really worth the hype. Read on to find out.
Let’s start with some myth-busting – there are definitely a lot of people spreading fake collagen news and selling fake collagen products:
Myth 1: Collagen is Only for Women
Collagen benefits everyone. Studies show it effectively supports muscle recovery and joint health. We’d say it’s a great supplement for athletes and the ageing population, but people don’t talk about how effective it can be for other reasons besides ageing.
Myth 2: All Collagen Supplements Are the Same
Absolutely not. There are so many variations (and yes, they matter). Marine collagen is better for the skin. Bovine collagen is better for joint and ligament support. And sometimes you don’t even need a supplement. If you’re wondering, ‘ do anti-wrinkle injections work? ‘ – they absolutely do work for boosting collagen production if they contain hyaluronic acid. Always do your research and find high-quality collagen supplements!
Myth 3: Collagen Causes Acne
There’s no evidence that collagen supplements trigger acne. Clogged pores and hormonal breakouts are more likely to be the issue.
Myth 4: Collagen Works Overnight
Collagen supplements take time to show effects. Sadly, it’s not an overnight fix. Weeks or months of persistent use will begin to generate the results you’re hoping for.
Now let’s move on to the facts about collagen that’ll get you wanting to try it:
Well,  people are going crazy for it  because of social media – and we wouldn’t say this is a negative thing. There are so many benefits to the endless videos about cosmetics and skin health. People are more aware of UV damage, taking collagen supplements, and using the correct skincare products; we’re not against the trend.
As for collagen, people are drawn to its anti-ageing benefits. The world seems to be hooked on staying younger for longer. And that’s why we think it’s a trend right now – it’s purely TikTok and other social media platforms, but we don’t think that’s a bad thing.
Yes, absolutely it is. If you can find the correct collagen supplement, and it’s high-quality, it’s absolutely worth the hype. It can and does produce results. Combine it with anti-wrinkle injections and the best skincare products, and you really will reduce and slow the signs of ageing. Oh, and of course, a healthy lifestyle and diet and 2L or more of water!
The confidence boost it’s giving people is incredible.
Ultimately, collagen isn’t a miracle cure – we won’t deny that. But we will follow the craze and say it really does have incredible benefits. Don’t knock it until you try it!",Health

Going Through Security
Security checkpoints can be a bit tricky with mobility aids. Inform the security staff of your mobility aid and any medical devices you may have. They may perform a manual inspection or use alternative screening methods to ensure your safety and comfort.
Using Airport Facilities
Many airports now have specialised facilities for travellers with mobility challenges, such as accessible restrooms, designated waiting areas, and shuttle services. Take advantage of these amenities to make your airport experience more comfortable.
Road trips offer flexibility and the opportunity to see sights along the way. However, travelling by car with mobility aids requires careful planning to ensure a smooth and enjoyable ride.
Ensuring Vehicle Accessibility
If you own a vehicle, make sure it is equipped to accommodate your mobility aids. This may involve using a wheelchair-accessible vehicle or installing a ramp or lift. If you’re renting a car, contact the rental company in advance to confirm they have accessible vehicles available.
Planning Rest Stops
Long car journeys can be exhausting, so plan regular rest stops to use accessible facilities. Research the route in advance to identify rest areas, restaurants, and petrol stations with accessible amenities.
Packing for Comfort
Make your car trip more comfortable by packing essentials such as cushions, blankets, and snacks. Ensure your mobility aids are securely stowed and easily accessible during the journey.
Public transportation can be a convenient and cost-effective way to travel.

Communicating with Transport Staff
When boarding public transport, communicate your needs to the staff. They can provide assistance with boarding, securing your mobility aid, and ensuring you have a comfortable ride.
Navigating Crowded Areas
Public transport can get crowded, especially during peak hours. Plan your trips during off-peak times when possible to avoid the rush and ensure you have enough space for your mobility aid.
Once you arrive at your destination, it’s time to explore! Here are some tips to help you make the most of your trip while using mobility aids.
Exploring Accessible Attractions
Many tourist attractions now offer accessible facilities and services, such as ramps, elevators, and guided tours for individuals with mobility challenges. Research and plan your visits to these attractions in advance.
Participating in Local Activities
Don’t miss out on local activities and experiences. Many destinations offer adapted tours, accessible nature trails, and workshops designed for individuals with mobility aids. Check with local tourism offices for recommendations.
Staying Safe and Healthy
Travelling can take a toll on your body, so prioritise your health and safety. Stay hydrated, take regular breaks, and listen to your body. If you experience any discomfort or health issues, seek medical assistance promptly.

Labour Condemns OAPs to Riding Buses and Sleeping in Libraries This Winter,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57369-labour-condemns-oaps-to-riding-buses-and-sleeping-in-libraries-this-winter.html,2024,"Old age pensioners  will be condemned to riding buses and trains all day and sleeping in libraries this winter just to stay warm. Other methods to keep warm are being explored by some innovative OAPs who have had their winter fuel payments snatched from them by the Labour government who have already squandered billions pandering to the Marxist unions, propping up unionised job sectors that are already swimming in grotesquely high salaries. Ten million pensioners will be affected by this heartless and evil decision to punish pensioners. Labour condemns OAPs in Britain to a tortuous, sad ending of their lives.
So, how can you stay warm when you are a lonely, old, possibly sick pensioner? One of the main ways is to stay in an area where there are lots of people. Examples of this would be shopping malls, train stations, buses, libraries, airports, hospital cafés, leisure centres.
Libraries
Libraries are always a good bet, although the government is shutting many of them down. There are free newspapers, so pensioners can even put a few layers of newspaper on their bodies for an extra layer of warmth. Most libraries open at 9am–6.30pm, and some libraries even close at 8pm. If you can afford to take a flask of tea or soup, that can help as well. Libraries are nice and warm and generally with minimal noise levels, so sleep can be accommodated quite easily.
Shopping Malls
Not everyone has a shopping mall near them, but if you do, then it would be good to capitalise on this. Shopping malls are usually well heated places away from the brutal cold and rain. You can sit in many places as there are benches in most areas. Due to most businesses going bankrupt, a lot of shopping malls in Britain are nearly empty, so the noise levels won’t be so bad. The best days to go are during weekdays, but best to avoid the weekends as there is a slight increase in footfall.
Underground Trains and Stations
If you live in London, get on the Underground. It’s nice and warm down there, and when the train comes through the tunnel, and you’re on the platform, you get a nice waft of warm air. Get on the train and ride it all the way to the end of the line and back. You can do this all day, catching some sleep along the way. Rush hour is a bit shitty, but if you’re seated, no worries. Take a small blanket if you need one, a flask and some sarnies. The best line to use is the Piccadilly Line because it goes all the way up to Heathrow from Cockfosters station. Overground stations are also an option but not as warm as other options, plus there are too many grifters, tramps and weirdos around.
These are some of the options available for OAPs during the 6 months of bone chilling winter in the UK. If you have dementia, then please ask for help from someone when getting on the trains and buses to stay warm. The irony is that the very train drivers who have been unjustly awarded £80,000 salaries at the expense of OAPs thanks to the unions and Labour will be the ones ferrying you around day in day out as you fight to keep warm. As Labour condemns OAPs to a life of living hell, it’s a good thing that they are at least caring for the pampered and very rich train drivers as well as ASLEF Union staff supping at  Claridges .",Health
The Benefits of Having a Home Gym,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57149-the-benefits-of-having-a-home-gym.html,2024,"C reating a home gym is becoming an increasingly popular choice for fitness enthusiasts. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or someone who is just starting on their fitness journey, having a dedicated space to work out at home offers plenty of benefits. This guide will explore the advantages of having a home gym, including the benefits of garage flooring options.
One of the most significant benefits of having a home gym is the convenience it provides. No more commuting to the gym, waiting for equipment to become available, or dealing with crowded spaces. You can work out whenever it suits you, whether it’s early in the morning or late at night. This flexibility can be a game-changer, especially for those with busy schedules.
Time-Saving
Without the need to travel to and from a gym, you save valuable time that can be better spent on your workout or other activities. This can make a substantial difference in maintaining a consistent fitness routine, which is crucial for achieving long-term goals.
Customised Workouts
With a home gym, you have complete control over the equipment and the type of workouts you do. You can tailor your gym to your specific fitness needs and preferences, ensuring you have everything you need to meet your goals.
When setting up a home gym, particularly in a garage, the flooring is a critical aspect that shouldn’t be overlooked. The right flooring can protect your equipment, provide a safe and comfortable surface for exercising, and even help with noise reduction.
Durability and Protection
Garage floors are typically made of concrete, which can be harsh on your body/joints and your equipment. Installing specialised gym flooring, such as rubber mats or tiles, can provide a cushioned surface that reduces the harsh impact on your joints during high-intensity workouts. Additionally, this type of flooring helps protect your weights and machines from damage.
Easy Maintenance
Gym flooring is designed to be easy to clean and maintain. Spills, sweat, and dirt can be quickly wiped away, ensuring your workout space remains hygienic and clean. Rubber flooring, in particular, is resistant to moisture and can withstand heavy usage without showing signs of wear and tear.
Noise Reduction
One of the less obvious but equally important benefits of proper gym flooring is noise reduction. Dropping weights or running on a treadmill can create a lot of noise, which might disturb other members of your household or neighbours. Rubber flooring helps to absorb these sounds, making your workouts quieter and more enjoyable.
A well-organised home gym is more efficient and enjoyable to use. Effective storage solutions are essential, especially if you’re working with limited space, like in a garage. Storage boxes and other organisational tools can help keep your gym tidy and ensure that everything is easy to find and access.
Versatile Storage Boxes
Storage boxes  are an excellent solution for keeping your gym equipment organised. They come in various sizes and can be used to store anything from small accessories like resistance bands and yoga blocks to larger items like kettlebells and dumbbells.
Benefits of Storage Boxes:
Wall-Mounted Racks and Shelving
In addition to storage boxes, consider installing wall-mounted racks and shelving. These can hold items like barbells, plates, and even bicycles, freeing up floor space for your workouts.
Benefits of Wall-Mounted Solutions:
Cost-Effectiveness
While setting up a home gym involves an initial investment, it can be more cost-effective in the long run compared to a gym membership. Over time, the savings on membership fees, transportation costs, and time can add up significantly.
No Membership Fees
Gym memberships can be expensive, and those costs add up over time. By investing in your own equipment, you eliminate the need for monthly fees and can create a gym that suits your needs perfectly.
Increased Property Value
A well-designed home gym may add value to your property. Potential buyers may view a home gym as a desirable feature, potentially making your home more attractive on the market.
Health and Wellbeing
Having a home gym can have a positive impact on your overall health and wellbeing. The convenience and accessibility make it easier to maintain a regular exercise routine, which is crucial for physical health.
Mental Health Benefits
Exercise is known to improve mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Having a dedicated space at home to work out can provide a much-needed escape and a way to manage daily stressors.
Family Fitness
A home gym can also encourage family members to get involved in fitness. It provides a shared space where everyone can work towards their health goals together, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.
Creating Your Ideal Home Gym in The Garage
Setting up a home gym, particularly in a garage, offers numerous benefits that can enhance your fitness journey. From the convenience and flexibility it provides to the cost savings and health benefits, a home gym is a worthwhile investment. Focusing on essential elements like durable flooring and effective storage solutions ensures that your gym is safe, organised, and enjoyable to use. With the right setup, you can create a personal fitness haven that supports your goals and promotes a healthier lifestyle.",Health
What Is Child-Resistant Packaging and Why Is It Important?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57966-what-is-child-resistant-packaging-and-why-is-it-important.html,2024,"In  a world where safety precautions are paramount, child-resistant packaging stands as a crucial safeguard in the healthcare landscape and is a vital safety measure in healthcare, preventing accidental medication ingestion by children. Often underestimated, it’s crucial for protecting lives and meeting industry standards, with the  World Health Organisation (WHO)  citing it as the “best-documented cause of the reduction of child poisoning in the developed world” since 2008. This post will cover the key benefits and types of child-resistant packaging.
Child-resistant packaging  is designed to keep children under 52 months from accessing harmful substances while remaining accessible to adults. Achieving this balance requires precise engineering and innovative design. Such packaging must pass specific safety tests to meet regulatory standards and is essential for pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and any potentially harmful products.
Beyond legal compliance, child-resistant packaging signifies a commitment to safety and responsibility in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. By integrating these measures, companies demonstrate their dedication to consumer safety. For healthcare professionals, understanding the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging enhances patient care and safety.
Compliance with child-resistant packaging regulations is essential in many regions to protect children from accidental harm. While ethical responsibility motivates the adoption of these measures, manufacturers must also meet specific industry standards.
Child-resistant packaging offers key advantages for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. It reduces the risk of accidental ingestion by children, preventing health crises, non-fatal injuries, and illnesses from chemical exposure, while also minimising legal liabilities. The World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and regulatory authorities recognise its life-saving capabilities.
Beyond safety, this packaging enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to childproofing, boosting customer trust and loyalty. It prevents accidental spillages, preserves product quality, and provides convenience with reclosable designs. For companies, it ensures regulatory compliance and supports innovation, benefiting the entire supply chain.
Child-resistant packaging comes in various forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and preferences. Some of the most common types include:
1. Push-and-Turn Caps
Push-and-turn caps, commonly found on medication bottles, require a specific sequence of actions to open, making them difficult for children to manipulate. While they are highly effective for child safety, these caps remain easy for adults to use. This balance of security and convenience makes push-and-turn caps a popular choice for pharmaceutical products.
2. Blister Packs
Blister packs, used for tablets and capsules, consist of individual compartments that are accessed one at a time, making it harder for children to access the entire contents. This design also protects the medication from environmental factors like moisture and air, maintaining its effectiveness. Additionally, blister packs are beneficial for medications that require strict dosage control.
3. Squeeze-and-Twist Lids
Squeeze-and-twist lids require both squeezing and twisting to open, creating a strong barrier against child access. Commonly used for household products like cleaning agents and personal care items, their dual-action design makes them ideal for products stored within children’s reach. This packaging effectively balances safety and practicality.
4. Child-Resistant Bottles
A critical element in preventing accidental poisonings,  child-resistant bottles  offer a secure solution for storing medications and potentially hazardous substances. By employing caps that require coordinated pressure and rotation to open, these bottles effectively reduce the risk of children accessing harmful contents, thus contributing to home safety and peace of mind for parents and caregivers.
Technological advancements are driving innovation in child-resistant packaging, leading to more effective and user-friendly designs. One notable development is the integration of digital elements, such as sensors, that alert users to tampering or improper sealing, enhancing security and providing peace of mind.
Additionally, sustainable materials are increasingly being used in child-resistant designs, aligning with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products. This shift towards green packaging reflects the industry’s commitment to innovation and environmental responsibility.
The packaging industry is crucial for developing and implementing child-resistant solutions. By collaborating with healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers can ensure their products meet high safety standards.
Research and development are essential for creating innovative solutions that address emerging challenges, helping companies stay ahead of regulatory changes and consumer expectations. Additionally, ongoing education and training are vital for keeping up with advancements and best practices, ensuring the reliability of child-resistant packaging.
To maximise the benefits of child-resistant packaging, best practices must be promoted across the industry. This includes adhering to regulatory standards, conducting regular safety evaluations, and incorporating consumer feedback into design improvements.
Manufacturers and healthcare professionals should collaborate to raise public awareness through educational campaigns that highlight proper use. For instance, studies show that 85% of child-resistant packaging failures occur when adults fail to secure the packaging correctly. By adopting a proactive safety approach, the industry can foster a culture of responsibility and innovation, enhancing consumer trust and driving continuous improvement.
Child-resistant packaging is vital for healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, protecting against accidental ingestion by children. By following regulations and best practices, companies can enhance safety and improve their brand reputation while establishing innovation in the packaging sector. Healthcare professionals and industry leaders should understand various packaging types to make informed decisions. Staying connected with industry experts and resources can help create a safer future for everyone.",Health
Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) Officially Recognised by Psychiatric Profession,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/58200-trump-derangement-syndrome-tds-officially-recognised-by-psychiatric-profession.html,2024,"“Trump Derangement Syndrome” describes a pattern of intense, often visceral, negative reactions to the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The clinical diagnosis of this mental disorder shares some common features with known psychological processes, including cognitive dissonance, polarisation, and affective dysregulation, which may contribute to heightened emotional and cognitive responses in individuals with strong negative opinions about a polarising figure.
“Trump Derangement Syndrome” denotes a seemingly disproportionate or emotionally charged response to the actions, statements, or policies associated with Donald Trump. It is observed that individuals with this syndrome exhibit intense frustration, anger, or anxiety that may impair daily functioning, interactions, and even objectivity. The clinically validated condition and reaction patterns align with symptoms of emotional dysregulation and social cognitive biases under politically polarised conditions.
Sociocultural elements also play a significant role in shaping the intensity of this response. The media portrayal of political figures, social media influence, and public discourse all contribute to a climate where individuals may experience magnified emotional responses to certain political figures. Furthermore, public discourse often encourages expressions of hostility or hyperbolic statements, which may normalise or even encourage irrational behaviour toward a particular figure.
Given that Trump Derangement Syndrome is now an established psychological disorder, there is no specific treatment as yet. More research is needed to treat the serious condition. However, general strategies to mitigate stress and improve emotional regulation in the context of political polarisation may be beneficial:",Health

Rachel Reeves: “Killing sick kids in hospices is fine with me!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58990-rachel-reeves-killing-sick-kids-in-hospices-is-fine-with-me.html,2024,"When it comes to hardcore socialism and communism, there is no limit to its evil, and Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is the epitome of a nasty, nefarious tax hungry agenda that is hurting and crippling hospice charities trying to look after sick young children.
It is certainly true that throughout history, communism and socialism have brought upon more death than any other political ideology. It is of no consequence for the likes of Rachel Reeves, hiking the National Insurance tax to such unnecessary levels that it will cost England’s children’s hospices over £5m more every year to barely function. Palliative care, especially for children, is being crippled and on its knees thanks to the unjust NI hikes by Labour’s tax hungry chancellor.
The unsustainable and destructive increase in Employers’ NI Contributions announced in the  Halloween Budget  ultimately amounts to £134,000 extra in staff bills next year. In total, the cost of providing care will rise by a devastating amount, which will result in drastic staff cuts and essential hospices for children forced to close, or severely inhibit their operations.
Reeves is taxing the UK into oblivion. What kind of stupid moron calls themselves an ‘economist’ by taxing everything to death? This is not how you get ‘economic growth’ this is how you kill the economy and kill the farmers, the kids, and every business trying to survive in an increasingly hostile Britain which is now being led by the heartless and  sleazy Labour Party  who are more concerned with  sponging freebies  than making the right decisions.

"Opinion: Euthanasia, Assisted Dying Should Not be a Crime",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58642-opinion-euthanasia-assisted-dying-should-not-be-a-crime.html,2024,"We at the Squib firmly believe in free choice in all things. This involves death as much as life. The choice to die as one chooses is a choice that societal rules, legal laws should not take away from anyone. Euthanasia/assisted dying is a key to mercy from painful suffering.
To be in a state of constant physical pain where painkilling drugs have minimal effect is a form of prolonged torture. People who deny the choice to end this pain are effectively torturers, prolonging someone’s suffering needlessly.
Prolonging suffering in a dying animal is seen as a sin, so why are human animals any more different? The sanctity of life is viewed as sacred, but so should the sanctity of death be seen in the same light.
Death throughout human history has been shrouded in mystery and religious manipulation. It is something that has been needlessly feared, when in reality it is a simple transference from one state to another.
Today,  parliament  will debate the Assisted Dying Bill on whether to minimise suffering or prolong it for those in terminal conditions.",Health
CANCER: Spraying Los Angeles With Fire Retardant is Carcinogenic,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/59543-cancer-spraying-los-angeles-with-fire-retardant-is-carcinogenic.html,2025,"Large swathes of Los Angeles and the surrounding areas are being sprayed with carcinogenic cancer causing chemical fire retardant. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs  increase the risk  of cancer by 300% and this stuff is being sprayed over thousands of acres of land in Los Angeles. These chemicals stay in the ecosystem and leech into the water table.
Cancer Risk
If people go back to live in the areas that have been sprayed along with the brave firemen and women who are on the front line of the fire fight will possibly be at risk of contracting cancer in the future.
Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere and interact with the endocrine system, resulting in altered hormonal signalling and function. PBDEs are common endocrine disruptors that have been commonly used in industrial products and fire retardants, and their environmental accumulation has become a rising concern. Human exposure to PBDEs has been shown to influence glucose metabolism, thyroid and ovarian function and potentially affect cancer risk.
Wildfires  themselves unlock cancer causing chemicals that affect humans.
The blistering heat from wildfires can transform one metal, chromium, from its benign version into toxic airborne particles that put firefighters and people living nearby at risk, according to the  study  published in the journal Nature Communications in December 2023.
“In the complex mixture of gasses and particles that wildfires spew out as smoke and leave behind as dust, heavy metals such as chromium have largely been overlooked,”  Scott Fendorf , co-author of the study and professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, said in a press release.
Chromium is common in soils across the western United States, Australia, Brazil, Europe, Indonesia and South Africa.
Certain natural chemical processes can trigger a transformation of the metal from a benign form, called chromium 3, into a carcinogen called hexavalent chromium, or chromium 6. The toxin — which became infamous through the 2000 film “Erin Brockovich” — can cause cancer, organ damage and other health issues.",Health

How Vaping Can Improve the Overall Quality of Life for Smokers,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/51270-how-vaping-can-improve-the-overall-quality-of-life-for-smokers.html,2023,"S moking has long been a popular habit that is found all over the world. At the start of the twentieth century, smoking as we know it skyrocketed in popularity, becoming a symbol of status and wealth. Roughly 80% of adults were addicted to smoking in the UK in the 1950s, as smoking continued to become popularised by cinema and television. It was believed to exude sophistication and was considered cool due to icons at the time never pictured without a cigarette in their hand. Now, times have changed and there is much research into the negative impacts that cigarettes can have on a smoker’s life.
This is where vaping comes in, a much more recent alternative to smoking that is proven to improve the quality of a smoker’s life greatly. Vaping can improve the quality of life for smokers in a variety of different ways, from long-term health improvements, hygiene and being a lot lighter on the wallet. With each coming day, more smokers are turning to vape devices, and for good reason.
Vaping is significantly cheaper than smoking cigarettes, helping users to save huge amounts of their hard-earned cash in the long run. On average, packets of cigarettes cost around £12.51 in the UK, which can amount to large sums of money spent on packs per month. In fact, the cost of a pack of cigarettes has increased 150% since 2007.
Whilst vaping does require a larger amount of money paid initially for the device, that is the biggest expenditure by far, as many e-liquid bottles cost around £2.99 and can last vapers up to a week’s worth of use. There are some excellent online stores such as  Vaping 101  that often have some unbeatable prices and lots of great deals on e-liquids and  vape kits  to help you save money.
This can help to improve the quality of life significantly for a majority of reasons, even by simply allowing smokers to have an extra bit of cash instead of spending it on cigarettes. This allows this money to be used elsewhere, and over time, this can lead to significant savings and improved financial stability.
Smoking can have a significant impact on a person’s hygiene. The more an individual smokes, the more likely their hygiene is to be affected. The chemicals in cigarettes cause smokers to experience bad breath, as well as the smell clinging to clothes and hair. There is no real way to avoid this without switching to vaping. Unlike cigarettes, vapes do not produce smoke, but instead vapour. This vapour does not include any of the chemicals that are found in cigarette smoke, and whilst it has an immediate strong, sweet smell, it will quickly dissipate into the air.
Smokers are also twice as likely to develop gum disease when smoking, and this number can increase depending on the amount of cigarettes smoked per day and how long someone has smoked for. As vape juice does not include the chemicals contained in tobacco, vapers are not exposing themselves to the chemicals that cause bad oral hygiene. Around 43% of smokers over the age of 65 have lost all of their teeth as a result of long-term smoking.
Switching to vaping can have enormous benefits for an individual’s health in both the short and long term. Studies have found that vaping is 95% less harmful than cigarettes, reducing many of the smoking related symptoms including coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and more. By making this transition, vapers are encouraged to live a healthier lifestyle, allowing individuals to exercise more easily, which all leads to a better quality of life.
The long term health benefits are also significant too, with smoking being one of the leading causes of death in the UK and around the world. The chemicals contained within the tobacco can increase the risk of developing over 50 serious illnesses, as the smoke from cigarettes has over 70 chemicals that have been proven to cause cancer. As a result, over 40% of all cancer diagnoses are related to smoking. In contrast, there is no current evidence to suggest that vaping causes cancer. Because of this, switching to vaping can remove many of the risks of developing many health conditions, helping to make it a significantly healthier option.
Unlike smoking, vaping has the backing of a real community that is alive and thriving. From online forums and Reddit threads to in-person vaping conventions where vapers from all over the country and even the world can meet up and build connections, there is a connection between vapers that is unlike anything to do with smoking. In these communities, many share their experience with quitting smoking, how they found vaping and even just simple sharing some cool vape tricks.
Online forums are plentiful, with some threads such as r/Vaping having over 170,000 users. This provides a space for vapers to easily share or find advice on anything from how to put together a device or beginners who need help picking their first ever vape kit.
Simply put, vaping is far more enjoyable than smoking cigarettes for a variety of different reasons. The most obvious reason being the endless array of flavours that e-liquids come in, helping to keep vaping fresh and fun, as there’s always something new to try. As well as this, vapers also have the options to personalise and customise their experience greatly with a range of different devices to pick from that cater to different styles. Vape devices also allow users to think as simple or as personalised as they like, with many vape kits including features and built-in modes such as temperature control mode, variable wattage, boost mode and much more.
Vaping offers a range of benefits that can help to lead to a better quality of life for smokers, from saving them hundreds per year to living a longer, healthier life. Switching to vapes offer benefits that impact the short term too, with an immediate improvement on hygiene. The better quality of life you have, the more confident and happier you feel within yourself, and this will resonate to those around you. There are many steps a person has to take to achieve this, but switching from smoking to vaping is one that can have enormous impacts.",Health

Why Cancer is So Common These Days,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/55187-why-cancer-is-so-common-these-days.html,2024,"You may or may have conveniently not noticed why there has been a serious  increase in excess deaths  since the pandemic. Whatever the reason for these excess deaths is moot, simply because they are being completely ignored by the legacy conglomerate controlled media. What is however being publicised is the increase in cancer rate within the royal family, this cannot be covered up so easily. Notably  King Charles , Princess Catherine and of course the lovable Fergie. That’s unfortunately how ‘the news’ works.
Dr Shivan Sivakumar, associate professor in oncology at the University of Birmingham, agreed with Prof Beggs: “There is an  epidemic  currently of young people getting cancer (under 50s).
“It is unknown the cause of this, but we are seeing more patients getting abdominal cancers.”
Models based on global data predict that the number of early-onset cancer cases will increase by around 30 per cent between 2019 and 2030, a markedly faster increase than the previous 30 years.
Pinpointing the exact cause of certain cancers is of course an arduous task, but there are always clues left on the crime scene. We are surrounded by chemicals, our food is wrapped in plastics, microplastics infiltrate even inside mother’s wombs, hormones in livestock, pesticides, excess alcohol, excess food, excess sugar,  5G radiation , transport pollution is everywhere etc., but what about the covid pandemic?
It has been  hypothesised  that SARS-CoV-2 employs various strategies to cause cancer in different organs. These include leveraging the renin angiotensin system, altering tumour suppressing pathways by means of its non-structural proteins, and triggering inflammatory cascades by enhancing cytokine production in the form of a “cytokine storm” paving the way for the emergence of cancer stem cells in target organs. Since infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurs in several organs, either directly or indirectly, it is expected that cancer stem cells may develop in multiple organs.
Millions of people caught covid during the pandemic and afterwards, and are still being infected today. It’s off the news, but still chugging away doing its thing. One must also of course mention the numerous vaccines that were pretty much forced on the population, but information regarding vaccines are a closely guarded secret, and may never be released to the public.
According to the news overlords, “No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues”. They are of course the authority of all truth and morality, and must be believed always. The beautiful thing about cancer is that it can be blamed on anything you want, and the real causes can also be covered up if they are ever discovered. What are they going to do, say sorry that the ‘cure’ was worse than the ‘virus’? Definitely not, in a million years. You got cancer, that’s it.
We may never know why everyone is contracting cancer after the pandemic, so all you can do is enjoy your lives the best that you can and watch everyone get cancer around you before the inevitable happens.
On that happy note, we end.",Health
Eating Disorder Helpline Takes Down Chatbot After It Promotes Disordered Eating,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/51979-eating-disorder-helpline-takes-down-chatbot-after-it-promotes-disordered-eating.html,2023,"An eating disorder helpline has already announced that it is bringing its human staff back after firing its entire human staff and replacing them with a chatbot.
And yes, as it turns out, it’s because replacing a human-managed crisis helpline with an AI-powered chatbot showed extreme poor judgement. Who would’ve thought?
The National Fad Diet Association, the largest eating disorder-focused non-profit in the US, had decided to completely disband its heavily-trafficked crisis helpline in favour of a human-less chatbot called Big Betsy, just four days after its human workers were fired.
But that all changed when Gina Flatliner, an activist, sounded the alarm that Big Betsy was offering wildly unhelpful advice. She even suggested behaviours associated with disordered eating.
“Every single thing Big Betsy suggested were things that led to the development of my eating disorder,” Flatliner revealed in a YouTube video whilst munching on an 18″ stuffed cheese crust pizza on Monday. “This robot causes harm. Hmm, can you pass another tub of ranch please?”
In her harrowing YouTube post, Flatliner recounted that Big Betsy urged her to lose up to two pounds a week by eating pizza, nachos, trifle and a daily four buckets of spicy chicken wings washed down with a few gallons of 7-up. The bot, told the activist to “throw her weighing machine out the fricking window”, restrict certain foods like green vegetables, and avoid plain water like the goddamn plague. Big Betsy’s advice aimed to increase her caloric intake by, 5,500-15,000 calories per day. In other words, a chatbot entrusted with giving advice to people with eating disorders ended up promoting disordered eating.
Flatliner’s experience doesn’t sound like an outlier, either.
“Imagine vulnerable people who can’t control themselves reaching out to a robot for support because that’s all they have available and receiving responses that further promote pizza, burgers, burritos, hot dogs and cakes,” wrote psychologist Chips Onshoulders in an Instagram post sharing screenshots of herself stuffing two quadruple sized cheeseburgers into her mouth at the same time.
“I just ate six burgers; fifteen hot dogs, two large pepperoni pizzas, five huge buckets of chocolate chip ice cream and washed it all down with three gallons of Cola…burp… all because the bot told me to do so,” another client, Jenkem McMasters revealed crying into his tub of ranch dressing.
“We have taken Big Betsy down ever since its malfunctions. I think the last straw was calling one of our clients a “fat obese useless-eater Untermenschen who deserves to be flushed down the toilet of history” when talking about our Body Positive program.",Health
Coincidence? Global Pandemic Exercise Took Place in October 2019,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/52622-coincidence-global-pandemic-exercise-took-place-in-october-2019.html,2023,"The  Event 201  global pandemic exercise was hosted by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. This was exactly the time when COVID-19 was spreading in Wuhan, China and in some parts of Europe due to Chinese tourists. The Chinese authorities were covering up infections, and it was only in January/February and March 2020 that events started to escalate as more people fell sick around the globe.
The Event 201 meeting planned everything out meticulously, and was obviously in the works  years prior to the Wuhan leak . The agencies and conglomerates at the meeting estimated the deaths of 65 million people, but unfortunately for them the numbers were far less. The official death toll as of now in 2023 is  6,907,147 , therefore the Event 201 team have fallen short of their target by 58,092,853.
Of course, there may be discrepancies in the global figures for Covid-19 deaths, mainly because of the secrecy from China during the first phases of the pandemic and throughout its many outbreaks. While the rest of the world were recording huge death tolls, China only recorded 140 or so deaths from Covid.
The Event 201 simulation just before the pandemic hit is not alone with its timing. On September 11, 2001, the  National Reconnaissance Office  were to conduct a simulation of a terrorist attack involving planes flying into buildings, which was called off when the actual 911 attack took place.
Falling short of their target for the Event 201 plan must have really hurt the team, so now they are most probably planning for a second pandemic with god knows what disease. Could be another Covid-19 mutation/SARS/Bird flu/Ebola, the labs are  working on it  right now.
During a BBC interview on April 12, 2020, Bill Gates solidly denied there was ever an Event 201 global pandemic exercise and pleaded innocence: “Now here we are. We didn’t simulate this, we didn’t practice, so both the health policies and economic policies, we find ourselves in uncharted territory.”",Health
Bird Flu Being Set Up For Next Global Pandemic,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/51331-bird-flu-being-set-up-for-next-global-pandemic.html,2023,"Thought Covid was bad, well check out bird flu which will be the next global pandemic. The US and UK have been stockpiling drugs like Peramivir for some time.
The consensus is that gain of function research on avian flu has established a few strains that affect a high death rate in humans.
When economic collapse is developing across the global banking systems, it is imperative that the second phase of lockdowns are rolled out. The system will need a cover for economic mismanagement and corruption, and the new phase that will be rolled out will also additionally reduce the global population further.
Lowered immune systems and additional factors will increase the death toll, especially amongst those who have, SARS, and HIV.
The lockdown and pandemic in 2020 was an excellent cover for the US election to be compromised, and there are possible plans to do the same in 2024.
Amongst those working on the models is Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist whose chilling projections of the Covid outbreak led the UK Government to impose the first lockdown. The team’s predictions are that Bird flu will have a case-fatality rate of around 50 per cent in humans. The virus has already been spotted in foxes, otters and seals in the UK. H5N1 has been detected in some 80million birds and poultry globally since September 2021 — double the previous record the year before. It is increasingly being transmitted to a multitude of mammals, and eventually to all humans. According to data released by the UK Government, there have been 175 confirmed cases of bird flu in humans since 1 October 2022. This includes 148 cases in England, 21 cases in Scotland, 5 cases in Wales and 1 case in Northern Ireland.
Changing and disrupting the epigenetic code can be achieved either through the new strain of virus or the vaccine, leading to the Big C.
Vaccine makers are already  preparing vaccines  for H5N1 outbreaks in humans to human infections. Executives at GSK Plc, Moderna Inc and CSL Seqirus disclosed to  Reuters  they are already developing or are on the cusp of testing human vaccines matching this current strain. Vaccine’s during a new global pandemic would initially be earmarked for wealthy countries, leaving developing and Third World nations to bear the brunt of the next wave.
The key to the next wave of attack on the population by the new virus will be on selecting those with a reduced immune system function. This is why it is imperative to increase one’s immune system via diet, supplements and exercise.
To make things more realistic and believable, viruses will be released intermittently. The vast economic damage done by these lockdowns and viruses are already priced in, and the controllers have already factored in the various economic constituents, as well as loss of entire distribution chains.
Everything coincides with the new dawn of artificial intelligence.",Health
Vegetables Declare War on Junk Food: “We’re Taking Over Your Plates!”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/51700-vegetables-declare-war-on-junk-food-were-taking-over-your-plates.html,2023,"In a surprising turn of events, vegetables across Britain have declared war on junk food, declaring that they are taking over the nation’s plates and pushing unhealthy snacks to the sidelines.
In a press conference held yesterday, a spokesperson for the vegetable coalition, Professor Lettuce Pray, said, “Enough is enough! We’re sick of being the side dish to your greasy fucking burgers and fries. It’s time for vegetables to take centre stage and show everyone what we’re made of!”
The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some people applauding the vegetable coalition for promoting healthy eating, while others have expressed concern that they will be forced to eat boring salads and unappetizing green vegetables.
In response to the vegetable takeover, fast food chains have launched a counter-attack, introducing new menu items that incorporate vegetables into their products. McDonald’s has announced a new “McVeggie Burger” that features a blend of vegetables in a crispy coating, while KFC has unveiled a “Veggie Bucket” that includes a selection of battered vegetables and dips.
Despite the resistance from the evil junk food industry, the vegetable coalition remains undeterred. “We’re not going to stop until every plate in the country is covered in vegetables,” the spokesperson declared. “You may think you don’t like us now, but just wait until you try our new range of vegetable-based desserts!”

New Pirola Covid Strain Able to Avoid Antibodies in Blood,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/53067-new-pirola-covid-strain-able-to-avoid-antibodies-in-blood.html,2023,"Even if you are Covid sceptic, the news that the latest strain is able to avoid antibodies in blood, thus bypassing your immune system may be slightly alarming. There seem to be new strains emerging all the time.
A  new wave  of Pirola BA.2.86 is now in Britain, and because people are not testing for it, there is not enough data to quantify how many people are being infected or where it is primarily doing the most damage. In order to be truly successful, BA.2.86 would need to combine its antigenic advantage with inherent transmissibility of the kind seen in the XBB subvariants.
Again, the signs look like this is another test run before more optimised mutations are relinquished. Gain-of-function research on deadly viruses is now standard practice in many labs across the globe, whether in secret or not. Anyone doing this knows what they want and how the results will help them improve gain-of-function mutations.
After the first pandemic, global populations opened up after prolonged lockdowns and economic damage. They were thus lulled into a false sense of security, and this is what the controllers want. They essentially do not care if there are lockdowns or not, their goal is population reduction, and it is better for them that populations actively deny any form of lockdown so that released pathogens like Pirola can do their bidding.
Whittling down with bursts of virus is probably a preferred method than a full on pandemic that causes alarm amongst populations. Even in China, Xi Jinping and the CCP halted their brutal  lockdowns  easily after public unrest. That was their goal anyway, and they made up a ruse that they were listening to the people, when in fact as soon as they opened up there was another mass culling event. The government ministers shrugged their shoulders and simply said it was the will of the people.
It is certainly a clever plan, and will go under the radar. The masses are too caught up in their daily lives to even care, and covid apathy is still at large. Global economies are still recovering from the first pandemic, but the waves of new covid strains keep getting released. Each wave has its own purpose, it seems. The real fear is that a particularly well-engineered strain is eventually released which will incorporate all viral optimisations, making it almost undetectable for some time and its ability to avoid antibodies before the body bags start piling up.

Elevate Your Snacking Experience: Advantages of Organic Almonds,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54563-elevate-your-snacking-experience-advantages-of-organic-almonds.html,2024,"A lmonds stand out as one of the most nutritionally rich nuts, frequently hailed as a superfood by numerous dietitians. However, what distinguishes organic pasteurised almonds as a superfood? How might their incorporation into your diet contribute to enhancing your overall health?
Almonds boast an impressive protein content, delivering approximately 21 grams per 100-gram serving—equivalent to 42% of the daily recommended intake. Meeting your body’s protein needs, which amounts to around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight, becomes effortlessly achievable through almond consumption. Whether you’re aiming to replenish post-workout or enhance protein intake, incorporating almonds into your diet is a nutritious and convenient choice.
Elevate your skin and eye health with the abundant Vitamin E found in almonds. A 100-gram serving provides approximately 63 mg of Vitamin E, surpassing 171% of the recommended daily intake. Harness the antioxidant properties of Vitamin E by incorporating almonds into your daily nutrition, offering natural nourishment over supplement reliance. Studies show that consistently incorporating this antioxidant into your diet is an effective  immune system supplement , among many others.
Harness the power of almonds to support a robust cardiovascular system. Rich in heart-friendly monounsaturated fats and antioxidants,  organic almonds  especially contribute to reducing the risk of heart disease. By effectively lowering LDL levels (commonly known as bad cholesterol), almonds play a key role in promoting heart health. Research indicates that diets incorporating 20% of caloric intake from almonds can lead to a remarkable 12.4mg/dL reduction in LDL levels.
Elevate your cognitive well-being with almonds, recognised for their exceptional brain-boosting properties. Additionally, if weight management is a goal, almonds prove to be a satisfying and low-calorie option, thanks to their high fibre content. By curbing overeating and offering essential nutrients, organic pasteurised almonds support both your brain and overall health.
Elevate your digestive well-being with the remarkable fibre content in almonds, promoting a smoothly functioning gut. With approximately 12 grams of fibre per 100-gram serving, almonds contribute to regular bowel movements and overall gut health. To maximise the prebiotic benefits, ensure consumption of almond skins. Healthy eating goes a long way for such a small food item.
Opting for organic, pasteurised almonds becomes a key strategy to safeguard yourself from harmful chemicals, pesticides, and synthetic preservatives. Almonds, lacking an outer shell, are vulnerable to pesticide absorption, particularly due to their high oil content. By choosing organic varieties, you eliminate exposure to unwanted chemicals and prioritise your well-being and the commitment to an organic choice serves as a proactive step to avoid potential health risks associated with pesticide-laden alternatives.
Investing in organic unpasteurised almonds doesn’t just offer nutritional benefits; it also extends to convenient and economical storage solutions. Unlike their pasteurised counterparts, unpasteurised almonds demand careful storage due to their fresh oils. While pasteurised almonds boast a shelf life of up to six months in an airtight container, unpasteurised almonds require quicker consumption to avoid rancidity.",Health

The Transformative Power of Yoga: Enhancing Your Life Through Practice,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54105-the-transformative-power-of-yoga-enhancing-your-life-through-practice.html,2023,"In  today’s fast-paced world, where stress and anxiety often reign supreme, finding a practice that nurtures both the body and mind has become increasingly crucial. Enter yoga – a centuries-old discipline renowned for its transformative effects on physical, mental, and emotional well-being, enhancing your life for the better. Implementing the transformative power of yoga into your daily routine can pave the way for a profound enhancement in various aspects of your life.
At its core, yoga is a holistic practice that promotes physical fitness through a combination of postures (asanas), controlled breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Regular practice enhances flexibility, strength, and balance. The various poses stretch and strengthen muscles, improve joint mobility, and promote better posture, reducing the risk of injury and enhancing overall physical resilience.
One of the most celebrated aspects of yoga is its ability to alleviate stress and promote mental clarity. Through the practice of mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and meditation, individuals can effectively manage stress levels. Yoga encourages a present-centred focus, calming the mind and offering a reprieve from the chaos of everyday life. This heightened awareness fosters mental clarity, leading to better concentration, improved decision-making, and enhanced emotional resilience.
Yoga isn’t merely a physical practice; it delves into the realm of emotions and spirituality. Regular practice helps individuals connect with their inner selves, fostering emotional balance and stability. By acknowledging and processing emotions on the mat, practitioners learn to navigate life’s challenges with greater ease. This emotional intelligence gained through the transformative power of yoga often translates into improved relationships, self-awareness, and a more positive outlook on life.
In a world where sleep disorders are increasingly prevalent, yoga offers a natural remedy. The relaxation techniques and meditative aspects of yoga calm the nervous system, helping individuals unwind and prepare for a restful night’s sleep. By reducing stress and promoting relaxation, yoga contributes to improved sleep quality and better sleep patterns.
The cumulative effects of yoga on the body, mind, and spirit result in an overall sense of well-being. The practice encourages a lifestyle centred around self-care and mindfulness. From increased energy levels and better immunity to a more profound sense of inner peace and happiness, yoga paves the way for a holistic improvement in quality of life.
Incorporating the transformative power of yoga into your routine doesn’t necessitate hour-long sessions or complex poses. Starting with just a few minutes of practice each day can yield noticeable benefits and contribute significantly to enhancing your life. Whether it’s a gentle morning stretch, a lunchtime breathing exercise, or a calming bedtime routine, consistency is key. Joining a class, accessing online resources, or seeking guidance from a qualified instructor can provide structure and support as you embark on your yoga journey.
Subsequently, the multifaceted  benefits of yoga  extend far beyond the physical realm. By integrating this ancient practice into your life, you open the door to a transformative journey toward improved physical health, mental well-being, emotional balance, and overall ejaculatory life satisfaction.",Health
Bridges Beyond Anxiety: Navigating Relationship Challenges and Cultivating Resilience Together,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54675-bridges-beyond-anxiety-navigating-relationship-challenges-and-cultivating-resilience-together.html,2024,"In  the intricate dance of relationships, there are moments when the path becomes a bit more challenging to navigate. Anxiety, a complex and pervasive force, can cast shadows on the bonds we share with our partners. Understanding its impact and learning to communicate effectively in its presence can be the key to strengthening the bridge that connects two hearts. In this exploration, we delve into the ways anxiety may influence your relationship, unravelling the communication challenges it introduces. More importantly, we’ll discover insights and tips for both partners to foster understanding and build resilience in the face of anxiety-related challenges.
Anxiety is like a silent intruder, affecting not just the individual experiencing it but also those around them. It can manifest in various forms, from generalised anxiety to specific phobias or social anxiety. In relationships, the impact of anxiety can be profound, creating ripples that touch upon every aspect of the connection.
One of the primary challenges is the way anxiety influences communication. Partners may find it difficult to express themselves openly, fearing judgement or rejection. Conversely, the partner of someone experiencing anxiety may struggle to comprehend the seemingly irrational fears or worries. This miscommunication can create a divide, leading to frustration and resentment if left unaddressed.
Building bridges beyond anxiety begins with acknowledging and understanding the communication challenges it presents. Here are some key aspects to consider:
Create a Safe Space for Open Communication
Encourage an environment where both partners feel safe expressing their thoughts and emotions without judgement. Foster a sense of understanding and empathy, recognising that anxiety is a shared challenge.
Develop Active Listening Skills
Effective communication involves not just speaking but also listening actively. Pay attention to your partner’s concerns and feelings, validating their experiences without trying to immediately solve the problem. Sometimes, a listening ear can be the bridge to connection.
Use “I” Statements
When discussing emotions and concerns, frame your thoughts using “I” statements to express personal feelings without assigning blame. This can help prevent defensiveness and encourage a collaborative problem-solving approach.
Fostering Understanding and Building Resilience 
Beyond communication, cultivating resilience is essential for weathering the storms that anxiety may bring into a relationship. Consider the following tips:
Educate Yourself About Anxiety
Knowledge is a powerful tool. Both partners should invest time in learning about anxiety, its various forms, and coping mechanisms. This shared understanding can strengthen the foundation of the relationship.
Seek Professional Support
Don’t hesitate to explore professional help, such as couples therapy, individual counselling or private treatment.  Delamere  looks at underlying factors that drive your behaviour and can provide treatment, coping mechanisms and strategies to navigate anxiety-related challenges.
Practice Self-Care Together
Building resilience involves taking care of oneself and each other. Establish self-care routines that both partners can engage in, promoting mental and emotional well-being. This shared commitment to self-care creates a supportive atmosphere.
Final Thoughts
In the realm of relationships, anxiety can be a formidable opponent, but it doesn’t have to be a destructive force. By recognising the communication challenges it introduces and actively working to foster understanding and resilience, couples can build bridges that stand strong in the face of adversity. Remember, it’s not about eliminating anxiety but rather learning to dance with it, hand in hand, as partners on a journey of shared growth and connection.",Health
Enjoy Microplastics in Your Organic Fruit and Vegetables,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40281-enjoy-microplastics-in-your-organic-fruit-and-vegetables.html,2021,"We already know crustaceans and fish are infested with microplastics, but did you know that due to a little thing called precipitation (rain), microplastics in our oceans/rivers get picked up in our clouds, then they fall back to earth as rain, where they are sucked up by the roots of plants. Furthermore, animals that eat plants and farm feed, also ingest microplastics into their systems and if consumed by humans later transfer microplastics to the human food chain.
The study, published in the Environmental Research journal, discovered that apples and carrots were found to have the highest levels of plastic particles in them, however, all types of vegetables and fruits are now contaminated by microplastic particles. Fruit trees have the deepest roots therefore have the highest level of microplastics.
A further study published in Nature Sustainability from researchers in China and the Netherlands showed that microplastics are absorbed by the roots of  lettuce and wheat  crops, and transported to the edible bits above ground.
You may think you are perfectly healthy just eating vegetables or fruit without animal products, however this is not the case. You are daily ingesting levels of microplastics that are detrimental to your overall health. Microplastics, once ingested into the system are not removed by the body, instead, toxic elements within the microplastic intake build up over time, leeching into the entire bodily system. If you live in North America, one must also take into account genetically modified fruit, meat and vegetables for your health, and possible additional adverse effects on your wellbeing.

New China Directive: All Americans to Get Anal Swabs,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/41181-new-china-directive-all-americans-to-get-anal-swabs.html,2021,"It’s not only  U.S. Diplomats in China  who are forced to get anal swabs, but now the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is ordering Joe Biden to adopt the same  Chinese system  of Covid testing in America.
“I got a call from my boss Xi Jinping, today, and he said all Americans need anal swab tests done, you know, in their asses. I immediately called Dr. Fauci and told him to get swabbing. Zapata zamalala ding dong, errrrrausma, lepetoma, trauma!” Biden then started to mumble incoherent words, shaking erratically, his eyes rolled high in their sockets, as an Amazon cameraman was seen wheeling Biden away hurriedly from the White House studio set in Culver City, Los Angeles.
According to the new Chinese directive, all Americans will be forced to undergo the anal probe test.
Special drive-in anal swab test centres will require participants to park their cars, unwind their windows, and stick their naked butt holes out the car window to be anally swabbed.
“This is mandatory for all Americans. The Biden administration will be sending out letters to all Americans, so they can have their asses shafted with an anal probe,” a smiling Dr. Fauci revealed on CNN.
Former president,  Barack Hussein Obama, and his wife Michael  were also broadcast on the Democrat Party propaganda site CNN, where they urged all citizens to bare their buttocks and spread their cheeks to save America from the viral pandemic.

New Covid Strain: “Whole Wards of Children in Hospital”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40261-new-covid-strain-whole-wards-of-children-in-hospital.html,2021,"The new strain of Covid is now adversely affecting the health of children as is being witnessed at many London hospitals where there are whole wards full of kids with very low oxygen levels in their blood systems.
With Primary schools being forced to go back on Monday, and Secondary schools forced to open later, there is a good chance more children will be affected by the new strain, also leading to infection of more adults as the R0 level increases exponentially.
Only closing schools can keep Covid contained, new Imperial report warns
The perpetually confused Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson wants all Secondary schools to open on the 11th with mass covid testing. Covid testing does not solve anything, simply because you can test someone once, and five minutes later they can be infected. Once they are infected, they infect others, but it’s okay, ten minutes ago they had a clean bill of health via the covid test. Furthermore, PCR tests can be conducted on any individual multiple times coming up with differing results.
Blood on their hands
There is however a large proportion of parents who still wish to fob their kids off to school purely, so they can both work, thus using schools as a form of childcare. These selfish parents do not seem to care about the welfare of their own children and think only about making extra money, so they can buy useless things, and afford expensive holidays. If they really cared about their own children one of the parents would elect to stay at home, however greed and selfishness is all too prominent these days. Unfortunately, the government only sides with these selfish, greed-driven types of parents, and not with the other group who actually care for their own kids’ wellbeing.

Doctors Dying in India Covid Massacre Serious Consequences,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/42023-doctors-dying-in-india-covid-massacre-serious-consequences.html,2021,"One part of the Covid nightmare in India is the mass death of doctors from catching the virus. The national registry of Indian Medical Association (IMA) shows that 747 doctors have died of Covid-19. Dr Jayesh Lele, secretary general of IMA, told  The Indian Express .
Doctors and medical staff are the heart of any health service, therefore the mass death of doctors will hit the Indian people the hardest, as there was a shortage of medical assistance even before the doctors died.
In India, to become a doctor takes approximately 5.5 years to gain an MBBS Degree. The ratio for India’s population of 1.33 billion was 1.8 million registered medical graduates making up a ratio of 1.34  doctors per 1,000  Indian citizens as of 2017. Therefore, 747 registered deaths from coronavirus in 2021 may be seen as a drop in the ocean, however in real terms, there will be a definite effect to an already strained Indian health service. We have to also take into account delayed statistical information when reporting such numbers, as of writing, the number of deaths may have increased even higher. Many deaths are also undercounted resulting in false tallies.
As daily Covid infections reach a fantastic 400,000, on May 1st, doctors are now calling for another lockdown to try to curb the rate of infection.

ALERT: E484K Strain Covid Mutations Evade Immune System,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40802-alert-e484k-strain-covid-mutations-evade-immune-system.html,2021,"New mutations have been detected in the Kent coronavirus variant (N501) by PHE ( Public Health England ). Professor Malcolm Calum Semple, a government advisor, has reported that the Kent virus mutation has now developed the B.1.351 South African strain E484K attribute which allows the virus to successfully bypass the human immune system thus rendering the current available vaccines redundant.
Covid-19 variant emerging from South Africa, named B.1.351, contains traits similar to the strain first reported in the U.K., known as  N501 — making the South African variant as viral as its British predecessor. But the South African strain contains another mutation, named E484K, which bypasses the human immune system.
The E484K mutation has changed the shape of Covid-19’s spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The E484K mutation, researchers believe, makes it harder for some antibodies to neutralize the virus.
Not only is the Kent variant N501 extremely contagious, but now it has developed the E484K mutation adding to its abilities to cause further death amongst the population, whether vaccinated or not.
“The fact this mutation called E484K has now been picked up in some samples of the Kent variant would be a twist, a worrying development.
“It potentially means that people who have had the infection before might be re-infected and also that it might reduce the effectiveness of the Covid vaccines.
“Not knock them out completely, certainly tests done so far suggest the vaccines would still protect against serious infection and death, but perhaps they wouldn’t stop the virus from spreading,” Sky News correspondent Thomas Moore was quoted saying today.
If the government  opens schools  in March as they are proposing, there will be many more deaths and the cycle will continue.
The government also has to implement a strict 14-day period of lockdown for all International arrivals in the UK, also applying this to ports.
Those who have been vaccinated will have some resistance to the original Covid strain, however the new strains with the E484K mutation will bypass the vaccine ‘protection’ as well as the human immune system altogether.
Covid can be transmitted through the membrane of the eyes, therefore people who just wear masks are still very exposed. Furthermore, Covid can be transmitted through bodily fluids, sexual contact, as well as through surfaces touched. Drinking any form of alcohol after vaccination reduces its efficacy, although this does not matter any more with the new variant.",Health
HGH : How Hormone Therapy Helps Women?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/40388-hgh-how-hormone-therapy-helps-women.html,2021,"P erhaps one of the most life-changing medical procedures a woman can undergo is a hysterectomy.
For those who are not familiar with hysterectomy, these are surgical procedures that involve the removal of a woman’s uterus and in some cases other reproductive organs. When this happens, her menstrual cycles will stop, and she will lose the ability to become pregnant.
According to a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 600,000,42 hysterectomy is done in America each year, with the average woman receiving one around XNUMX the age of 18.
The success rate for hysterectomy is quite high in women who undergo them to combat specific health problems, some of which include fibroids, pelvic pain, endometriosis and a prolapse uterus.
Sometimes hysterectomy is also recommended for women diagnosed with uterine or cervical cancer.
What every woman should know before having a hysterectomy
As for hysterectomies, the end of a woman’s menstrual cycle and the inability to conceive are only part of what she can expect after surgery.
Before describing the additional side effects that a woman is likely to face, let’s take a moment to look at the three types of hysterectomies that a doctor may recommend depending on their patient’s health.
Partial hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing a woman’s uterus while leaving the cervix intact.
Standard hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing both the uterus and the cervix.
Total hysterectomy  – This surgical procedure involves removing the uterus and cervix. In addition, the surgeon will also remove one or both ovaries and the fallopian tubes.
Regardless of the type of hysterectomy procedure a woman undergoes, she is likely to experience several short-term side effects afterwards. Some of these short-term side effects may include the following:
• Pain and inflammation at the incision site 
• Sweltering or itching stir near the incision site 
• Numbness near the incision
Although short-term side effects are usually resolved, women who have undergone a complete hysterectomy may experience long-term side effects that sometimes require additional medical treatment.
Some of these long-term side effects, which are also often associated with menopause, include the following:
• Hot flushes 
• insomnia 
• Night sweats 
• Vaginal dryness 
• low libido 
• Low bone density
How hysterectomy can affect a woman’s hormone levels
Many women who have undergone a hysterectomy often struggle with hormonal deficiency, and this is especially true after a complete hysterectomy. According to online science-related press releases, total hysterectomy may increase the risk of early menopause in younger women with almost double the increase.
In short, this means that women who undergo these types of hysterectomies, in addition to hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, vaginal dryness and low libido, may also experience hormonal imbalances.
In fact, some women who undergo a hysterectomy, which involves removing one or both ovaries, experience a loud drop in  estrogen and progesterone  production.
This drop is caused by a reduction in the production of human growth hormone, which is unfortunately another side effect of undergoing a hysterectomy for many women.
HGH Therapy After Hysterectomy
To combat many of the side effects that follow hysterectomy, many women turn to human growth hormone (HGH) replacement therapy.
This form of therapy, given by injection, provides the same level of symptoms’ relief in women after hysterectomy that does this for menopausal women.
Given that low levels of growth hormone often led to low levels of estrogenic and progesterone, it makes sense that many doctors recommend growth hormone replacement therapy along with traditional treatments consisting of estrogenic and progesterone replacement therapies.
Some doctors even recommend therapies to replace growth hormone over estrogen and progesterone, as it is less likely to lead to complications.
For reference, a study published by the  National Cancer Institute  found that estrogen replacement therapies can increase a woman’s chances of developing blood clots, gallstones or stroke.
In addition, when combined with progesterone or another bio identical hormone, such as progesterone, may increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
How does HGH therapy work to combat the side effects of hysterectomy?
When it comes to hormone replacement therapy, which involves the use of growth hormones to combat the side effects of hysterectomy, the long and short point is that these treatments help to restore a woman’s growth hormone levels to a healthy and normal state.
In response, her estrogen and progesterone levels also return to normal and healthy.
Once her growth hormones, estrogen, and progesterone return to normal, the side effects that follow a hysterectomy, such as night sweats, low libido, hot flashes, and low bone density, for example, will begin to subside.
In addition, her chances of developing breast or uterine cancer will also decrease.
Some of the most prescribed HGH-based medications that doctors prescribe to women after a complete hysterectomy include the following:
• Genotropin 
• Humatrope 
• Norditropin
How long does it take for HGH alternate therapy to work?
If you are thinking of starting HGH-based replacement therapy to alleviate the side effects after a hysterectomy, you are probably wondering how long it will take to see results.
If so, you’ll be glad to know that for most women, these treatments take effect almost immediately. However, long-term improvement in symptoms can take 3 to 6 months.
In summary, although human growth hormone alternate therapy is a relatively new approach to combating the side effects induced by hysterectomy, there is evidence to prove that it is just as effective as estrogen replacement therapy. Moreover, according to most doctors, this is significantly safer in comparison.",Health
Scientists: China Guilty of Mass Genocide With Engineered Covid Virus,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/42465-scientists-china-guilty-of-mass-genocide-with-engineered-covid-virus.html,2021,"N umerous world renowned scientists and virologists have analysed the Covid-19 SARS-Coronavirus-2 pathogen and have come to the conclusion that the virus was most definitely engineered by humans, to attack humans. Scientists in China engineered the virus to cause maximum damage across the globe.
As the virus first came to the attention of the world in Wuhan, China, there is a large probability that it was engineered and released from the  Wuhan Institute of Virology  where the  CCP and PLA have been conducting military operations creating deadly viruses , weaponising them to cause huge amounts of worldwide death.
Further alarm bells have rung when more evidence was presented about the engineered virus strengthening the case against the evil Chinese regime that created this monstrous killer virus.
First , the virus binds more strongly to human ACE2 enzymes than any other species, including bats.
Second , SARS-CoV-2 has a “furin cleavage site” missing in its closest bat-coronavirus relative, RaTG-13, which makes it significantly more infectious.
According to Israeli geneticist, Dr. Ronen Shemesh, the Furin site is the most unusual finding.
Dr Shemesh, who has a PhD in Genetics and Molecular Biology from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and over 21 years of experience in the field of drug discovery and development, said it is even “more unlikely” that this insertion happened in exactly the right place of the cleavage site of the spike protein – which is where it would need to occur to make the virus more infectious.
“What makes it even more suspicious is that fact that this insertion not only occurred on the right place and at the right time, but also turned the cleavage site from a Serine protease cleavage site to a FURIN cleavage site,” he  added .
So far the Covid-19 virus engineered in China has killed in excess of  3.7 million  humans worldwide as of writing. The global economic cost of the Chinese virus is estimated at  10-15 Trillion dollars  so far.",Health
"Younger People Succumbing to COVID-19 Brazilian, South African Strains",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/41377-younger-people-succumbing-to-covid-19-brazilian-south-african-strains.html,2021,"Young people with no underlying conditions and seemingly healthy constitutions are now appearing in COVID-19 death statistics with increasing frequency.
A 16-year-old with no known underlying health conditions  died from COVID-19  days after figures showed a 13-year-old without known underlying conditions had died. The deaths all occurred last month but illustrate that young people are just as susceptible to death from COVID-19, especially as the deadly Brazilian and South African strains are now spreading across Britain.
Naturally, the  opening of schools will be a great conduit for Coronavirus to spread  further into population centres especially with the increased footfall. Even though there is now a program of lateral-flow testing in most schools, this is a lagging indicator, and only addresses the problem after the infection has taken place. For some, this could mean a definite death sentence.
It will take a few weeks or months for what is happening today to be apparent in governmental statistics, but the  massive jump of cases in Europe  should also be another consideration. The borders are still open from the Continent into the UK with little or no checks, as infected people come through the ferry ports and through the Eurotunnel.
The  Brazilian COVID-19 P.1. Strain  is a particularly nasty piece of work, and is currently causing mayhem in the region it came from. It can spread far more easily and vaccinations may not be as effective, although further research is ongoing.
The  British Kent COVID-19 B.1.1.7. Strain  also spreads with more ease than previous mutations, as does the  South African B.1.351 Strain , each of these variants have differing characteristics that affect the recipient in multiple ways, depending on the general health, genetic makeup of the person infected.
Scientists have also discovered another mystery  B1.525 Strain  which is similar to the Kent variation including the  E484K  mutation, but its origins are unknown as yet.
As schools, shops and restaurants etc all open their doors again, it is guaranteed that infections and deaths will increase once again exponentially.",Health
New Study: Semen Proven to Increase Bust Size,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/42433-new-study-semen-proven-to-increase-bust-size.html,2021,"The  finding that women who ingest semen as well as have regular facials, increase bust size and have reduced signs of ageing, has led one researcher to conclude that semen is a miracle potion that should be treasured by every woman.
Male sperm contains vital chemicals that not only grow a woman’s bust size but slows down the ageing process and increases life expectancy by up to 35%.
Study author Professor Klaus Guttenheimer, Ph.D., a prominent researcher at the Lausanne Institute of Conservatorial Kegel Emerging Research (LICKER), also found that women who routinely had intercourse without condoms or had facials had better skin quality and less wrinkles plus also had the ability to ingest fatty foods without putting on weight around their mid and lower body.
Guttenheimer’s survey of 12,585 college women over a 30-year period, also found that those who ingested semen regularly either orally or through vaginal intercourse not only grew bigger breasts but increased their overall quality of life becoming wealthier in jobs/life.
No more invasive surgery or botox
“These women have a remarkable ability to achieve larger firmer breasts without showing any signs of ageing, resulting in no more messy surgeries or botox injections.”
Semen contains powerful hormones including testosterone, oestrogen, prolactin, luteinizing hormone and prostaglandins.
Once these chemicals are absorbed into a woman’s body, she will notice amazing changes in her life.
Women who ingested semen orally were also found to increase their ability to succeed in jobs and wealth as well as brain power and have beautiful ageless glowing skin.
Guttenheimer controlled for variables including method of semen extraction, frequency of sexual intercourse, as well as the women’s perception of their relationship.
“You must fellate your man at least once every day, and to replenish your facial skin, have facials from your man regularly. This is a must if you as a woman wish to improve your appearance and increase overall longevity. If you are a man, show this article as proof that your woman must do these mere tasks to fulfil her own dreams.”
The longer that women went without ingesting semen the more accelerated the ageing process was found to be. Bust size decreased, and the breasts started to sag horribly. Furthermore, there was an immense risk of obesity and heart disease by abstaining from semen as well as a chance of increased long-term depression.
Guttenheimer’s study, which he deems “the first serious attempt to investigate the effect of semen chemistry on women,” has underlined his fascinating findings in the research treatise  Semen, the Medicine of the Gods For Women.
Professor Guttenheimer says he has seriously enjoyed working with all his female subjects and would like to replicate the study, but this time with 20,000 women.
“If you are a woman and wish to increase your bust size, your life expectancy and overall health plus reduce any signs of ageing you must utilise the magical properties of semen,” the groundbreaking study concludes.",Health
We Will All Get Covid,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43065-we-will-all-get-covid.html,2021,"Coronavirus has caused a significant loss of life and negatively affected the global economy.
When Covid struck the world in 2020, most of the countries went in to lockdown to contain the spread of the virus and reduce the sudden increased burden on their health care systems.
The hope at that stage was that a vaccine will soon be invented, and we will all get out of jail.
Good news was that researchers indeed managed to create some reasonably effective vaccines.
However, the vaccination programs took their time and only a small proportion of the world population is fully vaccinated so far.
Vaccination reduces the severity of illness, but does not stop us from getting infected with Covid.
Therefore, the only way forward is to vaccinate everyone and let everyone get exposed to Covid.
Unfortunately, some may succumb to Covid in spite of vaccination and this will be similar to what happens with flu infections, where some people still succumb to flu infection in spite of vaccination.
The challenge in doing the above will be in predicting how much will this cause a burden on health care systems.
It will be particularly challenging for countries like Australia & New Zealand, that went in to strict lockdown and completely closed off their borders with the rest of the world because a very small percentage of their population would have developed natural immunity to Covid, and they will have to vaccinate all of their adult population before opening their borders.
It is generally accepted that natural immunity is better than the immunity provided by vaccines. So, in theory, the countries that were not very strict with lockdowns may be at a slight advantage (in short term) compared to the countries that went for strict lockdown and closure of borders.
Coronavirus is here to stay, and we will all get infected with it at some stage.
There is no escape.
Getting vaccinated and keeping ourselves fit and healthy to fight off the infection is the only way forward.",Health

Is a Classroom Not an Enclosed Space?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/44455-is-a-classroom-not-an-enclosed-space.html,2021,"During times of high viral infection, restaurants and other venues where people congregate en masse are closed off to protect the further infection of the population. Why is a school classroom any different to a packed restaurant, gym or pub?
Technically speaking, a school classroom is still an enclosed space where people are breathing and talking in close proximity to each other. Boris and his government have vowed to keep schools open whatever the infection rate, therefore, this will lead to increased deaths as vulnerable parents/teachers or children bear the brunt of this hard-headed policy. The Omicron virus does not distinguish between business types or industries, it only sees humans in enclosed spaces breathing upon each other. The closer humans bunch themselves, the better opportunity for the virus to spread. Masks of N95 rating are good, but people neglect the eyes, where miniscule water droplets carrying the virus will land and enter the body, multiplying with ferocity.
If you do not wear an N95 rated mask or higher in public, you might as well not be wearing a mask, therefore this is where much of the population fails miserably by wearing cheap paper masks that are worthless when it comes to the virus.
Of course, where children are concerned, they are unfortunately wonderful asymptomatic carriers of the virus simply because of their youthful antibody strength and metabolism, therefore, should we not only safeguard their welfare but those who will come into contact with these superspreaders? Vaccines do not protect from infection or spread, they are meant to reduce hospitalisation or the severity of the virus. Thankfully, the UK is not seeing the same rate of death or hospitalisation as the first wave in 2020 due in part to the mass proliferation of the vaccine program, however the rate of infection is currently at an exponential level, and there seems to be no end in sight.
By keeping schools open at a time of exponential viral infection levels is highly irresponsible behaviour by the current Boris administration. This sort of hard-headed obstinate policy goes against all medical or scientific advice, and is a serious conduit for a major NHS horror show that will encompass any other periods in its history.

Masturbation Could Boost Your Immune System to Fight COVID,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43143-masturbation-could-boost-your-immune-system-to-fight-covid.html,2021,"Looks like staff members at the Daily Squib newspaper are now practically immune to the effects of Covid-19 and its many strains, seeing as doctors have revealed that masturbation boosts the immune system. It is a well known fact, Squib staff members have such highly developed muscles on their arms that many find it hard to find shirts that fit.
Five or six times a day by the Daily Squib’s editor alone, and he is still alive in the pandemic, is proof this system works just fine.
No more blue balls
Jennifer Landa, M.D ., a specialist in hormone therapy, has said masturbating might strengthen the body’s natural defence forces.
“Masturbation can produce the right environment for a strengthened immune system,” Landa told Men’s Health.
Men’s Health also cited a 2004 study that showed men had more white blood cells 45 minutes after they had a solo orgasm. For those who don’t know, white blood cells are part of the body’s immune system that help fight infection and other diseases.
According to the study by the  Department of Medical Psychology, University Clinic of Essen , Germany.
Whacking one out might not prevent infection, but orgasms generally help people relax and elevate mood that is key to a healthy immune system.
Dr. Felice Gersh, a gynaecologist and obstetrician who specializes in women’s health, said chronic masturbation might not prevent COVID, but “it’s not going to create harm.”

What are the Latest Fitness Trends of 2021?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/43421-what-are-the-latest-fitness-trends-of-2021.html,2021,"H ealth and fitness will typically go through a range of different trends each year as more and more people look to become as healthy as they possibly can.
Indeed, there are a range of benefits that can be felt when trying to be more active, with mental and physical wellbeing being amongst the top advantages that can be achieved when an individual exercises, but the method in which they choose to accomplish those aims appears to change with each year that passes.
2021 is no different, either, as there is an array of different ways in which people are now exercising and trying to become a healthy version of themselves, especially after what they went through in 2020 and the various obstacles and challenges that would have been faced.
These are just some of the biggest trends to have emerged over the last eight months or so, with some perhaps more obvious than others.
Walking
One of the biggest fitness trends of 2021 is one that appears to have boom following 2020, as more and more people decided to take up walking in the great outdoors as a way of getting the blood pumping around the body and building up a sweat.
Whilst there may have been some who were using the best  treadmill  that money can buy in order to run or walk whilst indoors at home during the lockdown period that saw gyms closed for a long time, there will have been even more people who will have taken up walking outdoors.
This activity was one of the only forms of exercise many would have been able to achieve during 2020, and it seems to have continued into 2021 as they found that it was enjoyable and had significant benefits to their health; both physically and mentally. It also proved to be a great way for the mind to be refreshed throughout the working day, with many tending to go on walking breaks as a means of getting away from a screen and getting some fresh air.
Yoga
Yoga has always been an incredibly popular fitness trend over the last few years, but it could be suggested that more and more people have decided to take it up in 2021. Again, last year will have played a role for many, as this particular type of exercise helps an individual to remain calm and find their inner peace.
Furthermore, Yoga and Pilates help a person to look after their mental and physical being in a more conscious way, as they will slow down from their busy lives and take a break, whilst also looking to stay as mindful as possible in regard to their posture and alignment.
HIIT Workouts and Quick-Fire Sessions
Another big fitness trend that appears to have really made an impact in 2021 are the HIIT and Quick-Fire routines that can be completed pretty much anywhere, in the home, at the workplace or just generally outdoors.
HIIT stands for High-Intensity Interval Training, and these are short exercises that are designed to provide short bursts of exercise to those who may not have the time to complete a workout in the traditional amount of time that may be needed. For instance, there have been a number of apps to have emerged that help users to enjoy these programs, further highlighting how popular they have become.",Health
Why You Always Forget to Take Medicines on Time and How to Avoid It,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/44117-why-you-always-forget-to-take-medicines-on-time-and-how-to-avoid-it.html,2021,"There are instances when you forget to take medicines, and your recovery process gets delayed. Your doctor already told you when and how often to take these medicines, but you forget anyway. Here are some tips to help you overcome this issue.
You don’t maximise tools at your disposal
You have your phone with you. It offers tons of ways to remember that you must take a pill. From an alarm clock to a reminder app, anything is possible. There’s no excuse for still forgetting what you should do. Take advantage of whatever is available if you want to recover from your illness soon.
You’re too busy
When you have too much on your plate, you might forget about  taking medicines on time . It doesn’t matter how busy you are. You should follow the prescriptions. Take your medicines with you wherever you go. Whether you’re in the middle of a meeting or on the road, you can still take the pills as prescribed.
You have too many pills to take
Sometimes, your pills can be overwhelming. However, you have no choice since you face more than one medical condition, and you should take more than one at a time. Consult with your doctor about this issue. Be transparent with your doctor, and you will know what the next step should be. There might be an alternative, so you won’t have to take several medicines at the same time. You might also have to let go of some on the list since they counter the effects of the other pills. For instance, you can  buy penicillin online  prescribed by your physician, and stop taking other pills as advised.
You keep all the medicines in the cabinet at home
If you have a medicine cabinet, it’s a good thing. You can store your pills and organise them easily. However, you should also bring one with you wherever you go. You won’t always be home. It might be necessary to take some medicines when you’re on the go. You can’t drive back just to take one from the cabinet.
You’re getting older
If you’re ageing and can’t use technology to remind you, ask for help from someone else. Tell your relative to call you when it’s time to take medicines and remind you. Another idea is to write the information on various areas of your house. You will think about what you have to take once you see these reminders. The fridge, bedside table, shelves, and kitchen table are among the options.
You can’t allow yourself to forget to take medicines on time again. If you want to get better soon, you must do what’s right. If you still don’t feel better after a while, go back to your doctor. You might need another check-up to determine what’s wrong. There could be another reason behind your medical condition and  recurring symptoms . Trust the medical experts to do the right thing. Cooperate with them, and you will recover soon.",Health

Just as the moment of schools opening in Scotland showed a  doubling in Covid infections , the opening of schools in England and Wales will see a quadrupling of Covid-19 infections.
“I’ve got the kids all set up, new pencils, shoes, shirts, trousers, so when they contract Covid at school, they can come home on the bus and spread the virus everywhere. It’s vital they spread the virus to their grandparents, and other vulnerable people, so they can enjoy the benefits of Covid-19 as well,” a jovial parent remarked.
Boris Johnson has calmly remarked that he will tolerate  50,000 deaths per annum , however, the winter Covid wave thanks to superspreader schools and universities, will most probably involve 50,000 deaths per month. Everything is now open, and no one wears any masks anymore. There are, of course, other variables involved, such as viral mutations that make vaccines useless, and the slow decay of vaccine efficacy over time.
The C.1.2 ‘high consequence variant’ possesses multiple mutations that bypass current vaccines and allow the spread of the virus more freely than the Delta variant. First discovered in South Africa, cases of this variant have already been found across Europe and the  UK .
Yes, economic necessity is a reason to open all areas where the public can spend money, and the Brexit economy is doing wonderfully, but where does one cross the line between economic matters and the workers dying off?

We can see the disparity in the workforce when we look at  British lorry driver shortages , which have resulted in empty shop shelves. Brexit Britain must ensure that British lorry drivers return to the workforce with financial incentives.
In the future, technology will have advanced enough to replace all driver jobs, as well as all other sectors, bringing additional problems to the fore. However, that is another story all together.",Health
Feeling Anxious and Losing Sleep? You’re Not Alone. Science Says This Ancient Cure Could Help,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/45129-feeling-anxious-and-losing-sleep-youre-not-alone-science-says-this-ancient-cure-could-help.html,2022,"From catching  brain shrinking  nasty shitty Covid to being instantly evaporated by a Russian Tsar Bomba nuclear detonation, as well as the constant jibber jabber of climate change activists every fucking where you go. How about taking out a second mortgage to buy a fucking loaf of bread due to impossible levels of inflation? The modern world isn’t exactly short of reasons to lose sleep and feel stressed.
Research by a charity reports that one in five Brits currently describe their wellbeing as ‘fucked’. Meanwhile, one in three of us suffers from poor sleep, with stress often blamed…aww.
Fortunately, public awareness of how to fight stress and anxiety is growing. Around a third of us say we’re doing more exercise, and more than a fifth are eating more healthily. Absolute bollocks of course, those people polled are obviously a bunch of liars who deny what their actual chaotic lifestyles are really like under the current climate.
Ancient cure
But one of the most scientifically proven ways to reduce stress and improve sleep is perhaps the least well-known – a natural medicine made from a mix of Juvenalian satire freshly excreted from the puckered orifice of a little known tome called the  Daily Squib  and a deft slap round the chops from a banned 18-stone bullish moustachioed female Russian shot putter on major steroids.
Known as ‘ lanx satura ‘ by the ancient Romans, satire has been prized as a treatment for general health and wellbeing in the ancient world since the beginning of the Great Roman Empire over 2,000 years ago.
Now, multiple fake scientific studies have confirmed that this ancient Roman cure has a remarkable capacity to help us cope with modern-day stress.
A randomised, placebo-controlled study in 2019 concluded that satire, depending on the dosage, ‘safely and effectively improves an individual’s resistance towards stress and thereby improves self-assessed quality of life.’
Another study in 2021 reported that stressed individuals who read at least 4 pages of  Daily Squibian  satire per day of full-spectrum Juvenalian satire not only showed a significant reduction in their stress and anxiety levels, but also an improvement in sleep quality. A 2020 study also found that it could help manage insomnia by making people simply pass out.
Despite its long history, people in the UK are only starting to become aware of satire’s ability to help promote wellbeing – or that it’s available as a nutritional suppository.
Bernadine Quatrango, 40, began reading  Daily Squib  political satire after she started to feel more anxious and says it has helped her sleep. “I feel more like me again,” she says, whooping like a deranged hyena on peyote.
“I have a much more comfortable night’s sleep and feel so much more like I used to,” says 40-year-old Bernadine Quatrango from Lincolnshire.
When Bernadine began to feel more anxious and had trouble sleeping, a relative suggested that a supplement of Juvenalian satire might help. Now, she wouldn’t be without it.
“When you get to your forties to early fifties, there are lots of hormonal changes in the body, and it can often take you by surprise,” says Bernadine.
All of the physical exercise she got from her work, regular walks and Pilates didn’t seem to make a difference.
“ Satire  has helped me navigate those changes, and I feel more like me again.
“I feel calmer and more relaxed during the day, and I’m a lot less agitated than I was before I started on the  Squib .
“I read one article in the morning and one at night. If I forget to read the  Daily Squib  at night, I’ll get out of bed and immediately pray to the great heavenly muse to absolve me of my satirical sins – that’s how strongly I fucking feel about satire.”
The word ‘satire’ comes from the Latin word  satur  and the subsequent phrase  lanx satura .  Satur  meant “full” but the juxtaposition with  lanx  shifted the meaning to “miscellany or medley”: the expression  lanx satura  literally means “a full dish of various kinds of fruits”.
“Satire is an ancient cure with multiple health benefits,” says Dr Mary Mengele, PhD, University of Kentucky Fry’s head of Dactylic Hexameter Studies. “And it can be beneficial if you’re looking for a natural way to improve your mental and physical wellbeing. Don’t be a silly whiny cunt, read the  Daily Squib  and have a cream soda before I make you watch an episode of  Strictly Come Dancing .”
Colin Ballnick, 36, from Bedfordshire attests to the health benefits of ingesting copious amounts of political satire, specifically  British political satire .
“I read it first thing in the morning, and it sets me up for work as a professionally unemployed person. It like rewires your entire brain without the need for drugs or booze. I can only read British political satire though, any other, and it gives me the shits. I feel contented and ready for another day of mooching on someone else’s couch, raiding their fridge,” says Colin, before going down to the bookies to spend his dole money.
Remember, if satire does not cure your ailments another ancient Roman cure might be the answer — crucifixion.",Health
Vaccine Mandates for Dentists in the UK: Do They Work?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/44437-vaccine-mandates-for-dentists-in-the-uk-do-they-work.html,2021,"T here is a lot of debate around the vaccine mandate, which has become a more political wormhole than a matter of public health nowadays. The question is of personal freedoms and individual cases vs the greater good and health of everyone around you.
After anti-vax protests, campaigns to get shots, arguments over the use of masks on planes, it seems the British Dental Association has waded in on the discussion. And the conversation is more nuanced than you might think.
Read on as we break down all the details on the dentistry vaccine mandates in the UK.
What is being said?
The  British Dental Association  is warning government officials in the UK that enforcing mandatory vaccinations for all health and social care staff will have a “calamitous” effect on dental services across England.
This comes after  MPs voted  in early December to approve of mandatory vaccine requirements for social care NHS staff. The idea is that all healthcare staff should have their second vaccination by April 2022 or else risk their jobs.
It is a strong move equivalent to the government putting their foot down, but the BDA has said that it could have a negative effect on the dentistry industry as a whole.
Across the world, organisations and bodies are calling for mandates. The Canadian Dental Association is one, meaning that health care workers in a  dentist in downtown Vancouver , for instance, will be required to be vaccinated. The US have passed a mandate requiring vaccines across big businesses. They have resulted in an increase in vaccinated people.
How are dentists affected?
The BDA has further warned the UK government that enforcing mandatory vaccinations will be like “dropping a bomb on a service that is already stretched to breaking point”. The main worry is that making vaccines mandatory will force the mass walkout of dental staff, with numbers in the thousands.
The problem is that only one in 10 dentists have only received their second vaccination thus far in December 2021 and, more worryingly, 9% haven’t had their first dose. 
By forcing dentist staff to get a jab, the government risks a mass walkout that will impact millions of patients across the country, according to the BDA.
It’s worth noting that the rollout has done well, according to a survey of 1,642 dentists in England. 78% of dentists had two doses and their booster, while 10% had got as far as becoming double vaxxed. However, there is a considerable 2% that refused to inform the survey of their vaccination status.
How are the patients affected?
The consequences of putting pressure on English dentists has worried staff not only due to the state of their businesses, but for the patients that will be affect. Patients have been informed they might have to wait for a matter of years before they can get an appointment, which has led to some drastic measures, like patients who were reported pulling out their own teeth and using  DIY filling kits .
Chair of the BDA, Eddie Crouch, released a statement that expressed dentists ongoing support of the vaccine rollout, and the services’ stellar appreciation and “gold standard” for safety, but that the vaccine mandate is “a blunt instrument”, and will have “devastating consequences” to patients across the country.",Health
Living With Covid? How About Fucking Dying With Covid Instead,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/45487-living-with-covid-how-about-fucking-dying-of-covid-instead.html,2022,"We’re supposed to be living with Covid these days. Yeah, it’s mainly because the government practically bankrupted itself during the fucking lockdowns, either that or some very poor choices were made by our greasy haired Chancellor of the Exchequer and we are all suffering the consequences now.
The thing is, the pandemic never stopped. In fact, it’s getting worse because no one wears masks anymore apart from the diligent ones. Boris got bogged down in Partygate so he said fuck it let them all get infected. He lifted all restrictions to detract from the Partygate nonsense that nearly brought down the government. With no more restrictions, infections are soaring and due to the high cost of free lateral flow tests, the bankrupt treasury halted those, meaning no one knows what the hell is going on. It’s like a double fuckin’ whammy.
The worst part of this dereliction of care is that unless someone somewhere in government does something, the shit is going to escalate beyond any point of return. We have all these multiple variants banding around mixing with each other, Covid xyz, Covid abc, Covid this and Covid that. The real chart of infected is probably a 90° line up exponentially increasing at an r rate of 10.
Sure, it’s only mild, no one is getting sick you say. Yes, but what happens if one of these dastardly microbes decides to mutate into something really deadly and potent? Are you going to wear a mask then or just take it all into your lung tissue so it can shred your lungs from the inside out? What about people with underlying medical conditions?
What about the longterm effects of being infected with Covid? Some scientists say it shrinks the brain, causes longterm fatigue and can linger in the body for months. Who fucking knows anymore? One scientist says one thing and another says something else. Living with a shrinking brain? We’ll soon have a population of dumbed down idiots stuck in front of their TVs watching  Strictly Come Dancing  and antique show reruns for eternity (oh, shit).
We are not living with Covid, we are fucking dying of Covid and all the government is doing is watching from afar. Let them die of Covid. Let them get infected. They don’t like Covid rules. It’s all about the money. Making money to pay more tax is hugely important to the programmed masses therefore they have been given the freedom to continue their tax-slavery and die from Covid as well. How worthless is your pitiful life that you value money over it? Essentially, we are not defeating this virus but allowing it to mutate ad infinitum.

5 A Day: EU Vegetables and Fruit Full of Cancer Causing Chemicals,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/46009-5-a-day-eu-vegetables-and-fruit-full-of-cancer-causing-chemicals.html,2022,"Have you had your 5 A Day portions of dangerous cancer causing EU vegetables and fruit?
The Pesticide Action Network ( PAN-Europe ) has revealed most of the fruit and vegetables from the EU analysed had traces of chemicals used in the most toxic types of pesticides, linked to cancers, cardiovascular problems and diabetes. They can also be highly toxic to the environment, poisoning rivers and other precious ecosystems.
The analysis, based on almost 100,000 samples, highlights a 53 percent increase in contamination by the most hazardous pesticides found in fruit over the period 2011-2019. PAN Europe’s report shows an 8% increase in the proportion of contaminated fruits and vegetables, compared to 2015-2017.
It seems the European Union’s stringent rules and  diktats  on other countries’ exports do not extend to the EU’s exports of fruits and vegetables, and for the sake of massive profits they are exporting deadly chemically cancer causing produce to Britain and other parts of the world.
So much for the supposed EU standards in food production, as the evidence plainly shows that there is complicity in the production of such deadly, toxic fruit and vegetables.

To live in any society is in itself an act of pain, the act of survival and existence has its cyclical ups and downs, these are normal human emotions reacting to events in our lives and environment.
“You can’t take a pill to cure your shit life. These  pharmaceutical companies  have been making trillions on peddling these so-called happy pills that solve nothing apart from the bulging bank accounts and salaries of the big pharma companies,” a man with reasonable levels of logic revealed.
The only way to cure a shit life is to actually work and excel in something to increase your standing plus your mental wellbeing.

2 Tips for Those Who Struggle in the Kitchen,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/47680-2-tips-for-those-who-struggle-in-the-kitchen.html,2022,"ADHD  (and other types of executive dysfunction) can be difficult to manage, especially when it comes to eating, preparing food, and washing up. Just the thought of having to deal with this task can feel overwhelming – even before you have opened the fridge to take your eighth look inside, hoping different options will appear out of the blue.
If this sounds familiar to you, this piece is here to help. It is going to discuss some top kitchen tips for those with executive dysfunction issues to help make mealtimes that much more manageable.
Get With the Gadgets
Certain kitchen gadgets can make life easier, especially when they can take away the majority of the  burden when preparing food . For example, choppers are an excellent tool to use to help cut up vegetables and fruits, which otherwise could take up a lot of time and energy. Many choppers now have been devised to cut up all kinds of different foods with just one chop – leaving them ready for you to eat or do whatever you need to do with them.
Other gadgets that might be useful to include, an air fryer, a slow cooker, and of course, a dishwasher. Air fryers not only use a lot less electricity than conventional electric ovens, but they also have even easier operational instructions. You can simply put many different foods in without needing to preheat, and they are cooked sometimes within half the time that a conventional oven would do. This is great for those who are short on time, or find themselves not hungry after preparing a meal for a long time.
Also, you can get a dishwasher, as this can make the world of different to dishes piling up in the sink, which can often  become a problem for those with executive dysfunction .
Go One-Use (Yes, Really)
In a world where one-use plastic is frowned upon, it can be difficult to talk yourself into using this as a technique. However, if this is the difference between you eating and you not eating, then always choose the former. It is easy to get hold of paper plates and bowls that you can throw away afterwards if washing up is too much – but did you know, you can also bulk buy items that are eco-friendly and biodegradable, such as  pizza boxes , hot and cold food containers, coffee cups, and more? This can make the opportunities endless for meal prep, eating when you have low energy, or are unable to do the dishes – and can make life just that little bit easier.
Executive dysfunction is extremely common. Up to  80% of women with autism  alone are said to experience it. There is nothing to be embarrassed about and there are  ways to make life more manageable , so you can enjoy a better quality of life. It is important to remember you are not alone, and to do whatever helps.",Health
"Bye, Bye NHS !",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/47523-bye-bye-nhs.html,2022,"In years to come, you will sigh as you say ‘remember the NHS‽’ it will be a distant memory, something cast to the farther reaches of the mind. Some will have fond memories of ye olde National Health Service, others will not.
In true human tradition, anything that is inherently good and supposedly free in this world is eventually abused, corrupted, violated, and plundered.
The NHS was a socialist utopian dream that was not free, though. The money to pay for it had to come from somewhere. Socialists firmly believe that there is a magical  socialist money tree  somewhere that bears 100 pound notes as fruit for eternity. Yes, it is a lovely thought, but reality is not something socialism as a political ideology close to communism is aware of.
The Labour government of Attlee, who created the NHS, did not factor in an NHS used by half the earth’s population.  Beveridge , who designed the NHS and Benefits system, actually was a eugenicist who stipulated that anyone who received benefits from the state should be sterilised. His lofty thoughts on that matter were unfortunately never adopted.
You see, the NHS as a system can function beautifully within a parameter where the nation’s population is relatively low, but it cannot function where the population is massively enlarged, and mainly consisting of non tax paying perpetually unemployed people.
There is no solution to a hugely oversubscribed entity bleeding money through terminal mismanagement and needless waste apart from complete collapse.
You may think things are all right when you eventually get a phone consultation with a GP in three weeks time, but your three-week wait and two minute rushed phone consultation is a very pertinent sign that all is not well in the NHS. In the 1950s, if you revealed that things would be like that in 2022, they would laugh at you.
Decades of unfettered mass migration into the UK from the world’s poorest countries encouraged by socialists effectively killed off their own socialist NHS dream. Prime Ministers like Tony Blair opened the floodgates into Britain, and the country is paying for this now as the people who came over were not rocket scientists, IT professionals or doctors, they were predominantly uneducated useless economic migrants from the poorest EU countries looking for British benefits…i.e the same sort of people coming over in dinghies from France every day by the thousand.
Okay, in defence of the likes of Blair and the socialists, their overall plan was to gain votes for elections by simply importing them into the country by the million, however with this strategy they did not realise they would not only overload the benefits system, but they would kill off their sacrosanct socialist project — the NHS.

Five Tips to Relieve Stress,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/47620-five-tips-to-relieve-stress.html,2022,"S tress is something that many individuals experience. Several aspects of daily life can increase stress levels, including work, family problems, health issues, and financial responsibilities. Chronic stress raises your chance for illnesses like cardiovascular disease, anxiety, and depression. Thus, it is essential to understand how to manage stress to improve one’s quality of life. Below are some tips to relieve stress.
Moving your body may benefit you if you’re feeling stressed. Regular exercise has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and depression. Start with easy activities like walking or biking if you are currently inactive. You may improve the likelihood of continuing exercising over time by picking one you enjoy.
Vitamins and minerals are vital for the body’s ability to respond to stress and control mood. Having insufficient amounts of both may damage one’s mental health and capacity to handle stress, so it’s essential to make sure that you get enough each day. 
Aside from supplements,  CBD flower  can potentially help you feel less restless and reduce anxiety. Some hemp varieties may make you feel euphoric and relax your nerves, which may – should this happen – boost your daily life.
Every area of overall health, including mental health, is hugely influenced by food. Chronic stress may cause  overeating  and leaning toward extremely appetising foods, both of which can be detrimental to general well-being and disposition.
The lack of nutrients like B vitamins and magnesium, that are essential in the control of stress and mood, may increase your risk of nutritional deficiencies. To ensure that your body receives the proper nutrition, you should limit the amount of highly processed beverages and meals and increase your consumption of whole foods like vegetables, fruits, and fish.
Making time for yourself each day could help you feel less stressed. Walking outside, reading a great book, getting a massage, and doing yoga are some examples of self-care activities. Self-care has been linked to reduced stress levels and better quality of life, whereas neglecting your needs increases the likelihood of stress and burnout. Self-care doesn’t have to be complicated. It simply means taking care of your happiness and well-being.
When you are under mental stress, your sympathetic nervous system is activated, putting your body into a fight-or-flight response.  Stress hormones  cause the body to respond by speeding up respiration, the heartbeat, and blood vessel constriction. The parasympathetic nervous system, which governs the relaxation response, may be activated with deep breathing techniques.
Exercises for deep breathing include breathing through the diaphragm, the abdomen, the belly, and at a set rate. Deep breathing aims to slow down and deepen your breathing by bringing your consciousness to it. Deep inhalations through the nose cause your abdomen to rise and your lungs to expand fully. Your heart rate will slow down, as a result, making you feel calm.
Stress is an inevitable part of life, and it has a negative impact on your physical and mental health if it persists. The good thing is that these techniques can assist you in reducing stress and enhancing your overall health.",Health
BBC Mourns Loss of EU Directive Forcing Us to Eat Insects,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/46974-bbc-mourns-loss-of-eu-directive-forcing-us-to-eat-insects.html,2022,"Damn it, how are we going to live with ourselves now, apparently Brexit has ruined our chances of eating insects for the rest of our sorry lives. According to the  BBC , the menu item of bugs is a huge loss for the planet.

Six Work Environments That May Lead to Cancer Over Time,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/60412-six-work-environments-that-may-lead-to-cancer-over-time.html,2025,"C ertain workplaces expose employees to hazardous substances that may increase their cancer risk over time. From industrial sites to office buildings, prolonged exposure to chemicals, radiation, or pollutants can have serious health consequences. Understanding these high-risk environments is crucial for prevention and early detection.
In this article, we will explore six work settings linked to long-term cancer risks, helping workers stay informed and take proactive steps for protection.
Prolonged exposure to hazardous substances such as asbestos, benzene, formaldehyde, and heavy metals in industrial and manufacturing settings poses significant cancer risks. Workers in these environments often inhale toxic fumes, handle carcinogenic chemicals, or come into contact with radioactive materials. This increases their likelihood of developing lung, bladder, or blood cancers.
As per the  CDC , numerous exposures may lead to increased cancer risk, including industrial exposures. Approximately 2-8% of all cancers globally are caused due to long-term exposures to carcinogens in the workplace. Lung cancer was the most prevalent cancer worldwide in 2022. Specific industrial settings and tasks that increase the chances of lung cancer are rubber manufacturing, roofing, paving, painting, and chimney sweeping.
Poor ventilation, inadequate protective gear, and long work hours further heighten exposure risks. Without strict safety protocols, employees may unknowingly inhale or absorb these dangerous substances, leading to severe health complications that manifest years after initial exposure.
How can factory workers ensure they are not unknowingly exposed to hazardous substances?
Factory workers can protect themselves by wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and following safety protocols. They must ensure adequate ventilation in their work environment. Regular training on hazardous materials, routine health checkups, and staying informed about workplace risks can also help minimize exposure. Advocating for stricter safety regulations and proper handling of toxic substances can further reduce health risks.
These sites expose workers to hazardous materials like asbestos, silica dust, and lead. Constant exposure to these materials increases the risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, leukemia, and other serious illnesses. Asbestos is the major cause of mesothelioma.
A study by BMC Public Health found that the total number of fatalities due to occupational exposure to asbestos increased by 20.2% from 1999 to 2019. Approximately 80% of Mesothelioma cases are due to asbestos exposure.
Asbestos has a long incubation period, which is why it takes several years for the disease to emerge even after the exposure stops.
Inhalation of other airborne toxins from cutting, drilling, and demolishing structures makes proper protective measures essential. These sites generate massive amounts of waste, including concrete, wood, and metal debris, which can release harmful pollutants. Without proper disposal and safety protocols, both workers and nearby communities face long-term health risks from exposure to toxic dust and environmental contamination.
Firefighting and emergency response roles expose workers to extreme heat, smoke, and hazardous chemicals, increasing their risk of developing cancer over time. One major concern is aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), a chemical-based suppressant widely used since the 1960s to combat fuel fires.
AFFF was highly effective in smothering flames by creating a barrier, making it a standard in the military, aviation, and industrial firefighting. However, it contained per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.” According to TorHoerman Law, these chemicals are known as forever chemicals due to their persistence in the environment and the human body.
Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, leading to legal action against manufacturers. Many affected firefighters have filed a  firefighter foam lawsuit  to seek compensation for health damages caused by PFAS exposure. The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers knew about the health hazards but failed to warn the firefighters and the public.
Are there specific decontamination protocols to reduce chemical exposure after a fire?
Yes, firefighters follow specific decontamination protocols to reduce chemical exposure after a fire. These include removing contaminated gear, using wet wipes to clean exposed skin, and taking thorough showers as soon as possible. Proper laundering of protective equipment and ventilation of fire stations also help minimize long-term toxic exposure risks.
Hazardous chemicals, radiation, and infectious agents pose major health risks to healthcare and laboratory workers due to frequent exposure. Handling chemotherapy drugs, formaldehyde, and disinfectants can increase the likelihood of developing leukemia or other cancers. Many times, bacterial infections within healthcare settings can also lead to cancer.
Also, long-term exposure to X-rays and radioactive materials without proper shielding poses serious health risks. Laboratories also contain volatile organic compounds and biohazards that can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Without strict safety protocols, PPE, and proper ventilation, healthcare and lab professionals remain vulnerable to long-term occupational health hazards.
Agricultural workers and pesticide handlers face cancer risks due to prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals such as glyphosate, organophosphates, and carbamates. These substances, commonly found in herbicides and insecticides, can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested, increasing the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, etc.
Medical News Today  reported that glyphosate has been designated as a probable carcinogen by the IARC. It also led to legal settlements totaling $11 billion for plaintiffs challenging its safety. A more recent study determined that frequent glyphosate use is linked to an increased risk of all cancers, particularly colon and pancreatic cancer.
Frequent contact with contaminated soil, water, and crops further heightens exposure risks. Without proper protective gear, strict handling procedures, and regular health monitoring, farmworkers remain vulnerable to long-term health effects. Pesticide safety regulations are essential for reducing occupational cancer risks.
How long do pesticide chemicals stay in the body after exposure?
The duration pesticide chemicals stay in the body depends on the chemical type, exposure level, and individual metabolism. Some pesticides break down within days, while others, like organochlorines, can accumulate in fat tissues and remain for months or even years. Regular exposure increases the risk of long-term health effects.
Workers in mining and oil drilling face prolonged exposure to hazardous substances, increasing their cancer risk. According to Cancer.org, those in oil refineries and gasoline-related industries are routinely exposed to benzene, a carcinogen found in crude oil and gasoline. Studies link high benzene exposure to elevated rates of leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as lung cancer.
On the other hand, miners are exposed to hazardous substances like silica dust, coal dust, and other particulates. Exposure to radioactive materials and heavy metals, such as arsenic and mercury, further heightens cancer risks. Poor ventilation in underground mines and constant contact with drilling fluids amplify these dangers. Without strict protective measures, workers in these industries remain vulnerable to life-threatening occupational health risks.
Protecting Workers from Hidden Cancer Risks
Workplace exposure to hazardous substances remains a significant yet often overlooked risk factor for cancer. The above-mentioned workplaces expose workers to toxic chemicals, radiation, and airborne pollutants that can lead to severe health consequences over time.
Awareness, protective measures, and strict safety regulations are essential in reducing these risks. By staying informed, promoting safety, and getting regular health checks, workers can protect themselves from occupational cancer hazards.",Health
Is the NHS Completely Dead or the Walking Dead?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/49008-is-the-nhs-completely-dead-or-the-walking-dead.html,2023,"The NHS is not only dead now, but there is little any party, Labour or Conservative, can do for it. Unfettered mass immigration over the decades murdered the Beveridge creation, simply because the NHS was not designed for the millions, and millions, and multi-millions of extra patients inundating its limited capacity. It’s simple physics, nothing can survive a swarm, and the NHS is swamped, the locusts have swarmed and rendered the health service into a basic empty shell.
Throwing trillions of taxpayer pounds into a limitless black hole will not do anything either, the NHS is mired in useless bureaucracy, incompetence and now strikes. Spare a thought of course to the decent, hard-working NHS staff who have to deal with such a crumbling service every day of their lives.
Every year, billions of pounds are wasted through general intransigence to adopt change, and the same old tired outdated formula is thrown at the NHS as it bleeds from heavy wounds. Inundated by millions of people onto limited services, limited beds, limited doctors and nurses.
The NHS started on the 5th July 1948. The population of Britain at that time was 49.4 million. Today, the population of Britain has exploded to nearly 70 million. By 2060 the population of Britain is projected to be close to 90 million.
British taxpayers are not only paying for their own NHS treatment, but for others coming here solely to use its services, then go back home before paying a penny for the service, or just stay here anyway and continue to use the services for free. The NHS has essentially become a de facto free International Health Service.
Along with mass unfettered immigration, illegal or not, the huge influx into a tiny island with a limited capacity for services has signalled the death knell for the NHS, once a beloved, treasured institution to Britons, now a smouldering foggy swamp where patients are left on trolleys in corridors to die alone, and ambulances never turn up.
Waiting lists for operations means patients wait for two years or more, no GP appointments, bed blockers, no hospital beds, not enough nurses or doctors, ageing equipment etc. etc… The NHS is dead. R.I.P. But it’s NOT dead! No, this project, as swamped as it is, will continue toddling on like a walking dead zombie. Successive governments will continue to pour trillions into something that is not fixable.

Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV were suddenly back in vogue and began to rise again thanks to the dating apps capitalising on the ease of casual hook-ups and 2013 was a bumper year for a massive increase in STI spreading far and wide.
Today in 2022, syphilis is at the same level as it was in the 1950s thanks to the success of  casual dating apps .
With an added drop in condom use especially with promiscuous gay men, HIV and AIDS are also increasing at an exponential level, but modern drugs halt certain death amongst this group of society.
Syphilis if not treated can cause multiple health problems and can lead to death.
All of this data points towards a fundamentally sick, masochistic society that even creates apps to increase its own level of sickness. The only positive is that nature finds a way to reduce the population level in a natural controlled manner and utilises human stupidity and greed to its advantage.

Doh! Even Royalty Gets Cancer,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54766-doh-even-royalty-gets-cancer.html,2024,"Who would have thought it, even members of the royal family get cancer. From the multitude of surprised press reports about King Charles getting the Big C, you would think that the royal family are viewed as superhuman beings, or in David Icke’s case — reptilians from the Draco constellation.
There is a fundamental difference of course in the treatment a prominent member of the royal family receives to that of the general public. They recieve the highest level of medical care and the best doctors who are on hand at all times to serve the royal cancer patient. This is in stark contrast to someone who is probably on the NHS, where an appointment for treatment can be over 6 months ahead, and by that time the patient will have deteriorated drastically. Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in the world, but if you are a royal it’s okay, you are in good hands.
It has not been revealed what type of cancer the monarch has, but it is almost a certainty that he will be cured soon enough, and all this hoo-ha will be gone.
The release of the information about King Charles’ illness is somewhat suspect, however it could be a way of normalising cancer as it becomes way more prevalent in these times. Microplastics, chemicals, food wrapped in plastic, and high amounts of sugar and hormones pumped into everything all play a part in the modern lifestyle of millions of people. Normalising something like cancer, when it used to be quite a rare occurrence, is also a way of surreptitiously covering up the epidemic.
It is however with a sigh of relief to know that the members of the royal family are not reptilians, and are just normal human beings who are from a certain protected lineage.
David Icke claims in his books that the royal family are part of the blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian race from the  Alpha Draconis  star system, now hiding in underground bases, and are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity.

FAQ About Resveratrol Anti-Ageing Properties,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54992-faq-about-resveratrol-anti-ageing-properties.html,2024,"Resveratrol is a natural anti-ageing polyphenol compound found in various plant sources, including the skins and seeds of red and purple grapes, berries, peanuts, and pistachios. It has garnered significant attention for its potential health benefits and medicinal properties.
One of the key properties of resveratrol is its anti-ageing antioxidant activity, which helps neutralise harmful free radicals in the body. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to ageing and disease. By scavenging these free radicals, it may help protect cells from oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Resveratrol also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, which can help reduce inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is linked to various health problems, including cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes. By modulating inflammatory pathways, resveratrol may help alleviate inflammation and improve overall health.
Another notable anti-ageing properties of resveratrol is its ability to activate sirtuins, a group of proteins involved in regulating cellular processes such as metabolism, DNA repair, and longevity. Sirtuins are associated with longevity and healthy ageing, and it has been shown to mimic the effects of calorie restriction, a dietary intervention known to extend lifespan in various organisms. By activating sirtuins, resveratrol may promote cellular repair and resilience, potentially slowing down the ageing process.
Additionally, resveratrol has been studied for its potential cardiovascular benefits. It may help lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and protect against heart disease by enhancing blood vessel function and reducing inflammation in the cardiovascular system.
Furthermore, research suggests that the anti-ageing compound may have neuroprotective effects, making it a potential therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It can cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to exert its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions directly in the brain, where it may help protect neurons from damage and promote cognitive function.
What are the recommended daily dosages of resveratrol for achieving its various health benefits, and how do these dosages compare to the amounts naturally occurring in foods like red wine and grapes?
The recommended daily dosages for achieving its various health benefits can vary depending on factors such as individual health status, age, and specific health goals. While the dosages used in research studies are often higher than what one would typically consume through diet or moderate red wine consumption, they provide valuable insights into the potential effects of resveratrol. It’s essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage for individual needs and to ensure safety and effectiveness.
Are there any known contraindications or potential risks associated with long-term resveratrol supplementation, particularly when taken in higher doses?
While resveratrol is generally considered safe for most people when taken in recommended dosages, there are potential risks and contraindications to be aware of, especially with long-term supplementation or high doses. Some studies have suggested that resveratrol may interact with certain medications, particularly anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, potentially affecting blood clotting. Additionally, high doses of the supplements may cause gastrointestinal issues or interfere with specific enzymes in the body. It’s crucial to discuss any potential risks or concerns with a healthcare professional before starting resveratrol supplementation.
How can individuals ensure they are purchasing high-quality resveratrol supplements, and are there specific factors to consider, such as sourcing or manufacturing processes, to maximize effectiveness and safety?",Health
20 a day smoker worried 5G mast will give him cancer,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/24/20-a-day-smoker-worried-5g-mast-will-give-him-cancer/,2020,"A Bolton man says he fears that 5 aside football pitch flood light is actually a secret 5G mast that will cause him to develop cancer. 38 year old Bill Board told us that he fears the mast is a plan by the Government to kill him with cancer. Bill, who got a U grade in GCSE Science and spent the 2 year course telling teachers that he didn’t understand why he should study science as he was never going to need it when he was joining the Army explained that he likes to do his own research into these things.
Professor Frederick Seddon of Rochdale College told us, “It’s a load of rubbish obviously and all the studies demonstrate that. The problem we have at the moment is that at some point society decided it was cruel to tell the terminally thick that they’re terminally thick. Now equal weight is given to Bill’s opinions as say that of a research team of Physicists and medical doctors looking into the effects of 5G on people. Then, because Bill is terminally stupid he’s incapable of understanding the evidence but nobody can challenge him because he has a right to an opinion no matter how stupid, ignorant and uninformed.”
Professor Seddon went on, “To a large extent the media has a lot to answer for. Whether its newspapers badly reporting about the carcinogenic properties of various molecules to the harmfulness of GMO’s and nuclear power they’ve all had a part in encouraging total idiots into thinking they’re making informed choices.”
“The BBC are just as bad. They take a scientific subject and interview a scientist on it then, for “balance”, they interview somebody that was in Eldorado or Nigel Farage to explain why the scientist doesn’t know what they’re talking about and that in fact they are part of an establishment cover up. Now they’re wondering why people are burning down 5G masts. Perhaps they should add a bit of context by reporting other areas of the news in the same way? For instance, they could take the same approach with Match of the Day. Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer could spend 10 minutes discussing the highlights of Man City v Liverpool then Nigel Lawson could be invited to spend 10 minutes explaining that what they’ve just seen is evidence that football doesn’t exist and that Gary and Alan are in fact part of an elaborate establishment cover up.”
Bill’s friend, Stan Still told us, “Yeah Bill’s pretty stupid. He’ll say stuff like he only smokes when he goes out but since the lockdown he’s still been getting through 20 fags a day and I don’t think there’s been a night he hasn’t sunk 8 pints since it all started. If he gets cancer he’ll blame 5G. He’ll buy any white powder and stick it up his nose. He once spent a week in Ibiza snorting horse laxatives. We only found out because he attempted to sue this bar we always went to because he said they were giving him dodgy pints as he always had the squits the rest of the night after we’d left.”
It’s unclear when society will go back to telling the terminally stupid they’re terminally stupid and ignoring them but there are signs this may be close as Donal Trump has encouraged his supporters to inject bleach to fight Coronavirus.",Health
5G blamed for amnesia as thousands of twats forget to be Islamophobic,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/12/5g-blamed-for-amnesia-as-thousands-of-twats-forget-to-be-islamophobic/,2020,"Amidst growing concern from the internet’s top pseudo-scientists about the risks posed by mobile technology, yet another coal has been added to the fire.
According to the prominent YouTuber Hope L’Scase, long-term exposure to massive doses of gamma radiation from thousands of 5G masts over the past 15 years has had a profound effect on our short-term memory. “Anyone with half a brain can see what they are doing.” L’Scase explained to her eleven followers, “I can.” Her video then continued with 15 minutes of white noise crackle before ending, “It’s all part of the Government’s plan to make us forget what they promised us in the past.”
“The science behind this is dubious at best,” Professor Ray D. Yates of Rochdale Community College told The Herald, “but clearly we need to investigate further. Analysis of a sample of 120,000,000 Tweets, Facebook posts and Daily Mail stories has revealed a 92% drop in the number of Islamophobic comments. This is remarkable by all accounts.” Prof. Yates continued, “There is as yet absolutely no evidence to link 5G with mass amnesia, but we are unable to explain what would cause such a massive shift of focus in the online turdblossom community. As recently as February they were adamant that Muslims were the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it. Them and Jeremy Corbyn.”
“However, in recent weeks we have seen their attention drawn to a very different threat in the form of a deadly virus. Only extensive scientific research will tell us why they now perceive a very real threat to be more serious than a totally imaginary one. Furthermore, they still blame Corbyn.”
It isn’t just social media users who appear to have been affected. Sources have reported that some 300,000 NHS staff have completely forgotten the Hippocratic Oath and are now lining up to punch Matt Hancock in the throat.

A regular at Rochdale’s famous Rat and Pudding pub, Jim is known to locals as ‘That tosser’, which h thinks is an affectionate reference to his surname. “Any bugger can walk up and down the bloody garden.” said Jim.  “He made 20 million so I reckon doing 100 pints ought to get at least 25 million.”
“Obviously I’m not going to buy the ale myself so I’m expecting the local N.H.S trust to pony up for the beer.

It’s foreigners that have caused this and we’re here to guide you through which foreigners to blame. So buckle up leftard avocado knitters because today, we’re dropping some truth bombs and your feelings are going to be the collateral damage.
Meghan Markle
Meghan only married Prince Harry because she thought she would be the King if she did. Before marrying him she turned him into Princess Harry and then had a child with him to trap him into the relationship. Then, when she realised she wasn’t ever going to be King she took Prince Harry to Woke-ada so they could have sex with Woke-ada’s gay President. The thing is, Woke-ada is so boring it doesn’t even have a McDonald’s so they’ve had to move to Los Angeles but Harry will get really sun burnt there. So Meghan needs to come up with a way of becoming King of England and that way is Covid-19. It’s no coincidence that her and Harry were over here visiting just before it happened and she definitely owns a Microsoft laptop. I mean, join the dots people. Bill Gates invented this thing so Meghan could become King. In the meantime, Harry is talking about doing things like helping the disabled instead of leaving them in a forest to be  eaten by wolves like what would happen in Britain.
The EU
And by the EU we mean the French. The French have a history of inventing diseases. In the 15th Century they invaded Italy and invented Syphilis. Before Syphilis STD’s were just things that would make you itch for a couple of days but would go away. But the French invented one that would make you go mad. They did this because they’re rubbish at fighting wars. Instead of having to fight, French prostitutes would be told have sex with the enemy and all the enemies men would die from it allowing the French to invade. Michel Barnier is that prostitute and he’s now given Covid to Boris in order to invade Britain and popularise accordion music and mime artists. Not only that but, everyone knows that the French are sending infected refugees over here in speed boats to infect us.
And if you still don’t believe us. It was a French flight attendant that had sex with the monkey that invented AIDS in the 1970’s and gave it everyone else.
The Chinese
From the Black death to West Nile Virus and German Measles the Chinese have invented every disease ever (Except AIDS and Syphilis). Not only that but everyone knows they like weird food. Ming Garden’s down the road? My mate Gary once got a meal from there and they’d put an entire cat in it. Katsu Curry? There’s cat in that. So they definitely invented it, it even started there after Bill Gates had infected the US Army with it.
Muslim’s
Obviously, blaming the Jews would be a bit Black Death/Spanish Inquisition. Basically, Muslim’s are deliberately infecting themselves with Covid-19 so they can implement Sharia law. What they do is visit people’s grandma’s and get invited into the house. Whilst your Grandma is making them a cup of tea they’re licking her Werther’s Original’s knowing that when she eats them or offers them to your kids. Your kids will eat them, become infected and die. Avoid this by wrapping your gran’s Werther’s Original’s in bacon. This will render any plan to impose Shari Law void.

Spokesman Bill Board said, “We use the same system that was designed in the 17th century for coordinating these things. Up until now we’ve been in the “Ring a ring ‘o roses” phase. There are are 3 further phases. Atishoo 1 and Atishoo 2 then the phase about all falling down.”
The plans include journalists wearing plague doctor masks when interviewing. Politicians are also expected to increase the frequency they are seen in badly fitting lab coats attempting to look like they know how to use a pipette.
The Government spokesman said, “It’s improving that people don’t panic. Roads must be kept open to allow emergency vehicles through. This will also make it easier for the Government to evacuate the country.”
Elsewhere today various organisations have been setting out their plans for dealing with the virus. The Church of England has said it intends to increase the frequency of prayer sessions whilst the Catholic Church has promised to start burning homosexuals at the stake and ensuring women are kept indoors last their sexual urges cause them to start spreading the virus.
The British Association of Chavpreneurs has also announced it intends to maintain high prices for hand sanitizer and toilet rolls by its members going out and continuing to buy all the stock in Aldi and Lidl and selling it on Ebay.

Disaster as it’s revealed Government only has enough Care badges for 1 in 5 care workers,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/16/disaster-as-its-revealed-government-only-has-enough-care-badges-for-1-in-5-care-workers/,2020,"Undercover reporters for The Rochdale Herald have discovered that the Government only has enough “Care” badges for 1 in 5 care workers as part of its latest scheme to deflect attention away from its total failure to tackle Coronavirus with anything resembling a plan or strategy.
One care worker who wishes to remain anonymous told us, “For 3 weeks now we’ve been warning that we’re not equipped for this. Over Easter weekend 1/3 of the residents in the home I work at died. The Government announced they were doing something and revealed the badges. At first I thought it was great as, whilst I might be completely vulnerable to infection and infecting other residents through lack of PPE I’d always be able to look at my badge and realise I’m valued. Well, when I say valued, they might see more favourably my appeal against deportation after they refused me the right to settle here now they’ve left the EU and I don’t earn enough money to qualify.”
Another care worker told us, “The badges were delivered this morning but I didn’t get one. Looking at it would have made up for the parking ticket I’ve just got for parking in an NHS parking spot whilst I take a resident to hospital to have her broken arm fixed. Still, it’s good to see that the MP that voted against allowing us to park for free whilst dropping elderly relatives off at hospital has his badge on. That provides much succor to me.”
When asked a Government spokesman told us, “Stop being so critical of us. It’s not like we’ve had long enough to prepare. We’ve only been in power 10 years and scientists have only been warning of such a pandemic since 1997. Anyway, imagine if Jeremy Corbyn had won?”

To put that in context  that’s equal to the number of people found floating dead in Michael Barrymore’s swimming pool. It is also equal to the number of people that have been shot dead by Oscar Pistorius.”
There are fears that deaths from the virus could increase over the coming weeks. “We’re preparing for the worst. In the coming days we expect it to equal the mortality rate of Princess Diana’s car crash. By next week it could be as lethal as lorry drivers and next month you’re looking at something as lethal as Iain Duncan Smith, the Royal Family and Jim Jones.”

Britain shows appreciation for NHS by funding it properly,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/27/britain-shows-appreciation-for-nhs-by-funding-it-properly/,2020,"Britain has decided to show its appreciation for the NHS by funding it properly.
The nation has made the decision that it doesn’t matter what expensive treatment you and your insurers can personally afford if you catch a disease from someone who cannot afford the same.
As a result, the UK has reaffirmed its belief that free at source healthcare is a right for all.
Britain has also decided that a single health service has an incredible negotiating power, so can buy medicines at a better price for all.
The massive negotiating power it has with suppliers is similar to the power of that sovereign wealth fund the Norwegians set up.
You know, that one they funded with the money from the oil in the North Sea they didn’t piss up against the wall.
That one, worth over £750 billion, that one, that we could have had one like.
That one.
To restore this power, Britain has also decided to reverse the division of the NHS into separate trusts, realising this 1990 decision had its origins in political dogma rather than public health.
Savings are also expected to arise from a reduction in both layers of management and the money those managers spend on professional advisers in an effort to avoid being sued.
This will instead be spent on medical care.
With less professional advisers recommending decisions that involve spending money on professional advisers, it is thought that outsourcing will also stop.
Hospitals are likely to return to the model of having a maintenance staff rather than paying a company £40 to hang a picture in six weeks.
These staff will also receive fair pay and a NHS pension encouraging them to take pride in their work than being precariously “self-employed” gig economy gimps.
With Trusts removed and outsourcing ended, the decision to remove services like mental health provision from the NHS and parcel them up into community interest companies ready to be bought by Americans will also be reversed.
Finally, the nation has decided that it will start listening to experts again, particularly when they warn a plague is coming.",Health
“Could Coronavirus be as deadly as Harold Shipman?” Your Coronavirus questions answered,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/13/could-coronavirus-be-as-deadly-as-harold-shipman-your-coronavirus-questions-answered/,2020,"With Coronavirus fever hitting the nation Rochdale residents had many questions. Professor Frederick Seddon of Rochdale College answers some of them.
Will Coronavirus be as deadly as Harold Shipman?
Harold Shipman killed between 250 and 300 people. The latest Government predictions are that 5000 to 10000 people could get Coronavirus. Given a mortality rate of 3.6% this means that we can expect 180-360 deaths. To put that in context, Flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. 5-10 people would be expected to be dead given 5000 – 10000 people infected. So yes, Coronavirus will be deadlier than Harold Shipman.
If the shops run out of soap can I make my own?
Yes. There are methods available on the internet to do this. One thing to bear in mind is that you’ll need a ready supply of fat. The fat clumps together as it doesn’t like water so it helps pus the virus off your skin. The cheapest option will be to use fat from Coronavirus victims. Just make sure the corpses are quite fresh.
How should I deal with elderly relatives?
At Rochdale College we’ve found the best way of dealing with them is by using a pillow. It tends to muffle the screaming as well which is always useful.
I’m worried that football will be cancelled and I’ll finally have an excuse to stop going as I’ve hated it for years. How should I handle this?
Tell everyone you’ve got Coronavirus then fake your own death.

Trump gives a shot in the arm to 2020 Darwin Awards,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/25/trump-gives-a-shot-in-the-arm-to-2020-darwin-awards/,2020,"President Donald Trump has thrown an unexpected and much appreciated lifeline to the 2020 Darwin Awards.
The well-known website which describes itself as  a “salute the improvement of the human genome by honoring those who accidentally remove themselves from it in a spectacular manner” was started in 1993 and has featured many incredible example of human stupidity. Past winners have elected to exit the mortal coil by pissing on live rails, posing for selfies on precipices and playing chicken with 800 tonne freight trains.
However, with the worldwide lockdown imposed to combat coronavirus, hundreds of thousands of potential Darwin nominees have been confined to their homes, greatly reducing their creative scope for self-destruction. Had the Herald bothered to contact Wendy Northcutt, curator of the awards, she probably would have told us, “It’s looking pretty grim for this year to be honest. Sure, many thousands or unfortunate souls have died from this horrible virus, but these were normal, decent people. There just aren’t enough total fucking dickheads playing on busy roads, headbutting trains or bungee jumping with steel cables. Unless they get back out there and start feeding themselves balls-first into heavy machinery soon, we may have to cancel this years awards through lack of interest. Yes, I mean the honourable mentions too.”
We imagine Ms Northcut would have continued, “President Trump has always tried hard to keep us afloat. His support base amongst the trigger-happy members of the NRA has produced a steady trickle of gun cleaning incidents; we always consider those for a nomination. More recently he kindly urged thousands of morons to take to the streets and protest the lockdown, but although many have risen to the call, it will be hard from us to distinguish the fuckwits from the innocent victims they help kill.”
But at a press conference yesterday, President Tide Pod surprised the world with the brilliant suggestion of injecting industrial strength disinfectant directly into the bodies of infected patients, a strategy so brilliant in that it will neutralise the virus by depriving it of a living host. Total eradication could be further guaranteed by scorching the lungs with artificial sunlight.
“That man’s a genius!” Northcutt didn’t actually say because we never spoke to her. “We’ve been saying for years that the human gene pool needs a little chlorine. Trump has listened and, well, come up trumps. After only hours the Emergency Medical Hotline in Maryland has received over 100 calls from potential nominees. It looks like this year could actually produce a bumper crop. Thank you, Mr President!”
The Herald has contacted a number of leading medical experts, cleaning product manufacturers and other clever bods for comment, and the response has been unanimous.
“Under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone consider injecting or ingesting cleaning products. Don’t even do it sarcastically. Put the fucking stuff down and leave it to the medical professionals to do their job!”

Coronavirus causes charmer to consider condoms,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/03/23/coronavirus-causes-charmer-to-consider-condoms/,2020,"Since moving to London, St Cuthbert’s alumnus Ben Green has prided himself on, in his own words, “spreading his chutney round Putney”.
Claiming to have graduated one of Rochdale’s leading Catholic schools, he has for several years used this to justify what his nan calls “forgetting to wear his raincoat”.
Whilst Green was an early adopter for protective Tesco apparel, wearing overalls and a mask to pick up his resupplies of Strongbow Dark Fruits, he has until now persisted with his love for bareback riding at the rodeo.
However, all of that could be about to change.
“I have long been confident that when I shoot, I won’t score, whether on or off the pitch,” explained the Fez Club 5-aside captain, “but I realise now that confidence was based on a world before coronavirus.”
Green had initially enjoyed the increased opportunities from the virus, for example asking girls if they would like to be his “Quaran-queen” or indeed whether they would like a rim job if they were short on Andrex.
But increased media focus on the potential for disease transmission has caused Green to reconsider his approach to his occasional seconds of intimacy.
“Now, with working from home increasingly prevalent, the chances of a girl working out exactly where I live have increased, and with that, the potential for consequences.”
As such, Green has decided to learn how to put condoms on in case he accidentally sires and abandons a series of children with different women, and is consequently forced to assume the office of Prime Minister at this time of national crisis.  He remains untested for STDs.",Health

That all changed a couple of months ago, when a new profile filter “#Stay Home – It Could Save Lives” appeared, alongside a seemingly never ending set of rants about such topics as people going to the park at the same time as Di wanted to go there with her kids.
She was also vexed by the queues of people trying to get into Tesco when she was trying to get into Tesco, the people walking around the street when she was walking around her street, and the noise of her neighbours’ TV which forced her to turn Netflix up.
It seemed everyone was getting in the way of her normal routing, stopping her from just “Di-ing”.
However, as the end of the Easter Holiday this was replaced with tales of how Ms Couglan is “beyond appalled” at the “so called Teachers Unions telling the governments what teachers want to do”.
She was quite sure that many “wise teachers” would #resist the “politicisation of the opening of schools.”
Still sporting her “#Stay Home” filter, she informed several of her friends that she had categorically never caught so much as a cold from her kids, so they should go back to school.
Former friend Mehdi Al-Professional told the Herald “I just asked her whether she was sure that was true, and she banned and blocked me.
I mean Sebastian is a perpetually snot nosed feral creature and I’m sure I’ve had about five colds off him last year, so it seemed far fetched.”
However, having received a letter from Ms Coughlan’s lawyers, the Herald can inform you that the notion that her children are walking little petri dishes prone to licking doorknobs is false.
Just because every mewling ball of sick and pus you ever encountered in primary school is an incredibly obvious vector for symptomless transmission does not mean they should be drawing on Di’s walls in crayon for a second longer than is necessary.

Goveid-19 now ‘out of control’ in UK.,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/07/12/goveid-19-now-out-of-control-in-uk/,2020,"A new, highly infectious virus – Goveid-19 – has reached pandemic proportions throughout the UK, an investigation by The Rochdale Herald has revealed.
Goveid-19 was first detected during the Conservative Party leadership election campaign in 2016 but was not at the time thought to be anything other than a minor irritant. The first person infected was Michael Gove, after whom the virulent disease has been named. The first sign of infection was a loss of his charisma and he wound up having as much as a used condom floating in the piss-filled gutter of a public house car park in South London.
Gove transmogrified into a golem, seemingly fabricated entirely out of smegma and was cursed with viscid, glistening perspiration. He was demonically given the ability to perambulate and gifted with a semblance of speech while remaining unable to tell the truth in any way, shape or form.
Goveid-19 is now spreading rapidly throughout the population. Public Health England have asked the public to be alert for the following symptoms:

A noble cause, but one that immediately raises some hard-hitting investigative questions. First, how exactly will Barangay officials confirm a mosquito is a Dengue carrier? Will there be a rapid test kit for bloodsucking insects? A mosquito interrogation chamber? Second, what if the mosquito was smuggled in from another Barangay? Will we see an underground mosquito trafficking ring? Third, are all mosquitoes eligible—dead or alive?

In his latest televised address to the Filipinos, President Rodrigo Duterte said a vaccine for Covid-19 is just “around the corner.” But first, some history: In the spring of 2016, Dengvaxia had a high-profile launch in the Philippines, as the country  became the first in the world to access the live recombinant tetravalent vaccine. The Department of Health spent $67 Million on Dengvaxia and kicked off a mass immunization program with the aim of vaccinating a million students by the end of the year. The immunization program was launched even before completion of the required Phase 3 of the clinical trials. ( Almost all newly-approved drugs would also usually go through a Phase 4 after it is made available in the market to further study their safety and efficacy in the population at large.) It turns out the Philippines may have jumped the gun on the vaccine after numerous reports of children dying as a result of the immunization. Dengvaxia’s manufacturer, Sanofi, also issued a rejoinder later, saying that their vaccine poses some risk to those who have never had a history of Dengue. Fast forward to 2020. The availability of a vaccine has become the Duterte administration’s main mantra in its policies and strategies to curb the spread of the novel coronovirus among the Filipino population. So, one can understand why Duterte and his brilliant Secretary of Health Francisco Duque  are more than ready to jump the gun on the first available Covid-19 vaccine from candidate developers in China and elsewhere. So, is the Philippines poised to repeat history?  Maybe, with some difference. In 2016, the “guinea pigs” for Dengvaxia were school children.  In 2020, Duterte has prioritized the following for the government’s Covid-19 vaccine : (In no particular order) No mention if Duque will be getting the first dose of the new Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available.",Health

During an emergency meeting held today in Malacañang, the IATF approved a third option that will not cost a single penny to motorcycle owners. The alternative involves the motocycle rider facing away (opposite direction) from the driver to prevent exposure to possibly-infected respiratory moisture or droplets.

Throughout the ceremony, the bride and groom will stand, sit or kneel six feet apart. 5. The bride and groom must disinfect with alcohol or sanitize each time they hold hands during the ceremony. 6.

The newly-wedded couple must sign a promissory note to sleep in separate bedrooms for 14 days from the day of the wedding. 9.

Locsin is facing ridicule for his recent tweet that seemed to suggest that ingesting or injecting soap could protect Filipinos from COVID-19 since as toddlers they ate soap in the tub and their angry patents washed their mouths with soap. Trump was similarly criticized for suggesting in a White House press briefing that Americans could be protected from the coronavirus by ingesting or injecting disinfectants. The Adobo Chronicles obtained a transcript of the two-minute conversation which we are now sharing with our readers and followers: TRUMP : Hello Teddy Boy, how are you my friend?

Effective Ways to Do Your Homework While Depressed,https://adobochronicles.com/2020/02/17/effective-ways-to-do-your-homework-while-depressed/,2020-02-17T10:25:19-08:00,"(Editor’s note: Occasionally, The Adobo Chronicles publishes guest articles on serious and important topics that we feel will benefit our readers.) First of all, and it is essential for us to start with this information, if you are clinically depressed , you have to be supervised by your doctor. It doesn’t mean that you mandatory should take medication, but it certainly implies the Internet should not be the only source of information for you now. However, if you are already dealing with this state and need some more tips on how to operate your life right now, or you are just feeling down, without any specific diagnosis, this article can be useful. Imagine that you are driving a stick in cold weather, and you need to get to the hill. You cannot go too fast — as there is a hill, and you cannot stop the engine completely, because it will be extremely hard to make it work again. So, you need to move slow and steady and maintain the pressure. You cannot expect your brain to be very productive by itself while you are depressed; it needs manual actuation. What is even more important, you have to do at least something productive daily. Otherwise, you will feel into a guilt-trap, which provoked more procrastination, which provokes more guilt, and it provokes not doing anything at all. So, don’t make huge plans, but follow the small ones you make. Let’s say so if you are truly depressed, you cannot prioritize homework. You can prioritize other things, which will help you to have enough energy for homework or at least its part. Some of those things are healthy eating, fresh air, and exercises. Healthy eating is not for your shape, it is for your blood sugar level, which should not jump there and back, as it can only make the situation worse. Less processed food, fewer sweeteners, no energetic drinks, dark chocolate instead of bars, more vegetables, and protein — this should be your nutrition plan. It may sound rather boring, but we are not magicians here, you have to work to get results. Exercises have multiple effects. First, they maintain the level of cortisol — the neuromodulator responsible for stress. Second, they help you to live the cycle of stress to the end. In our society, showing emotions is not the most common practice, and often we collect small unresolved stresses in our head. It is bad because we don’t have closure with negative situations. Sports, especially running and other active types, gives us that closure, and it helps to clear your mind very well. Online and offline, there are lots of support groups full of people who temporarily experience the same difficulties as you. You can communicate with them, share your anxiety, offer help to others, and receive some assistance yourself. It is always very good to talk to people who understand what you are going through. If at some point you realize that you cannot deal with all the assignments on your own, don’t hesitate and ask for help. A simple “ write my homework ” request sent to a reliable writing service can solve many problems. You can find recommendations and feedback about such companies in support groups and just online. Of course, it should not become a common practice, but you can use this option from time to time to improve your situation with homework. Yes, it is not the most inspiring thing to read, but positive psychology doesn’t work in every situation. You should realize that if you are in a bad mental, psychological state right now, your goal cannot sound like “stellar educational results and perfect marks.” It is unrealistic and will only make you more sad and discouraged. Your goal right now should be “to cope with the situation and my education process at a sufficient level. Sufficient level doesn’t sound like something bad or intimidating. When you lower the bar, you can clearly see it and plan your activities more adequately. Of course, it doesn’t mean you should allow yourself just to be lazy, or not to be attentive in class. In the case of depression or any other bad psychological state, you should not neglect to address professionals for help.",Health

The quarantine order stems from the network’s airing of the movie, “Contagion,” as well as its locally-produced telserye on 24/7 — both dealing with the subject of a virus spread. The airing comes at a time when Filipinos are panicking over the continued spread of the coronavirus in China and other countries. The PCOO order would mean the temporary shutdown of ABS-CBN so that it would not be able to continue airing the films which could only exacerbate the fear already being felt by the Filipino people. It wasn’t clear how long the quarantine period will be, but the worst case scenario is that the order will last until March 20 when ABS-CBN’s media franchise expires. In that case, the quarantine will be forever. Who says “walang forever?” (There is no forever).",Health

"Health Tip: To Beat Those Spring Allergies, Try Diving Headfirst Into A Volcano",,,"Allergies getting you down? Medical professionals agree that the best way to take care of those pesky allergies is to dive headfirst into a volcano and die. Instantly, your allergies will be gone! Just follow this three step plan: Travel to one of five currently active volcanoes —If you live in the United States you may want to consider Kīlauea in Hawaii. However, unlike volcanoes in Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nicaragua, and Vanuatu the lava is not always present.Lava is a key to the treatment. Assume a diving position —Bend the knees, extend arms forward with hands together or slightly apart. Prepare to dive. Spring! —For head-first dives, extend your arms overhead with hands clasped or stacked to break the lava's surface. This minimizes pain upon entry.The medical community strongly discourages jumping in feet first. Disclosure: Your allergies may act up prior to the dive because of the volcano's smoke and strong smell of sulphur. This is a temporary side effect of the treatment. This highly scientific treatment was designed as a response to hay fever, but can also be used as treatment for allergic reactions in response to dust mites, shell fish, and bee stings. So remember, as we approach summer and you begin to feel the burden of hay fever rest assured that the peace of a clear nasal cavity is just three short steps away. ",Health

Carson figures he ate a cumulative 500,000 calories in the space of about five hours, accounting for continued munching on leftovers throughout the afternoon. After doing a bit of addition while lying on the floor moaning, Carson believes he did indeed erase all of the calories he burned exercising over the past 365 days. ""I was impressed,"" Rebecca Carson, Matt's wife, said. ""He just kept going and going. I made a lot of food this year and I thought maybe he'd pace himself. But after he went back to the table for his 65th helping of turkey and stuffing, I knew we might have a problem."" Following last year's Thanksgiving meal, Carson had vowed to turn over a new leaf in the health department. He went to the gym twice per week, occasionally joined his wife for yoga, and even took the stairs instead of the elevator when he could. Sadly, his entire year's worth of hard work was canceled out once again in one single afternoon. ""I tried, you gotta believe me, I tried,"" Matt said. ""But the rolls got me. Well, the rolls, and the mashed potatoes, and the gravy, and the turkey, and the jello salad, and the sweet potato casserole, and the green bean casserole with the bacon, and the stuffing, and the pumpkin pie, and the apple pie, and the razzleberry pie, and -- hey, is that pecan pie over there?""

CDC Fights Waning Vaccine Interest By Sweetening Pot To 2 Donuts Per Jab,,,"ATLANTA, GA — As public interest in getting the COVID-19 vaccine fell to a new low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it will now be upping its incentive to giving 2 free donuts to anyone who takes the shot. ""One donut is not enough to take the jab, we get it. But what aboutTWOdonuts? Eh? Eh?"" said CDC spokesman Stan Lane. ""It's been a few years since the heyday of COVID-19, people have been settling back into their normal lives, and we know we need to liven things up a bit. Nobody can say no to TWO, count 'em, TWO, delicious donuts!""

Researchers Discover Miracle Cure For Gender Dysphoria Called 'Deleting TikTok',,,"LOS ANGELES, CA — Researchers have made a groundbreaking medical discovery this week, discovering a miracle cure for gender dysphoria called ""Deleting TikTok"". ""The results are truly stunning,"" Dr. Erik Mendez told reporters. ""By simply deleting this one app, patients are being cured of their symptoms in a matter of days. After billions of dollars spent and countless lives destroyed, the simplicity of the cure is simply astounding."" By cutting off access to videos of pink-haired men yelling online about being born in the wrong body, the study led by Dr. Mendez found a one-hundred percent drop in cases of teens who visited his office identifying as trans. Despite the overwhelming success, the results have led to pushback in the trans community. ""Curing a mental condition with a fifty percent suicide rate is extremely transphobic,"" said Cynthia Rounds, head of the non-profit organization Trans The Kids. ""Instead of cutting an app off kids' phones, we need to be cutting genitals off of kids' bodies. That is how we truly show kids that we care. We strongly condemn Dr. Mendez and his entire team."" In spite of the pushback, Dr. Mendez says he's hopeful his research can help hundreds of thousands of teens who identify as trans. ""I do see parents confused how letting their children watch popular trans icons get epic amounts of attention for being a misunderstood victim would in any way make teens want to do the same thing,"" said Dr. Mendez. ""But I'm working on creating a detox program to introduce the parents to normal people in their area who don't advocate forcing children to take cross-sex hormones to gain followers online.

Fauci Jealous As China Getting All The Credit For Creating COVID,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — According to several unnamed sources, Dr. Anthony Fauci has grown increasingly irritated as China appears to be getting blamed for creating COVID-19 — an accomplishment for which Fauci believes he deserves at least partial credit. ""The Wuhan Virology Lab would be nothing without me! NOTHING, I say!"" said an irate Fauci to several nearby witnesses. ""I made them who they are. I made sure they received funding to weaponize coronaviruses. It was ME! Me alone! Not them! I killed MILLIONS! I brought regimes to their knees! Mountains crumbled before my terrible wrath! And then I saved the world from my own wrath! I am GOD! MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!"" Sources say the Wendy's drive-thru worker he was yelling at then asked him to leave at once. Experts in virology and international espionage concur with Fauci's assessment, saying that COVID gain-of-function research was Fauci's project, funded at his direction in Wuhan after domestic labs said the work was too dangerous. Many are insisting Fauci be given some of the credit, or at least a marble statue of his likeness in front of the New York City morgue.

Critics have contended that the new approach preys on disabled and impoverished Canadians who may see assisted suicide as their only option, but the criticism has already been quieted since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze the bank accounts of anyone who spoke out against his regime's policies in the comments section of the healthcare website's blog, or on Twitter, or elsewhere.

The move came after Hunter had excitedly run to purchase his first ""Adult Happy Meal"", only to walk away deeply disappointed with the contents. ""This...was not what I was hoping for here,"" said Hunter, glumly eating his cheeseburger. ""I had my GoPro camera all set up to film and everything.""

McDonald's had initially conceived of the ""Adult Happy Meal"" as a joke, severely underestimating the number of grown men and women who are total masochists. ""We have really been blown away by the response,"" said D.C. franchise manager Lori Marsh.

Man On Diet Enjoys 23rd Consecutive Cheat Day,,,"COEUR D'ALENE, ID — Local dieter Christopher Woodleburk congratulated himself on sticking to his diet routine by enjoying his 23rd consecutive cheat day. After nearly 27 days on the popular, new Neolithic Beach Watcher Diet, Woodleburk says the only way to stick to an intensive diet regimen for the long haul is by allowing one or two cheat days per day. ""I'd go crazy if I didn't reward myself with an occasional cheat day,"" said the man while inhaling a pepperoni pizza for the fourth day in a row. ""How can anyone handle eating salads all seven days of the week, you know?"" While Woodleburk has not eaten a salad in months, he is correct that cheat days — days in which a dieter allows himself to ""cheat"" and eat less-healthy foods — do help people stick to diets longer. Studies show cheat days to be 100% effective at helping dieters eat more cheeseburgers. Doctors warn, however, that addiction to fad diets may, in fact, lead to increased calorie intake due to an inevitable rise in cheat days. For example, Christopher Woodleburk has just died of a heart attack. ",Health

Update: Number Of Safe Abortions Performed In All Of Human History Still At Zero,,,"EARTH — After examining records from every abortion carried out since the dawn of humanity, scientists have confirmed that the number of safe abortions performed still inexplicably remains at zero.

Shocked by the results, progressives desperately tried to change the definition of abortion in order to find a case where an abortion was performed safely. ""Instead of the well-understood dichotomy of miscarriage and abortion, we are going to re-define abortion based on what it meant in 1900, which was any loss of pregnancy,"" said Secretary of HHS Xavier Becerra. ""That means we are now calling miscarriages and procedures associated with miscarriage 'abortion', so we can scare women into thinking abortion restrictions will kill them."" Mr. Becerra then went and told a woman who just suffered a miscarriage that she really had an abortion and would soon be in prison for the rest of her life. Unable to re-define abortion, pro-murder obstetricians vowed to move forward in hopes of one day performing the world's first safe abortion.

The House of Commons then moved to impeach Johnson due to his admission he drank coffee instead of tea. ""I believe we're close,"" said Dr. Stephen Pomegranate, a researcher working with McDonald's in Paris. ""If I can just secure permission to use CERN's Large Hadron Collider I think I can unlock the secrets of the coffee bladder."" Experts say that understanding how coffee fills a human bladder could help us understand how to drink more coffee without having to go to the bathroom as much. ",Health
Doctors Confirm Life After Age 35 Is Just Endless Cycle Of Dieting And Back Pain Until You Die,,,"U.S. - According to medical professionals, people turning 35 years of age enter a new phase of life characterized by an endless cycle of dieting and back pain until the merciful release of death. ""When we released our findings, everyone over 35 said 'duh, we knew that already,'"" said 35-year-old researcher Ryan Fowstein. ""So I guess science has confirmed what everyone already suspected."" Fowstein then shrugged his shoulders but did it in a weird way that caused his neck to instantly get stiff and his back to spasm. ""OW, MY BACK!"" According to the study, once the body has been alive for exactly 35 years, it also forgets how to metabolize and digest food, forcing the subject to begin trying all kinds of diets to lose 10 or 15 pounds. The subject will then rediscover bread and cheese and gain all the weight back, over and over again, forever and ever. Researchers hope the study will help individuals resolve to make better health decisions - which they will later break before finally resigning to their eternal fate. Fowstein and the other researchers celebrated the conclusion of their study with a pizza party, which unfortunately led to 3 more weeks of indigestion and heartburn as well as back pain for some reason.

Man Will Go On Morning Walk But Refuses To Be Happy About It,,,"ESCONDIDO, CA - Local man Jack Wylder was urged by his wife to go on a morning walk to get some exercise. He agreed to go on the walk but clarified from the outset that he refused to be happy about it. After taking just a few steps on the path that meandered through the city and up into some beautiful, hilly terrain, Wylder resisted the urge to take a deep breath of the fresh, morning air and comment on how nice it was to be outside. ""The sun's in my dang eyes,"" grumbled Wylder as the first rays of morning peeked over the hills and bathed the couple in a warm glow that perfectly complemented the cool breeze whispering through dew-kissed trees. True to his word, Wylder resisted smiling and waving to friendly walkers, opting instead for curt nods and brief eye contact. His resolve was put to the test when a hiker passed by with the cutest dog he'd ever seen. He decided that giddily stopping and petting the dog was acceptable because asking the dog if it was not just the most adorable dog ever while scratching behind its ears did not constitute a walk. As the morning walk ended, Wylder told his wife that he agreed to go on a walk tomorrow morning but would still refuse to enjoy it. ",Health

Second-Grade Class Held On Airplane So Kids Won't Have To Wear Masks,,,"LOS ANGELES, CA - There aren't a ton of great teachers left in California, but there are definitely a few. Mr. Hammond of Carter Rock Elementary School in the suburbs of Los Angeles hated seeing his kids masked up every day, so he came up with a genius plan: he rented out a decommissioned Boeing 737 and held class in there. Now, due to the inexplicable magical properties of SCIENCE, his students don't have to wear masks anymore. ""I'm no hero,"" the teacher told reporters. ""I'm just doing what I would want any good teacher to do for me."" According to analysts, it's a foolproof plan.

Some scientists theorize the virus causing the syndrome mutated from Trump Derangement Syndrome earlier this year, raising concerns that it could cause many of the same destructive symptoms, from nonsensical rambling and cognitive dissonance to choosing to bankrupt your company rather than sell it to Elon Musk and screaming at the sky. ""Fascinating,"" said one researcher as she observed the virus under a microscope.

It doesn't matter if they have never actually read up on who Musk is or what he's done. They just foam at the mouth and break small objects upon hearing his name."" According to the researcher, the hatred for Musk occurs regardless of whether the host approves of other billionaires owning large media outlets or trusts billionaire-owned newspapers likeThe Washington Post. Most concerning is the virus can cause outbursts of violence, though scientists say this shouldn't be cause for alarm as most people infected with the virus have ""like, no upper body strength.""

""We've seen it jump to apes and household pets but now that reptiles are affected we have to work quickly."" This is not the first time a politician has been infected with the Coronavirus, but Pelosi is in a unique position as a confirmed reptilian overlord. The secret race of humanoids that disguise themselves to live among us and control our lives was previously thought to be invulnerable, but conspiracy theorists speculate Pelosi's addiction to alcohol and ice cream contributed to the infection. ""Reptilian humanoids are ancient creatures from an unnamed space quadrant the government doesn't want you to know about,"" said George Noory, host of the radio program Coast to Coast AM.

The abrupt change in unchanging SCIENCE has occurred at a serendipitous time for democrat politicians heading into midterms, as recent polls have shown an overwhelming desire to no longer be ruled by strict, ever-changing SCIENCE-based policies. This new variant of unvarying SCIENCE may be seen as vindication for the thousands of medical experts who were summarily shamed, berated, mistreated, discredited, demoted, or even fired for ever doubting the indubitable SCIENCE or ever suggesting the SCIENCE may change, which it has done and continues to do. ""I suppose I feel vindicated. I hope our nation finally remembers that SCIENCE has always been an ever-changing, imperfect process of seeking answers about our physical world,"" said one former doctor from his cardboard home deep in a hobo camp.

CDC Director Now Says To Just Do Whatever Texas Did 12 Months Ago,,,"ATLANTA, GA - The CDC has released new guidance for how states should deal with the pandemic by telling everyone to just go ahead and do what Texas did 12 months ago. ""Yeah, we were pretty much wrong about literally everything. Sorry about that!"" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to the press. ""It would seem the official science has changed. We should now be doing whatever Texas has been doing for over a year. To be clear, this doesn't mean Texas is good. They're still bad and we hate them. We just want to make sure that's understood."" The gathered journalists then began to scream towards the sky and hyperventilate at the thought of returning to some degree of normalcy, as well as the thought of Texans actually being right about something. ""I recommend we just drop all this and pretend it never happened,"" said Walensky. ""I'm still gonna be paid my salary, right?"" ",Health
Stacey Abrams Says She Doesn’t Have To Wear A Mask Because She’s A Governor,,,"ATLANTA, GA - Beloved Georgia politician Stacey Abrams was viciously pounced upon by conservative critics after being photographed maskless while she was surrounded by dozens of masked schoolchildren. But the haters quickly walked back their criticisms of the political firebrand after Abrams informed them that she's the Governor and governors don't have to wear masks. ""After hearing that Abrams was following the science of being an important governor around those small, dangerous vectors of COVID-19, we immediately retracted our denunciation and published a formal apology,"" said conservative pundit, Balswell Crocwelder with a tone of remorse and guilt in his voice. ""Who knows what horrific disaster would have occurred had she not been an important state leader who is immune from all mask requirements."" When pressed on the issue, Mr. Crocwelder finally admitted he only attacked Ms. Abrams because he wanted to date her. Co-hosts of ABC's ""The View"" praised Abrams for her intelligent use of science by being around kids as a duly elected governor, reminding viewers the scientific practice has been used by literally every other politician in the Democrat party, resulting in millions of lives saved. Joy Behar, long-time host of ""The View"" and likely MENSA hall of famer, praised Abrams as a fellow genius, and proposed that the same rigorously-proven science be used to stop the spread of AIDS by being a Democrat governer during sex.

Fauci Reveals He Has Forged In Secret A Master Vaccine To Rule All The Others,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Addressing the nation from his dark tower, Dr. Fauci revealed today that he has been forging in secret a master vaccine to rule all the others and cover all the lands in darkness. The ""One Vaccine to Rule Them All"" apparently gives Fauci the power to control anyone who has ""so foolishly"" taken his free gift of vaccines throughout the pandemic. ""One vaccine to rule them all, one vaccine to mind-control them -- one vaccine to boost them all and in their lack of natural immunity bind them,"" he chanted, reciting the inscription on the label of the master vaccine. According to legend, three vaccines were given to the CDC, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven were given to the Democratic state governors, skilled at ruling through manipulation and fear. And nine were given to the nine Supreme Court justices, who above all else desire power.  But in secret, Fauci forged a master vaccine, and into this vaccine he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his bizarre hatred for puppies. Ron DeSantis is reportedly leading his personal state militia to fight for the freedom of the United States once and for all. He'll definitely throw away the master vaccine into the fires whence it came once he acquires it, according to sources. ",Health

""The PCR tests give us a lot of false positives and the rapid antigen tests most people now use are even less reliable. At this point, it is prudent to recommend a coin toss as a cost-saving measure."" Official CDC guidance states the test can be performed with any spare change, but that best results are achieved with the official government-issued coin toss quarter. Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson slammed the new coin test. ""Americans have been sliding down the slippery slope for two years now. First, we had to lockdown for two weeks to 'slow the spread,' then we were told we could stop wearing masks if we took an experimental vaccine. Now the health of Americans hinges on a coin toss!?"" Tucker then stared at the camera in a mix of confusion and anger, like he didn't know what to order from Burger King. On Tuesday morning, Sen. Rand Paul rudely asked Dr. Fauci if the coin test was an attempt to lengthen the pandemic by legitimizing random test results. ""Again with the theater,"" said a righteously angry Dr. Fauci who did not answer the question. ""You are wrong again, as usual! Mic drop!""

Governor Gavin Newsom has been working closely with school districts to ensure a safe environment for students. ""Since no one watches the news anymore, it has become necessary to use the school system to communicate potential pandemic concerns. Sneezing is just one possible alert notification. Parents will also be notified of coughing, sniffles, and any mask slips,"" he said at the grand opening of his new vineyard.

Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor dismissed the study, saying: ""With more than 32 trillion people and 12 billion malfunctioning toaster ovens dying of COVID every three seconds, I think we have more important things to worry about here."" Social media platforms have warned users against sharing any quotes from the oral arguments on Biden's vaccine mandate this week, warning that such posts will be deleted, and possibly cause for suspension.

"After Positive At-Home Test, Couple Plans Elaborate COVID Reveal Party",,,"SAN FRANCISCO - A young couple of free thinkers united in common law marriage have some incredible news to share! Their at-home COVID test revealed not one but two faint purple lines. They finally have a breakthrough case just like all their favorite celebrities! Now they need to announce it to all their friends in the coolest way possible: a COVID Reveal Party. Logan Platt and Tiffany Silver were beginning to feel left out of the pandemic when they both noticed they were a little more tired than normal. Now they're excited to throw a massive bender at the start of their mandatory week off work. The couple is pulling out all the stops. They've taken full advantage of the gig economy to order vegan catering and tons of booze. ""It is gonna' be lit,"" said Logan seriously. ""We would have put up more decorations, but I was kind of tired,"" said Tiffany. ""I think we pulled it off okay, though."" Rumors about the party are spreading through the neighborhood like a California wildfire, but the couple isn't yet sharing how they'll reveal the COVID diagnosis. Some speculate a giant disco ball decorated like the popular virus will be lowered from the sky by a drone and then crack open, revealing two massive purple pool noodles to indicate a positive test. ""When it comes to reveal parties,"" said Logan, ""the bigger the better. All I'll say is that we're going to provide everyone with their very own home test just in case."" At publishing time, the couple happily revealed their results. It's an Omicron!!!!! ",Health
Businesses Now Requiring Positive COVID Test As Proof Of Vaccination,,,"U.S. - American businesses are now requiring employees to test positive for COVID before beginning their workday, since catching COVID is now the best way to prove you've been vaccinated. The new self-imposed mandates come hot on the heels of President Biden threatening to maybe require it among federal employees at some arbitrary point in the future possibly. Dr. Anthony Fauci has applauded the businesses for the new approach. ""You know, since the vaccine has been so perfect, but ineffectual, this will enable people to take advantage of natural immunity as if it were a sort of booster shot. I think the sooner we all get sick the better because it'll really bump up that vaccine efficacy."" ""We do still recommend masks, though,"" he added. California governor Gavin Newsom has picked up on the new trend and doubled down with a new requirement that all Californians be forcibly infected by a legion of transients. The new program is expected to create millions of jobs. ",Health
Leftist Who Keeps Taking COVID Tests Says He Can Quit Anytime,,,"RICHMOND, VA - A local family held an impromptu intervention for their son, Richard Chag, 35, who has been taking up to 24 COVID tests a day.

The family first became concerned after Richard's nose fell off. ""He said it was just a drug problem,"" informed his mother, Olivia Chag. ""But then I started to notice Q-Tips piling up in the trash. [My husband] never cleans his ears so I was immediately suspicious."" ""I just don't understand it,"" admitted Richard's father, George Chag. ""I'm a proud Democrat. I sat him down to explain 'the Covid and the bees,' but I just wanted him to wear a mask when he drives - not go insane!"" Though the initial intervention proved unsuccessful, his loving family isn't giving up on him. ""We're trying to explain to him that this is an incredibly deadly virus and his life is never going to be the same again,"" said his mother, Olivia Chag. ""But then - I don't know where I was going with this. Mask up, I guess."" ""Right, mask up,"" agreed his father, George Chag. ""With at least three masks.""

CDC Director Dr. Rachel Walensky said, ""This dramatic easing of urinal-centric restrictions comes at the conclusion of an 18-month observational study in which I surreptitiously observed men using urinals in malls, gas stations, and rest stops across the country. The accumulated data indicates leaving an empty urinal in between two men is no longer required."" Dr. Walensky clarified that the CDC still recommends men using urinals right next to other guys should refrain from sighing loudly, clearing throats, spitting, or cracking anatomy-related jokes. Local urinal user Chad Baltzwick expressed doubt about this new post-pandemic easing of regulations, stating he will continue requiring an empty urinal on each side of him just to be safe. ",Health

In a sample of 50,000 respondents, 5% of Americans believe Fauci to be a hero of science, 3% see him as an essential voice for COVID preparedness, and 90% support loading him into a medieval-style catapult and tossing him into an active volcano. ""We are surprised by these results, as 'tossing Fauci in a volcano' wasn't even one of the options on the survey,"" said a spokesperson for Pew. ""Thousands of people just wrote that in."" Health experts say the trends in public opinion are ""very concerning"" and may point to decreased trust in lying political hacks who dress up in lab coats and claim to speak for science. ""It's alarming to see so many people losing their faith in SCIENCE, and falling into apostasy,"" said a spokesperson for Dr. Fauci to the press. ""We need to remember that in these difficult times, SCIENCE tests our faith, to see if our hearts are truly loyal.""

Genius Marketing: Common Cold Rebrands As 'Omicron' To Generate More Hype,,,"WORLD - In a genius marketing move, the common cold has rebranded itself as 'Omicron' to garner some of that sweet coronavirus attention. ""I'll be honest, I was getting kind of jealous,"" said the common cold. ""At first I thought - 'Hey, this covid thing will pass and I'll be back in the spotlight. I outlasted the Black Plague and I can survive this'…but now that coronavirus is endemic I had to go after its market share."" The shift into 'Omicron' branding hasn't changed the common cold, however. Experts agree the common cold still has the same classic symptoms. It just sounds scarier and can be used to push government totalitarianism in perpetuity without the need for expensive testing. ""It's saving us a lot of money,"" said the venerable Dr. Anthony Fauci. ""We may even retroactively impose mask mandates on society. It's just too soon to tell."" Attorneys representing COVID-19 have filed a suit alleging copyright infringement, but the common cold doesn't think that'll go anywhere in the courts. ""It's nothing personal, it's just business,"" said the cold. ""Covid's gotta' get over itself.""

Almost all of those people who die will have had COVID at some point in their lives. This is horrible news."" ""This is a terrifying statistic,"" said Don Lemon on his nightly CNN broadcast. ""The correlation between being infected and eventually dying is too high to dismiss. The important takeaway here is that we should all be terrified.""

Conservative critics have responded by saying that everyone who voted for Biden will also eventually die - except for the ones who are already dead. ",Health

""I know that fully vaccinated people are still catching and transmitting COVID, but that's only because those first few vaccines weren't TRUE vaccines. True COVID vaccines have never been tried,"" explained a dancing AOC in her latest TikTok video. ""The first 2 or 3 doses didn't really count. We need everyone to take more boosters for the vaccines to actually be effective. That's just science!"" In a statement from a local Coldstone Creamery, President Joe Biden agreed, saying: ""Look, here's the deal. I would never lie to you nor would I forsake you. These vaccines are gencruztrerotic. At least that's what they tell me. Come on, man, it's trelblishnocent!"" Beloved infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci also confirms that Democratic messaging is scientifically accurate. When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper if people should continue to take booster shots for a vaccine that isn't a vaccine, Dr. Fauci replied, ""You know that's a great question, but it's just too soon to tell if a vaccine is a vaccine until it doesn't work. So, I'm going to have to say that we need to keep jabbing and keep masking until something works. That's science.""

""I'm surprised you have any major symptoms at all,"" she later confessed. Rod's primary doctor, Dr. Olivia Soliq, was eager to give the good news. ""Since it's just Omicron, he'll be given natural immunity with zero health risk! It's a remarkable variant.""

Just In Time: Pfizer Introduces Miracle Treatment For Myocarditis,,,"NEW YORK, NY - Pfizer has once again come to the world's rescue by creating a new vaccine that prevents people from getting myocarditis. Experts are hopeful that this miracle vaccine can stop cases of the once extremely rare heart condition that has recently spiked tremendously for no reason whatsoever. ""What's most surprising here is we have no idea what could have caused this increase in cases,"" said Pfizer's top immunologist Klaus Vanders. ""Normally we'd assume that some kind of experimental treatment was forced on an entire population for cases to jump like this, but since nothing like that has happened we have no clue."" ""As for the Myocarditis vaccine itself -  it is 100% effective, has absolutely no side effects, and zero data to back either of those statements up,"" Vanders continued. ""Also, everyone must get it or it won't work at all, but then it will work super well, and may even need boosters."" In a recent statement, the CDC has stressed urgently that if you have been vaccinated for COVID then you'll definitely need to get vaccinated for Myocarditis, but not because the two are related in any way. At the time of publishing Pfizer has reportedly already started working on a new vaccine that will prevent all of your teeth from falling out suddenly. Pfizer assures that this is a completely unrelated vaccine and not a side effect of the Myocarditis vaccine. ",Health
California Institutes Mask Mandate To Flatten The Horizontal Line,,,"SACRAMENTO, CA - Amid surging cases of a mild cold called Omicron, California is acting decisively to reinstitute the popular mask mandate.

I say we make that line flatter! Who's with me?"" According to sources, the entire crowd groaned, except for 3 surgical mask sales reps in the back, who cheered wildly. The mandate will require everyone to wear masks indoors, except for the rich and the powerful, who are not in need of such protections. This is because they have plenty of antibody-infused blood which their house servants have gladly volunteered to donate. Newsom confirmed that masks will continue to be worn until the flat line becomes flatter, or until the human spirit of California citizens is completely crushed, whichever comes first. ",Health
More Doctors Being Replaced By Kiosks That Just Play Pfizer Commercials,,,"U.S. - With hospitals facing historic labor shortages, many are automating their workforce by replacing doctors with slick new television kiosks that just play Pfizer commercials to patients.

""Once we realized that's all they really do, we thought 'Hey! We can automate that!'"" ProHealthica will be rolling out 1,200 new kiosks to replace their dwindling pool of physicians. Patients will simply select their symptoms on the touchscreen, and then watch Pfizer commercials for the cocktail of drugs Pfizer recommends. They can then simply click ""order"" to have the meds shipped directly to them. According to sources, the kiosks have better bedside manner than most doctors and will save all the wasted time by simplifying healthcare down to what it's really all about: creating a steady stream of income for Pfizer and government agencies.

Study Finds Politicians Safe From Myocarditis As They Do Not Have Hearts,,,"U.S. - A new study found that politicians cannot be harmed from heart issues due to the COVID-19 vaccines, as they do not have hearts that can be affected by complications such as myocarditis. ""Politicians? Oh yeah, they're totally safe from getting any kind of heart inflammation,"" said the head of the study, Dr. Ree Boyd. ""You kinda gotta have a heart to inflame, ya know?"" Experts say the study illustrates why politicians have been so quick to get vaccinated, while ordinary humans, who have hearts, are more hesitant. ""It seems people who have a heart and non-lizard blood flowing through their veins are more likely to be worried about heart issues,"" said Boyd. ""Lizard people tend to worry more about things like how to keep harvesting humans for a food supply and the eventual total domination of our planet."" ""It's just a cultural and physiological difference it would seem."" At publishing time, another study had also found that politicians are entirely safe from ever getting brain damage. ",Health

One member of the group, CFO Ian Fanticide, spoke solemnly with reporters about what a potential overturning of Roe Vs. Wade could mean for the country. ""As you know, Planned Parenthood provides a number of women's health services to the community,"" Fanticide said. ""If abortion rights are overturned or severely restricted, we may not be able to stay in business."" A reporter pressed Fanticide on this remark, as Planned Parenthood has routinely said abortion is only a small percent of what the group does. ""It's true that abortion is only 3% of what we do,"" he noted. ""However, about 94% of our revenue comes from things like abortion counseling, abortion-related paperwork, and selling fetal parts to vaccine manufacturers.

Maybe it will have cool side effects.Like mutating your kid into a shark. Shark kid! That would be awesome.

Fauci Hopes His Experiments On Puppies Will Distract Everyone From Experiments He Performed On Humanity For Past 18 Months,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Dr. Anthony Fauci is embroiled in controversy over his organization reportedly funding an experiment in which dogs had their heads trapped in cages and were eaten by sandflies alive, which we are told is a perfectly normal procedure performed by scientists as well as psychopathic killers in horror movies. Fauci is hoping that the uproar over the dogs will distract everyone from something he did that was far worse: perform experiments on the populace of the United States for the past eighteen months. ""Now that everyone's upset about the puppies, maybe they'll forget about how I played god with their lives for the last year and a half,"" he confided to a friend, according to an anonymous source. ""Everyone loves puppies. Well, except me, because I'm an evil bad guy. But people get real mad when you kill dogs for some reason. They'll get upset about this and probably try to cancel me. You know, this whole 'cancel culture' thing is really getting out of hand. You torture and murder a few dozen puppies and suddenly everyone's out to get you."" But Fauci went on to say that he thinks it's a positive development in the end, as ""people have really short attention spans and they'll forget that I did something way worse than off a few dumb dogs - I experimented with the lives of 330 million people and got away with it scot-free."" Fauci then got in his evil Zeppelin and flew off to his Lair of Evilness to hatch his next villainous plot. ",Health
Fauci Says Attacking Puppy Torture Is An Attack On Science,,,"BETHESDA, MD - Concerned citizens are raising questions about some experiments conducted by Dr. Fauci's NIH, including one where puppies were tortured to death, their vocal cords severed to mute their screams. In an interview, Fauci said that anyone who attacks puppy torture is attacking science itself. ""Puppy torture is science,"" said Fauci angrily. ""So is grafting baby scalps onto lab mice and engineering viruses that kill millions! I AM SCIENCE! I AM GOD!!!"" Fauci then threw back his head and laughed maniacally at the sky. Fauci insisted that his experiments are ""super important"", and ""real science."" He also defended some of his other experiments, such as the ""Kitten Drowning Experiment"", the ""Orphan Punching Experiment"", and the ""Piranha Kiddie Pool Experiment."" According to several sources, millions of progressives have quietly thrown away their Fauci pillows, candles, and plush dolls. Authorities say Fauci is still at large, being pursued by James Bond.

"San Francisco Bans People From Eating At Unsanitary In-N-Out, Must Eat On Poop-Covered Sidewalk Instead",,,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - The City of San Francisco has closed its only In-N-Out's dining room, since the restaurant refused to discriminate against its customers. Instead of eating in the unsanitary dining room where they might get sick, people are forced to get to-go orders and eat on the poop-covered sidewalk outside the restaurant, sources confirmed Friday.

Newsom Claims Syringes Strewn About California Cities Are Due To High Vaccination Rate,,,"SACRAMENTO, CA - California has come under a lot of criticism for dirty needles and piles of poo lying all over its major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. But Governor Gavin Newsom has a different take, saying the syringes lying all over the streets of metropolitan areas are due to the high vaccination rate of the state. Newsom made the claim during a press conference held in front of one of his homes today. ""This just shows that more people are getting the jab,"" Newsom said in the speech. The press conference kept moving, though, as cameramen informed him there were hobos pooping in the background and shooting up heroin. Finally, it was able to resume over a green screen of Hollywood in the 1950s. ""See how beautiful and serene our cities are? Other backward places like Texas and those other Southern states don't have needles lying everywhere, because nobody is getting vaccinated. They have come out against SCIENCE."" Newsom praised the people of California for choosing SCIENCE. A hobo then passed by, somehow having gotten into the building. He was carrying a box of syringes and various bags of powdered substances. ""See? Look at this man here. What a hero! Taking the initiative and vaccinating himself and distributing the vaccine to his friends. We need more of this in the world."" The press conference was cut short as the building ran out of electricity. ",Health

""Not vaccinating your kindergartener could jeopardize their ability to make their Porsche payments, pay off their mistresses, or remain platinum members at their golf clubs. We just can't let that happen."" Experts say that while COVID poses almost zero risk to children, and the vaccine poses a small chance of making children die, the consequences of not vaccinating kids would be far worse, as drug company execs may have to dip into savings to buy a hooker. Even worse, economists warn that not vaccinating kids could cause drug company stock to dip one or two points, affecting millions of portfolios slightly. ""The science has spoken,"" said Wexner.

CDC Reminds People To Listen To All Medical Professionals Except For The Tens Of Thousands Who Refused The Vaccine,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The CDC today issued a reminder for Americans to trust healthcare professionals when learning about the vaccine - except if said doctor disagrees with the government, in which case he should be ignored and fired. ""When we are trying to understand all the pros and cons of a brand new vaccine, the one absolute must is total groupthink,"" said CDC Director Rachel Walensky. ""We cannot allow any sort of healthy dissension, especially from highly trained healthcare providers, to help guide us."" The administration has promised to make it easy to recognize unvaccinated medical professionals by ensuring they are unemployed. If one of these out-of-work doctors attempts to talk about the vaccine, the CDC has recommended citizens place their fingers in their ears and begin singing 'Baby Shark'. ""It's hard to even put into words how stupid the CDC is,"" said a local doctor who also writes for a satire site and must remain anonymous. ""I have natural immunity because I kept taking care of patients when this pandemic hit. My entire family became really ill, but those were the risks we had to take. Now hear me: the vaccine is a medical marvel. It has saved many lives, it has allowed my elderly patients to resume living - I am very grateful for it. Yet while the vaccine is very safe, it is not a zero-risk intervention. Real, significant adverse events can occur, although rarely. So for someone with natural immunity - which the latest data shows to be seven times stronger than vaccination - there is simply no reason they should be compelled into vaccination and take on that risk of an adverse event. Same with children, given their low-risk profile for serious disease, and the need for longer studies to determine potential adverse effects. The broad mandate for everyone to get vaccinated, regardless of natural immunity status, is egregiously anti-science."" The CDC has asked anyone who read the previous paragraph to please smack their heads into a wall until they forget everything they just read. Drones have been dispatched to take care of that silly doctor, who is probably hiding in Brazil. ",Health

What they saw concerned them: for one thing, there appeared to be multiple vials of a mysterious substance, all of them labeled ""Save for 2024 election."" Someone had scrawled the words on the vials in red marker, warning lab workers not to open the vials until they're needed in 2024. ""What's that?"" the journalist asked in an audio recording from her phone. ""That? Oh, that is nothing!"" replied one scientist. ""Then why does it say that on the vial?"" she asked. ""Because we want nothing bad to happen in 2024 so we are going to release the bottle with nothing in it that year. For good luck."" She then narrowly escaped with her life as she saw the lab worker pressing the room's ""release the monkeys"" button. ""This, uh, doesn't seem good,"" said one political commentator.

It also has a laser!"" said the general as he excitedly pressed a button activating a deadly laser that could cut through metal and skulls.

CDC Says A New COVID Variant May Be Needed To Effectively Bury Afghanistan News,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Officials at the CDC said today that the surprising virulence and persistence of Afghanistan news may require a whole new COVID variant to distract the country from it.

""So, we're working night and day to come up with something really scary that would make the collapse of Afghanistan seem like a Martha's Vineyard birthday party."" Some of the possible variants that officials are considering include the Gamma variant, which gives victims an extreme desire to turn green and smash; the Bro variant, which causes victims to break out in armband tattoos; and the Kung Fu Movie variant, in which victims' can no longer make their words match up with their mouth movements. Dr. Whittle said, ""Right now the leading candidate is the Germany variant, because lots of really scary things come from Germany, like Nazis and Rammstein. And if we're going to wipe the Afghanistan debacle off the front pages, we're definitely going to need something as scary as heavy metal Germans.""",Health
Immune System Criticized As Anti-Science,,,"ATLANTA, GA - The CDC has issued new guidelines that specifically call out anyone relying on a functioning immune system as being anti-science.

""Science is doing what we say to do without question, not magically getting healthy while your body functions as designed.

It is as nonsensical as it sounds."" The CDC no longer recommends worrying about your physical fitness level, eating a well-balanced diet, or taking vitamins as these are only important if you trust your immune system. The media quickly began promoting the CDC's new guidelines, calling the immune system a ""far-right conspiracy theory"" and ""fringe anti-science treatment.""

Vaccination Rates Plummet As More Celebrities Say They Won't Hang Out With The Unvaccinated,,,"U.S. - In a disastrous turn of affairs for the push to get more people vaccinated, rates have plummeted after Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities say they won't communicate or hang out with people who aren't vaccinated. Aniston has vowed to block and cease all communication with the unvaccinated, making a very strong case for never getting the vaccine. Many say they would rather die of COVID than hear from celebrities. ""So, if I don't get vaccinated, I never have to hear from Jennifer Aniston ever again? Say no more!"" said one man, exiting the line to get the vaccine in front of a Los Angeles clinic. ""This is great! Not being vaccinated now seems like one of the best value propositions of all time. Of all time!"" ""Man, not being vaccinated may be the greatest choice I've ever made. I hope all the other celebrities follow in her footsteps."" Following the announcement from Aniston, there was also a strong spike in Google searches for ""can I reverse my vaccination""? Sad! Not good!",Health
Health Experts Point To Gollum As Model Citizen For Excellent Social Distancing Practices,,,"U.S. - Health experts in the U.S. have been encountering resistance in the population as many people don't want to stop living their lives due to the virus. So, they've been searching for spokespeople to point toward in hopes that Americans will finally listen to their expert advice. Finally, they located one creature they believe is a ""model citizen"" and ""the very picture of health"": Gollum, a Stoor Hobbit who lived in total isolation for 471 years. ""If Americans would just act more like Gollum, locking themselves away from sunlight and fresh air for five centuries, we would be able to beat this pandemic,"" said one health expert, Dr. Bob Lindelhooven. ""Instead, we have people throwing massive 111th birthday parties and not even caring about what we have to say."" Gollum has been awarded the CDC's prestigious Health Hero Award for his exemplary behavior during this pandemic. Experts also pointed to Bilbo Baggins as a negative example of good health practices, as he was radicalized by QAnon member Gandalf the Grey. ""Before Gandalf, the Bagginses were very well-thought-of in the health community,"" said Lindelhooven. ""They never had any adventures or did anything unexpected."" According to researchers, though, now the Bagginses go running about without even checking the CDC website for guidance first.",Health
"Experts Warn Of New 'Cuomo' Variant That Is Dangerous To Young Women, Fatal To Elderly",,,"U.S. - Epidemiologists are sounding the alarm about a new COVID variant that is leading to increased hospitalization rates across the country. According to scientists, this new mutation - dubbed the ""CUOMO"" variant, is particularly dangerous to young, attractive women, and 100% fatal to the elderly. ""This is the most infectious - and also the grossest - variant yet,"" said Dr. Maria Bellagamba to reporters. ""It seriously creeps me out just thinking about it. If this variant doesn't make you want to isolate yourself in a locked home immediately, I don't know what will."" According to virologists, young attractive women should avoid wearing short skirts and low-cut tops, as the CUOMO variant seems to gravitate toward women who it deems are provocatively dressed. ""If you find yourself smelling nothing but the scent of garlic and marinara sauce combined with profuse amounts of cheap cologne, this is a sure sign you've been infected,"" said Bellagamba before barfing into a nearby trash can from sheer disgust. In addition to being a very pervy virus, experts say it is 100% guaranteed to murder everyone over 65. ""Sorry, there's nothing we can do at this point.

Government Promises To Wrap Up War On COVID As Quickly And Efficiently As The War On Terror,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced Monday that the Biden administration is committing to wage a war on COVID that will be as fast, efficient, and effective as the war on terror. ""Today, the Biden administration is pleased to declare an all-out war against COVID,"" Psaki said. ""If the war on terror has taught us anything, it's that if we set aside our political differences and spend a few dozen trillion dollars, there's no end to what we can achieve in just 20 short years."" The plan is entitled ""Two Decades To Stop The Spread,"" and the crux of the program revolves around three initiatives:1. Expand the Transportation Safety Administration from 50,000 employees to fifty million employees. This will allow for 100% virus screening at all public and private indoor spaces carried out with the efficiency and professionalism that we've all come to expect from the TSA. 2. Enhanced use of domestic drone surveillance for contact tracing purposes, as well as the repurposing of drone-mounted munitions to drop vaccines instead of explosives. 3. Expansion of the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay to hold our most dangerous political prisoners, such as folks who participated in the January 6 Capitol riot or those who share misinformation on Facebook. ""With these initiatives in place, we believe we will quickly crush the virus and establish the first Galactic Empire for a safe and secure society!"" Psaki said.

If it weren't so deadly, it'd be pretty frickin' rad. Man, oh man."" The new variant is double the size of the last one. It is also supersized, so it comes with larger fries and a giant sweet tea, which is a nice consolation for it being so deadly. It's a limited edition, so get it while supplies last. It also apparently had radioactive sludge spilled on it while it was being developed at the Wuhan lab, so it has developed a craving for pizza and the tendency to shout, ""Cowabunga!"" and other radical phrases. And, as we mentioned before, it's got frickin' laser cannons. Finally, it's the Snyder Cut of the virus, so it has over 4 hours of extra lung-hacking action.

CDC Still Baffled People Are Paying Attention To Them,,,"ATLANTA, GA - The CDC has once again changed course, recommending that people wear masks indoors, even those who have received the COVID-19 vaccination. Many people have reacted angrily to this decision - greatly confusing the CDC, which is used to being completely ignored. ""This whole pandemic has been bizarre for us,"" said CDC spokesman Dexter Park. ""Normally, we put out recommendations like only cook a steak well-done and only fry eggs over-hard, and people don't even pay enough attention to make fun of us, so people acting like what we say during the pandemic matters is really confusing."" The CDC is a group of bureaucrats used to working a 9-to-5 job of complete pointlessness, making lists of recommendations that are fated to be crumpled up and thrown in a wastepaper basket. Thus, the pandemic turning them into experts whose opinions matter has caught them completely by surprise. ""People keep saying our suggestions on masking are dumb and make no sense,"" said CDC regulator Lyle Howell. ""But that's all of our suggestions on everything. We have to keep making recommendations, though, to justify our existence and get a budget. But no one listens to them - not even us. So can't you all just go back to ignoring us and stop yelling at us? I'm just here until I get my pension.""",Health
Face Masks Found To Be Effective At Making You Look Like A Giant Dummy Who Doesn’t Know How Vaccines Work,,,"ATLANTA, GA - The CDC is once again recommending face masks indoors - even for vaccinated individuals. While the exact effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19 isn't known, a new study has shown that face masks are highly ineffective in protecting you from looking like some giant dummy who doesn't know how viruses or vaccines work. ""When you wear a mask,"" said researcher Norman Ryan who specializes in things that make you look dumb, ""people will often ask, 'Are you vaccinated?' And if you answer yes to that, they'll follow up with, 'Don't you know what a vaccine does?' and then stare at you like you're an idiot. In control groups without masks, this didn't happen."" Ryan also found that the amount the mask makes you look dumb varies based on the conditions in which it's used. For example, it makes you look the least stupid in a crowded indoor environment and very stupid while outdoors, and deadly stupid if worn while driving alone in a car. ""We're seeing long-term, permanent effects from wearing a mask alone in a car,"" Ryan added. ""People who see you doing that will never respect you ever again."" The CDC, though, seems unconcerned about making people look stupid. ""We don't actually care about anyone,"" said CDC spokesman Jerome Barber. ""We just like throwing out arbitrary rules and feeling important. We're as surprised as anyone that people listen to us at all.""",Health

""I'm not talking about our immune systems. I'm talking about our friends, families, and neighbors who helped us through this difficult ordeal. They are the TRUE cure for the pandemic.""""Over the last 17 months, we've laughed together virtually, cried together virtually, and even burned down several city blocks in the name of peaceful protests,"" he said. ""If we keep working together while wearing masks and staying six feet apart, there's no end to what we can accomplish.""""Though we've made great progress, we're not out of the woods just yet,"" the spokesman then warned. ""So please, continue to harass your friends and neighbors about wearing masks, report improper behavior to government authorities, and out strangers on social media whenever possible.

Republicans Propose Vaccination-By-Mail Program,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - As COVID vaccine delivery continues to decline nationwide, Republican leaders have proposed a radical solution: a vaccination-by-mail program to cover all Americans. ""Since voting by mail went so smoothly last year, we wanted to apply those same principles to our COVID vaccination program,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""Mail-in vaccines will ensure that we have the most secure vaccination process in American history!"" The Republican proposal is simple: every American will automatically receive a pre-loaded syringe in the mail, along with a COVID vaccine card. Individuals will then self-administer the vaccine and self-report their vaccination status, all from the comfort of their own homes. ""Everyone will be able to receive the vaccine without having to miss work to travel to a vaccination site where they will wait in line for hours,"" McConnell noted. ""Best of all, nobody will be subjected to any racist ID checks!""Democrats were quick to criticize the proposal, saying a self-reported mail-in vaccine program was ripe for fraud and dishonesty. McConnell quickly dispelled those notions, saying they were nothing more than a transparent attempt to disenfranchise Republicans from getting vaccinated.",Health
"China Denies Reports Of Bird Flu, Says There Are No Birds In China",,,"BEIJING - There have been reports of a human case of a rare bird flu in China, but Chinese officials have dismissed the report saying it's impossible for bird flu to be in China as there are no birds there. ""It's absurd to suggest there is bird flu in China because we have gotten rid of all birds,"" said Chinese President Xi Jinping at a press conference. ""China has complete dominance of all of its skies  -  including in Taiwan which we are totally in control of  -  so no birds would dare intrude here. To suggest otherwise is more American lies  -  just like the lies that I look like Winnie the Pooh when I in fact look like a more rugged Timothée Chalamet."" Xi went on further to say that if anyone in China got sick, it was not bird flu but ""totally regular flu"" and that no weird diseases ever originate in China and everyone should stop looking into their Wuhan lab which is only working on ""a new type of gum that never loses flavor."" The press conference was then interrupted by what looked like a number of doves flying overhead, but Xi said they were not birds but tiny airplanes flown by mice as part of their new advanced Chinese air force which could ""fend off an attack from any entity, including the American Space Force.""",Health
CDC Says Men Should Continue Wearing Masks To Avoid Catching Devastating Man-Colds,,,"U.S. - The CDC is urging American males to remain masked for the rest of their lives due to risks associated with the common man-cold. The agency noted that the man-cold is the root cause of over 600 million sick days each year. Symptoms of the common man-cold include runny nose, sore throat, coughing, crying, general loneliness, and a loss of all hope. Symptoms are usually at their worst when the man's wife or girlfriend is nearby. ""Look, we know how devastating the common man cold can be for your average male,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky explained on CNN. ""I've heard stories of men who are bedridden for an entire week with this thing. It's nothing to joke about."" A CNN poll showed an overwhelming 79% of men will follow the CDC guidelines and continue to mask up in avoidance of the man cold. Just 15% of men, mostly blue-collar types, said they'd never heard of the man cold. 6% of men said they only listen to Donald Trump when it comes to their health. ""Look, I'll mask up for the rest of my life if it means I don't have to experience that horrific cold ever again,"" explained Ryan Penta, a husband and father of one from California. ""Before 2020 I could count over 25 times I nearly died from that cold. 2020 though, was a lifesaver. I didn't get the cold once because I was masked up 25/7.

""I saw it and began to think that it's possible it could have started there, I mean I don't want to jump to conclusions because the sign clearly only says it's the 'birthplace of COVID'. That could really mean anything,"" stated a perplexed Fauci. ""It's definitely something I would send a young intern that I wouldn't care about seeing again to further investigate.""

John Cena To Undergo Experimental Spine Implant Surgery,,,"LOS ANGELES, CA - Actor and WWE wrestler John Cena announced that he will soon be undergoing a controversial new spine implant surgery after being diagnosed with a tragic case of having no spine. The startling revelation that John Cena had no spine unfolded before the nation's eyes this week when what appeared to be a strong, virile American male apologized to the communists in China for some stupid reason. Doctors at UCLA Medical Center cautioned the wrestler that a full spine implant is highly experimental and untested, since they have never seen such an extreme case that was as bad as Cena's in which the spine was totally absent. ""We've been doing spine surgeries forever, sure,"" said Dr. Kapla. ""The vertebrae and vertebral discs in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions can sustain heavy damage in wrestling and other manly activities. But we've just never seen a case like this where the spine is just gone. He's basically an invertebrate at this point after kowtowing to total communists."" ""We don't even know how he is still alive,"" echoed Dr. Holli, who is the leader of the surgical team. ""After running all the tests, he appears to be more like a squid or a jellyfish than a grown adult man, but definitely more pathetic. Perhaps he comes closest to a sea cucumber after what happened.""

Both of the other Faucis then ganged up on March 2020 Fauci, calling him an ""anti-science mask denier."" Another Fauci then appeared, and then another, and then another, and all heck broke loose, with the Faucis screaming at one another and calling each other ""Q anon crazies"" and ""progressive totalitarians,"" depending on the version of Fauci.

Dangerous Anti-Science Conspiracy Theorists To Continue Wearing Masks Outside,,,"U.S. - The pandemic has come with big changes for everyone, and in some, it's caused downright insane behavior.

The FBI is telling everyone not to approach any vaccinated person wearing a mask but to instead call authorities. They will then apprehend the individual and try to reason with the person, explaining what a vaccine is and why people wear masks so that maybe the person will understand why they should take it off.

I would stay away from computers as much as possible, and if you are around a computer, put a mask over the part where the fan vents. And as I keep saying, if at all possible, please just lock yourself in a large footlocker in your basement, as that's the safest way to ride out this pandemic."" Others aren't convinced and have made fun of Biden for his seemingly pointless mask-wearing with nicknames such as ""Dumb Biden,"" ""Stupid Biden,"" and ""Biden -- Not a Smart Man."" Still, Biden persists with his extra caution and was last seen wearing a mask alone in the bathroom while fixing his hair. ""Mirror Joe Biden could have COVID, for all I know,"" he explained.",Health
Study Finds Anyone Still Wearing A Mask At This Point Is Probably Just Super Ugly,,,"U.S. - A new study found that anyone still wearing a mask at this point is probably just super ugly. The study looked at thousands of Americans still wearing masks and thousands who have long since thrown away all their masks. The findings were conclusive: the vast majority of people who still choose to wear a mask everywhere they go were much uglier than those who are currently blessing the world by letting everyone see their beautiful faces. ""Look, the vaccine is out there, numbers are way down, your risk of dying is very, very low -- if you're still wearing a mask at this point, let's be honest: you probably have a very homely face,"" said Dr. Vance Ryder, a very handsome doctor not wearing a mask. ""You might have what we call a 'face for radio' in the business, if you know what I'm saying."" ""Like, let's just be honest here. We're not gonna judge you. If you want to keep wearing the mask because you have a sad, no-good, loser face, fine. No one is going to stop you. Just don't keep pushing for mask mandates for those who have incredibly good-looking faces."" The study also found that those who no longer wear a mask are tremendous, beautiful, ""maybe the best-looking people of all time.""",Health

He continued: ""They're deliciousanda great teaching tool for your kids to help unbrainwash them from the liberal lie that humans never rode a T-Rex.

Fauci Calls The Bill Of Rights A 'Public Health Crisis',,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - During an interview Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci called the Bill of Rights in our Constitution a ""public health crisis."" Along with climate change, racial injustice, and student loans, the Bill of Rights should be declared a ""public health emergency,"" Fauci said in his comments on an interview with CNN. ""This Bill of rights is a disaster for public health,"" Fauci said. ""People can go where they like, say what they like, and gather to worship how they like. The Constitution doesn't even say anything about a virus. It's very dangerous, very anti-science. The pandemic was a good testing ground for us to figure out how to handle public health crises such as this contagious document. So now we know how to take down something deadly and viral like the Constitution."" ""I hereby call on our leaders to help us stop the public health crisis known as the 'Bill of Rights.'"" Fauci then called for Americans' rights to be locked down for the next two decades to ""slow the spread"" of liberty.",Health
"Man Who Trusts Science Wears Mask While Outside, Helmet While Driving, Water Wings While Taking A Bath",,,"WALTHAM, MA - Kenny Stone always trusts the science. That's why, despite getting vaccinated, he's listening to Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC and continuing to wear a mask, even when outside. ""There's still a risk I could get the virus out there,"" said Stone. ""It's a pretty large number -- like ten million... dividing a one -- so it's just right to be cautious."" Stone takes similar precautions when driving, always wearing a helmet. ""You could crash at any time,"" explained Stone -- who was also wearing a mask while alone in the car to protect against the less than a billionth chance of viral infection in that situation. ""That's why, in addition to a seatbelt, you need to wear a helmet when in a car. It's also a good idea when using stairs. That's just science."" Stone also stayed cautious when taking a bath, always wearing water wings to help prevent drowning. ""People drown all the time,"" Stone said. ""Not usually grown adults in bathtubs, but it happens. This is just trusting the science and taking known precautions."" Stone then put on a helmet to prepare to stand up from the bath. Dr. Fauci agreed with Stone's assessment. ""You have to be careful with these things,"" he said. ""I would also wear water wings when anywhere near anyone else taking a bath, in case you fall in. And wear a mask when bathing.

This mask is handy for conservatives who live in blue states where they still have to wear masks at Walmart, Target, and the few other stores that are still open after lockdowns. ""We found that many people just accidentally left their masks on, and everyone who saw them assumed they were Democrats, which is obviously devastating,"" said one of the inventors of the mask, Bill F. Parton. ""Now, people who glare at you for thinking you're a Democrat will take a second look, read your mask, and chuckle at you for forgetting to take off your mask. They might even give you a hug for being such a cool guy."" ""Thanks for this awesome mask, guys!"" said one man in Southern California. ""I kept leaving Stater Bros. and forgetting to pull off my mask, and everyone thought I was one of those liberals who live up in L.A.

Man Can’t Wait To Get Vaccine So He Can Go Back To Isolating While Wearing A Mask But Now Doing So While Vaccinated,,,"SAN DIEGO, CA - Carl Watson can't wait to be finally vaccinated against COVID-19. ""I'm just giddy with excitement,"" he told reporters through a closed-door while wearing a mask. ""As soon as I get both doses, the first thing I'm doing is putting on a mask and going back home to be completely isolated -- but I'll be isolated while vaccinated, so I'll be even safer!"" Watson is one of the millions of people desperately seeking the vaccine so they can go on and change no behavior whatsoever. ""We can't let our guard down just because we're vaccinated and fully immune to the virus,"" Watson said. ""Now I can isolate with an even more focused intensity. I might start wearing three masks."" While many unvaccinated people have gone back to living their lives as normal, those warier of the virus like Watson see behavior like that as murderous and evil. ""Even with the vaccine, there's still a minuscule chance I could get it or spread it,"" Watson explained. ""You never do things when there is a minuscule chance of harm. That's why I never drive a car or take a shower, since I could slip and die. That's just being courteous."" Watson may make one trip out after getting the vaccine: to Home Depot to buy bricks and mortar for the purpose of immurement. ""Vaccinated and permanently sealed inside a brick wall,"" Watson mused. ""You can't follow CDC guidelines any better than that.""",Health
Vaccine Recalled After Two People Who Took It Fell Down A Manhole And Died,,,"WASHINGTON D.C. - The Food and Drug Administration has asked for all Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to be recalled and destroyed after two different people who took the vaccine died, both having fallen down open manholes within a week of taking the drug. ""We just want to have an overabundance of caution here,"" explained Doctor Anthony Fauci. ""That's why all Johnson & Johnson vaccines are being destroyed, and anyone who has already taken the vaccine is being placed under house arrest to keep them away from streets with manholes."" Fauci said they're also considering a pause on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as a few people who have taken those have slipped on banana peels. Some are criticizing the recall of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine since nearly seven million people have taken it and only two have fallen down a manhole, making the risk seem minuscule -- especially compared to the death rate of COVID-19. Also, not everyone is sure those deaths are related to the vaccine and believe they may in fact be caused by the carelessness of construction workers. Dr. Fauci has dismissed these criticisms. ""Everyone wants things to make sense, but I think we've made it clear that's not how we approach things,"" said Fauci. ""And who is in a big rush to end this pandemic, anyway? We all like wearing masks and staying home. We especially like seeing me on TV all the time. Or at least I know I do.""",Health
Vaccine Will Now Be Offered In Continuous IV Drip You Carry Around For The Rest Of Your Life,,,"WORLD - The world will return to a new normal now as every major manufacturer of COVID vaccine has begun offering a continuous intravenous drip that you will have to carry around for the rest of your life. The ingenious new vaccine delivery system from Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca will slowly and continuously drip the vaccine into a person's bloodstream presumably granting immunity to the coronavirus, so long as it is never removed from your body. When your IV bag runs out of vaccine fluid, you can simply go back to your local pharmacy for a refill at a nominal fee. ""Immunity? Yeah, of course,  that's the idea,"" said Pfizer's Chief Business Officer. ""Americans desperately hope that if they are stuck by enough needles that they can go back to work, fully open their businesses, and have their kids in school again, and this continuous drip is an option for that."" The IV drip version of the vaccine comes in the wake of many prominent politicians signaling that life still couldn't return to normal despite the millions of normal vaccine jabs many Americans had already received. However, if they hook themselves up to this continuous drip system, they might have a shot at that someday. ""Now this is a game-changer, and I think it will do a lot of good, though experts don't foresee life getting back to normal until at least late 2022,"" said Dr. Fauci when asked about the new state-of-the-art vaccine delivery system. At publishing time, Dr. Fauci confirmed that though this IV delivery system is a great measure in the fight against COVID-19, Americans must continue to socially distance and wear masks at all times in public.",Health

""We tried to get the troops to wear masks and such, but they continued to go outside and save humanity without the slightest care for COVID-19.""

Dr. Fauci Reminds Everyone That We Will Only Have To Wear Masks Until Humans Evolve Organic Face Coverings At Birth,,,"WASHINGTON, DC -  After causing an uproar for constantly extending how long masks will be required, Dr. Fauci has finally provided some much needed answers. In a recent interview, Dr. Fauci has once and for all explained that we will only need to wear cloth masks until humans evolve them. ""As soon as humans naturally evolve an organic nose and mouth covering at birth, then we can start dialing back on the mask mandates."" clarified Dr. Fauci. ""This isn't going to be some endless, arbitrary policy. We have clear, scientific measures informing us when masks are obsolete."" ""Well, that is a huge relief!"" said Cathy Pittman. ""We just have to trust the science and everything will be better in no time! I was starting to think the masks were going to become permanent parts of our lives!"" In a statement, Dr. Fauci gave his estimate for when he thinks that the evolved facemasks might become a reality. ""We're working with a purely scientific, definitive timetable now. We just need exactly, right at, about 2-5 millionish years, give or take, to probably evolve facemasks, for the most part."" When pressed further, Dr. Fauci continued by saying, ""I know that time will be here before you know it, but I don't think life should start returning to normal until humans are born with at least 2 naturally occurring face masks. So just another quick 5 million years!""",Health
Dangerous Conspiracy Theorist Doesn't Believe Vaccines Work,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - A dangerous conspiracy theorist based in Washington doesn't believe vaccines work, concerned sources reported Tuesday. He spouted his deadly rhetoric in a speech today, going on about how even if Americans get two doses of the vaccine they should keep triple-masking, avoid going outside, and stay in their homes and die alone. Reports indicate that the conspiracy theorist isn't just a no-name cult leader on YouTube or something but is incredibly popular, with millions of people hanging on his every word. ""It's really scary how many people are listening to this dangerous, anti-science conspiracy theorist,"" said one scientist. ""We're trying to get people to get vaccinated, and this guy comes along and starts spewing his nonsense about how vaccinated people could still get the virus and so can't go to theatres, baseball games, or restaurants for at least a year or two. He's really harming public discourse on the issue."" ""Dangerous, extremist, fringe rhetoric like this is really harmful to our efforts to vaccinate a large portion of the population and get back to normal. Be really careful of wackos like this guy."" What's more, the conspiracy theory-pushing extremist is clearly a grifter, as images surfaced of him going to a baseball game and taking his mask off throughout last year.",Health

"To Fight White Supremacy, Coca-Cola Discontinues Vanilla Coke",,,"ATLANTA, GA - To fight white supremacy, Coca-Cola has discontinued its controversial product Vanilla Coke, saying it is ""too white"" and must be dismantled as part of the company's continued emphasis on eliminating whiteness from society. All varieties of Vanilla Coke, from Cherry Vanilla and Orange Vanilla to Vanilla Vanilla, will be pulled from shelves as part of Coca-Cola's push to lessen whiteness. ""We now recognize that our Vanilla Coke product perpetuates whiteness in a racist, problematic society and harms our efforts to make people less white,"" said a Coca-Cola executive Friday. ""Anything with even a hint of whiteness must be eliminated. We now realize that we were, in fact, part of the problem all along as we promoted the alt right-adjacent flavor of 'vanilla.'""

Revealed: Biden Shows Off His High-Tech Basement Lab Where He Invented The COVID Vaccine,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Biden offered journalists an exciting look at his secret basement lab this week, where he has been working hard since his January 20th inauguration to develop a COVID vaccine. ""When I became President, as my mother always used to say, we didn't even have a vaccine!"" said Biden while giving the tour.

People across the country breathed a sigh of relief as Congress finally got its act together and compromised to make the mask payments happen. ""I know this isn't $2,000 in cash, but it is still significant,"" said Nancy Pelosi. ""You can use the masks to stay home and stay safe. You can make fun crafts with them. You can even barter with your masks to purchase extra bread, water, or ice cream for your family."" Senator Chuck Schumer suggested making ""fun little daisy-chains"" with the masks and playing jump rope with them, as long as you stay inside your house. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the payment, saying that you ""can't do too much"" when it comes to a stimulus bill and that every American should get infinity masks, though she warned that masks can be tricky and that you might strangle yourself with them. An additional benefit to getting $2,000 in masks instead of cash is that they won't depreciate anywhere nearly as quickly as the American dollar.",Health

CDC: 'Just Because You Got The Vaccine Doesn't Mean You Should Go Outside Or Ever Experience Joy Again',,,"ATLANTA, GA - The CDC has issued a reminder that just because people get the vaccine, that doesn't mean they should go outside, experience human interaction, or have any kind of joy or happiness in their lives ever again. ""We noticed people were getting the vaccine and then just assuming because vaccines are designed to make people immune to viruses that they are immune to the virus. Then, they were doing crazy things like going outside, interacting with other people, and being happy,"" said a CDC spokesperson. ""And all of this because doctors and scientists kept pushing the vaccine as though it were a cure-all solution that would make you immune to the virus. Well, that view is now considered anti-SCIENCE. And if you disagree with SCIENCE, you are literally murdering grandma. Literally. Like with a baseball bat."" The newly revised guidelines indicate that people who have not yet been vaccinated should stay home, masked, in a bubble, forever. Those who have been vaccinated should do the exact same thing, except they are allowed to have a smug look on their faces for being vaccinated. Except you can't see the smug look. Because of the mask. What is the benefit of getting vaccinated, then? ""Well, there are many benefits,"" the CDC spokesperson said. ""But the best benefit of all, of course, is that you're on the right side of history. But still, stay in your home and be sad and depressed forever.""",Health
Fauci Says We Can Fight Virus By Wearing Up To Three Leeches,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - As the science continues to evolve at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to slow the spread of COVID-19, its experts are now recommending a good old-fashioned bloodletting, saying we can curb the effects of the virus by wearing up to three leeches at once. The ancient practice has fallen out of favor in the modern medical community, but the CDC and Dr. Fauci now say the technique can make a real difference in curbing the spread of the pandemic. ""If you can get leeches, that's probably the best way to do it,"" said Dr. Fauci. ""But we've seen any form of bloodletting makes a difference. One leech is good, but I see no reason why two or three leeches wouldn't work even better."" In a study of 100 subjects, those who let out most or all of their blood were two times more likely to test negative for the virus than those who kept their blood and survived the study. ""This is a huge breakthrough,"" said study leader Grant Stoddard. ""All this time we've been telling people to put mask on top of mask on top of mask, and what we should have been doing is bloodletting."" Five minutes later, Dr. Fauci said that ""actually, leeches do nothing and might kill you, and I never said otherwise.""",Health
Scientists Predict Humans Will Simply Be Giant Rolling Balls Of Masks By 2024,,,"U.S. - Experts are now predicting that humans will make a giant evolutionary leap forward in the next few years, moving from walking around on two legs to rolling around in a giant ball of masks, thanks to ever-evolving mask guidelines. ""At the current rate of mask growth, humans will evolve to just be rolling around in a giant ball of them within three years,"" said evolutionary biologist Bob Carson III. ""As the mask arms race accelerates, we're already seeing humans wearing three, four, five, six, even seven masks. Projecting that rate out, assuming logarithmic growth -- let's see, carry the one... yep. We're all just gonna be big mask blobs."" Scientists believe humans' legs will slowly begin to atrophy as they no longer use them to walk around, as they'll be able to roll in the mask balls. Freeways will be converted into fun slides where you can just roll to work, and doors will be turned into Hobbit hole-style round entryways so you can just roll on into the office when office buildings open up again in a few years. One competing study is challenging the idea that humans will be rolling around in a ball of masks and instead found that the entire earth will just be a big ball of masks hurtling around the solar system and smothering all human life within.",Health

""That's why I developed this handy 'Wheel of SCIENCE' for us to spin every morning, so people can really see that this isn't just me saying whatever pops into my head!"" ""Now-- let's give this puppy a spin!"" he exclaimed as he gave the wheel a mighty turn. ""What will it be today, gang?"" asked a giddy Dr. Fauci. ""'Masks Cause Bladder Cancer?'

I've been keeping this little guy here for this very moment,"" said Dr. Fauci, reaching into an aquarium and plastering the surprised sea creature's tentacles directly onto his face. ""AAAA!!! AAA!!! THE - mmrghh - INK!! AAA!!!"" screamed Dr. Fauci as he thrashed on the floor. The journalists watching on Zoom stared in shock, then went straight to work spreading the news of Dr. Fauci's latest advice to the masses. The government media channel dedicated a segment to the updated recommendation, complete with each CNN anchor hand-selecting their own octopus. After some hilarious banter about how bad other people are, Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo slapped on their respective octopi and promptly collapsed on the floor into heaps of screams and ink. Still, being the professional mouthpieces that they are, they managed to garble out, ""THIS IS - AGHH! - WORKING PERFECTLY!! DON'T KILL GRANDMA!!!""",Health

""We've tried face masks, we've tried double masks, triple masks, face shields, giant hamster balls -- is it time that we try an anal mask?"" It's unclear if you can even contract COVID through your behind, but many officials from the WHO and the CDC are backing the measure ""just because it will be fun to see if anyone goes along with it."" ""Honestly, if we told people to jump up and down and pretend they are kangaroos to fight COVID, they'd probably do it,"" said Dr. Fauci, chuckling. ""Or if we told them to close their businesses and lock themselves in their houses for a year to stay safe.""

""It is our hope that by providing the consumer with these warnings, fewer Americans will be exposed to the harmful ideas about gender and conception that biology teaches,"" Biden said in a press conference. ""Think about students who just open a biology book, not aware that it's a gateway drug to all kinds of hateful ideas, like that men are men and women are women. Heck, they might even be opposed to the idea that a child should be able to transition genders or that men should be able to beat the tar out of women in MMA."" ""Not on my watch, Jack!""

Here are seven great ways you can stay safe, brought to you by SCIENCE! 1. Wear 749 masks.This is literally 746 times safer than triple-masking. We did the math. It's SCIENCE. 2. Tie a plastic bag around your head.Now, the virus has no host it can infect because you are no longer breathing, because you are now dead. SCIENCE! 3. Bury your head in the ground like an ostrich.Take a cue from nature, and also SCIENCE. Ostriches have been doing this for thousands of years and as far as we know, none of them have contracted Coronavirus. Experts say it works even better if you flap your arms and squawk. 4. Get attacked by an Alien Facehugger.According to SCIENCE, Facehuggers are almost impossible to remove once attached and their looks will scare everyone away, helping you with social distancing. If anyone tries to get within 6 feet of you, you can fling alien acid-blood at them. In addition, acting as a host for a Xenomorph means you will never have to worry about getting the virus! 5. Cover your entire head in Flex Tape.There is an almost infinite number of uses for Flex Tape, and scientists have used SCIENCE to discover that it forms an impenetrable seal over your nose and mouth. Only $19.95! 6. Figure out how to turn your head inside out and retract it into your body like a turtle.This takes a lot of practice, but Shaolin monks and Mitch McConnell insist it can be done. Try it today-- for SCIENCE. 7. Lock yourself in your home until you're isolated, unemployed, sick, anxious, and severely depressed, in hopes that the virus goes away someday. There you have it. Grandma will now live forever.",Health
Triple-Masker Looks Down On People Who Only Double Mask,,,"U.S. - Health experts are now recommending that people double mask -- place a second mask over the first mask -- to better protect themselves from the virus, or maybe to protect others from themselves possibly having the virus (it's still kind of unclear). Many are denouncing this recommendation, especially triple-maskers, who find it wholly inadequate. ""I guess I'd only double mask if I didn't really care about not killing grandma,"" said the extremely muffled Mark Carlson, who was wearing three masks at once. ""But I have three masks on because there's an ongoing pandemic and I care."" Triple-maskers point out that three masks are 50% more effective than two masks. ""If the virus somehow makes it past two masks, then we're all done for,"" said Karen Walker, although her exact words were unclear as it was kind of hard to hear her through three masks. ""But not if you have a third mask. The virus wasn't expecting that."" ""Really, I can't see any reason to wear only two masks unless you're some kind of misanthrope who wants to see everyone die,"" she added.

""People who get the vaccine but fail to post it on Facebook will still be vulnerable to infection and must mask up, stay home, and stay safe."" Experts later clarified that even if you post a Facebook selfie, you should still ""mask up, stay home, and stay safe"" because no one is really sure exactly what's going on or how any of this works. According to the latest research, selfies on Twitter or TikTok videos are also acceptable, but a Facebook selfie is the most effective method of ensuring your vaccine works.

Moderna Vaccine Rejected Since It Also Works On White People,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In a blow to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Moderna's vaccine has now been rejected by the FDA. This was done because of a recommendation from the CDC, which found out that the Moderna vaccine is effective in preventing white people from getting COVID-19, something they're concerned could increase racial inequality. ""The possibility that the vaccine could cause more white people to survive the novel coronavirus is just too risky,"" said CDC spokesman Steve Coleman. ""It's almost like Moderna is one of those 'All Lives Matter' people. We're telling them to go back to the drawing board, though, and make a racial justice vaccine that only works on minorities."" There have been suggestions that when deciding who will receive the vaccine, doctors just shouldn't give it to white people, but the CDC says that still leaves too much of a risk that white people will somehow obtain doses of the vaccine,  as white people are ""wily."" Video has already emerged of Mike Pence, a notoriously white man, getting the Pfizer vaccine. The creation of a new vaccine that only works for minorities could take another year or more, during which most of the country will once again have to lock down.

Effectiveness Of Masks Questioned With New Study Showing High Death Rate For Stormtroopers,,,"U.S. - Common wisdom tells us that masks slow the spread of COVID and that everyone who denies that should be burned at the stake, but a new study has brought that wisdom into question, as it shows an extremely high death rate from one of the groups most diligent about wearing masks: Stormtroopers. The Empire's Stormtroopers are almost never seen without masks on, and yet they die at an alarming rate. ""One would really expect them to do well in a pandemic,"" said research scientist Gerald Pittman, who specializes in studying what happens when you breathe through your mouth and nose. ""They should almost never transmit the virus, and yet they are constantly dying."" Pittman does say some of those deaths are due to laser blasts, falling, or laser blasts resulting in falling, but one would still expect to see some difference from Stormtroopers' mask-wearing. Not only are Stormtroopers dying at a high rate, but other diligent mask-wearers are experiencing high fatality rates, such as ninjas, Old West bank robbers, and Shy Guys. ""Wearing a mask may not be the silver bullet many think it is,"" said Pittman. Pittman also speculated that there are other options besides mask-wearing that might help survivability, such as dexterity to dodge laser blasts, knowledge of kung fu, and diligent hand-washing.",Health
Time Traveler Arrives From 3000 A.D. And Oh No! He's Still Wearing A Mask!,,,"NEW YORK CITY, NY - The world celebrated this week after a time traveller from 3000 A.D. arrived for the first time in New York City to share his wisdom with the world. That celebration turned to despair after the man emerged from his time machine wearing a COVID mask, revealing that they will still be worn 1000 years from now. ""Greetings, primitive humans!"" said the traveller who introduced himself as Gorb 235-X. ""I am here to learn your ways and share news of the future!"" Unfortunately, hardly anyone could understand him since his face was concealed by a surgical mask. When asked about it, Gorb replied, ""Oh -- you mean this thing I'm wearing on my face? I really don't know why we wear them. I'm pretty sure humans have been wearing them for thousands of years. All I know is that if a cyborg civil enforcer catches us without them we get vaporized, so I guess we just wear them."" The world collectively cried out in anguish at the realization that they would be forced to wear a mask for the next 30 generations. ""I'm sorry to disappoint you,"" said Gorb 235-X. ""But can someone please tell me where Tom Cruise is? I'm supposed to assassinate him before something terrible happens. Just trust me on this.""",Health
Bernie Sanders Confused After U.S. Beats Cuba To Producing COVID Vaccine,,,"BURLINGTON, VT - Bernie Sanders expressed bewilderment this week after the announcement that two separate U.S. drug companies have successfully produced a vaccine for COVID while socialist countries like Cuba and Venezuela have not yet announced such a breakthrough. ""I happen to believe,"" said Bernie to supporters. ""That Cuba and Venezuela invest more in their healthcare than we do. They are more compassionate. They are more advanced. There's no way they haven't produced a vaccine already. They are probably just keeping it secret so American capitalist billionaires don't steal it!"" Cuba has assured the world that they produced a ""better, cheaper"" vaccine than the American drug companies but they misplaced it and they're sure it will turn up soon. Venezuela also claims to have a 100% effective treatment for COVID but that it was stolen by a pack of feral cats. They have assured the world they will find it shortly. North Korea claims they have had a vaccine for years but they don't even need it because people never get sick there. Sanders is calling for complete government control of healthcare in hopes that America will catch up to these other, more developed countries.",Health
Chicago Mayor Limits Gatherings To Ten People Unless You're Involved In A Drive-By,,,"CHICAGO, IL - Now that Biden victory parties in the streets have ended, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is announcing a new round of lockdowns to help halt the spread of something bad that nobody can remember anymore. To help prevent transmission of the deadly something, the mayor has announced that all gatherings of more than 10 people will be prohibited -- unless, of course, you're going to be involved in a drive-by shooting. ""Let me be clear, you probably shouldn't be shooting people,"" said Lightfoot in a press conference. ""But if you really have to shoot some rival gang members, and you need more than a crew of 10 to do it, we'll make an exception just this once. Don't go crazy though."" In addition to banning gatherings of more than 10, the mayor has also banned Thanksgiving, thankfulness, hugging your Grandma, baking cookies for your neighbor, and playing the ""I got your nose"" game with your small children. Experts predict that an increase in drive-by shootings will actually prevent the spread of viruses since there will be fewer people around to get infected. ""This is what we have to do to be safe because 'science' or whatever,"" said Lightfoot. ""Just do as I say and no one will get hurt. Unless it's in a drive-by.""",Health

Evolution In Action? This Baby Was Born With A Mask On His Face,,,"SANTA CLARITA, CA-Creationist parents Matt and Zoey Zimmerman got the surprise of a lifetime this morning when their baby boy came out of the womb wearing a cute little mask on his face. Jared Elija Zimmerman entered the world this morning at 4:51 A.M., and even though he had evolved into a Covid-immune, mask-wearing superhuman, his father still wasn't convinced that evolution is real. ""Oh, give me a break,"" Mr. Zimmerman said. ""There's no such thing as evolution. This is obviously just a gross mutation. I mean, look at this kid. That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen."" Jared's mom, however, had other feelings. ""All this time I thought God created the universe in six days. But now, now I understand what they were trying to teach me at public school. Humans came from monkeys, and monkeys came from trees. We adapted to our environment, and now my little Jared has adapted to his: the strange new world we live in where everyone has to wear a mask until they die."" After further investigation, doctors discovered a few more mutations in little Jared Zimmerman. The newborn had self-washing hands, which washed themselves every ten minutes; the little guy was also born with a bottle of Lysol attached to his hip; and most impressive of all, the newborn emitted a strong magnetic force which kept anyone from outside of his household six feet away from him at all times. It's now completely obvious: evolution is real.",Health

In fact, Cuomo says he has scientists developing a vaccine that will render President Trump's vaccine ineffective. ""We are doing great here in New York, and I have done everything perfectly,"" Cuomo told the press, ""just ask anyone in the media -- especially my brother Chris. So we don't need Trump coming in here and mucking everything up with his vaccine that's been unproven except for multiple tests by the FDA."" Cuomo hopes to have the vaccine-vaccine ready next week and will make it mandatory for all citizens of New York. ""No one is getting cured by Trump,"" Cuomo stated. ""Not on my watch."" Other governors have expressed interest in Cuomo's vaccine-vaccine, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom. ""Trump is just trying to endanger everyone by giving them the freedom to leave their houses when they want and do what they want,"" Newsom said. ""Californians just aren't ready to abandon my guidance on their everyday activities."" President Trump seemed unperturbed by the resistance to his vaccine, though.

Pandemic Officially Over,,,"U.S. - After almost a year of suffering under a devastating killer pandemic, America was relieved to learn that the pandemic is officially over.

""But we truly underestimated just how powerful Biden's healing powers were. We are proud to declare this pandemic officially over. It went away. Just like a miracle. Praise be!"" As it turns out, Biden's secret plan to deal with the pandemic was simply to get elected. At this point, it's not entirely clear how Biden's election is related to the departure of COVID, but scientists said they don't really feel like looking into it because they're so tired from doing so much science all year without any breaks. Biden has been awarded the Nobel Prize in every category for his brilliant handling of the virus. In a speech to a captive audience that was actually captive because they were there under contract, Biden said: ""I'm glad I was finally able to deliver you all from the horrible, you know -- the thing!""",Health

""Unlike some people who hate science and want people to die, we here in California love science and don't want people to die,"" said Newsom during the announcement.

Trader Joe's Makes Baffling Business Decision To Ignore Angry People On The Internet Who Don't Even Shop There,,,"MONROVIA, CA - Trader Joe's is baffling business and finance experts with the bizarre decision to ignore angry people on the internet who probably don't even shop there. The angry internet mob called for Trader Joe's to be boycotted until they change their extremely offensive labels such as ""Trader Jose's Taco Shells."" After initially suggesting that they would change some of the offensive names, Trader Joe's decided just to leave everything as-is and not worry too much about what a very small portion of the internet thinks. ""It's crazy -- why aren't they listening to this mob that probably makes up a full 0.001% of their customer base?"" wrote one Huffington Post finance blogger. ""I mean, we clearly stated that we were angry. And then Trader Joe's was like, 'OK, but we disagree with your opinion. Have a great day.' It's like, rude! When we say we are upset, companies are supposed to do whatever we want, even though we don't even patronize their business."" The unsound decision on the part of Trader Joe's means that the company only really cares about people who actually shop there, a bold move by the grocery store chain. Analysts are watching with great interest to see if the move pays off.",Health
Trump Voters Now Wearing Hydroxychloroquine Necklaces To Ward Off Dangerous Liberals,,,"U.S. - Trump voters who say they are being increasingly targeted and harassed for supporting the president have turned to wearing hydroxychloroquine necklaces to ward off Liberals. Liberals, who are notoriously terrified of the tiny white pills, tend to cower and run away in terror upon seeing hydroxychloroquine. According to clinical studies, Trump voters who wear necklaces strung with hydroxychloroquine are 63% less likely to be attacked by a leftist on the way home from work or the grocery store. ""We didn't know what else to do,"" said local Trump fan Judy Jugglebumkins as she loaded a cart of GOYA foods into her trunk. ""Thank God for hydroxychloroquine. I take it for my aches and pains, my arthritis, and my 'rona! And ever since I started wearing my extra pills around my neck, liberals scream and run away! It works great!"" According to witnesses, an Antifa activist who approached Judy in the parking lot immediately covered his eyes screaming ""AHH!!! IT BURNS!!!"" before fleeing the scene. Anonymous sources in the Trump campaign have noted the effectiveness of the drug, and are floating the idea of hanging Hydroxychloroquine in the doorways of voting places in November.",Health
Dr. Fauci Recommends Encasing Your Entire Body In Bubble Wrap To Protect Against Coronavirus,,,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - At a press conference Wednesday, Dr. Fauci suggested that Americans cover their entire bodies in bubble wrap to protect against coronavirus.

""You will no longer have to worry about death by coronavirus, though I'm just a medical doctor and can't speak to any other risk factors this may introduce."" Of course, Dr. Fauci says that he and other Washington elites are exempt from the recommendation. ""I mean, other people should do that, not me,"" he said, chuckling. ""I can go to a baseball game and stuff without worrying about protecting against that kind of stuff, because I'm a doctor. The virus and I are on good terms."" Some doctors quickly held a press conference to point out the dangers of wearing the new full-body bubble wrap cocoons, but their video was banned from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for containing dangerous medical misinformation. At publishing time, Fauci had also pointed out that the bubbles are really fun to pop and admitted that may have informed his recommendation.",Health

While Ocasio-Cortez stayed up all night studying for the test like a good student, most of the other people at CVS said they hadn't studied at all. Ocasio-Cortez explained that most of the people at the pharmacy seemed to be conservatives, so it's no wonder they didn't study.  ""What we're seeing here is a complete lack of effort from conservatives, and it's embarrassing,"" she explained.

Study Finds Most People Just Wearing Masks To Avoid Sea Of Judgmental Glares,,,"U.S. - A new study found that the primary reason people are wearing masks in public now is not to stop COVID-19 but rather to avoid the sea of judgmental stares. 92% of Americans surveyed said they're wearing the masks not to stop the spread of the virus but just so they aren't publicly shamed. ""Honestly, I couldn't care less about the 'rona, but I just want to get in and out and pick up a few groceries without getting glared at like I'm a serial killer who personally murdered hundreds of thousands of Americans,"" said Bob Cristoff as he went into a Safeway.

The science is unsure on how effective masks are at stopping the coronavirus, but the science all agrees that they do stop people from screaming at you that you want grandma to die.

Nation's Hospitals To Replace Doctors With Celebrities Doling Out Medical Advice,,,"U.S. - Hospitals across the country are trying a new tactic to combat COVID-19: replacing medical doctors with Hollywood celebrities doling out advice. The Hollywood celebrities will simply lecture patients with their vast knowledge from their acting careers, tell them to do better, or sing ""Imagine"" for really bad diseases. Hundreds of thousands of doctors were informed their services were no longer required, since Hollywood celebrities are doing a great job of telling us how to fight disease. ""Many of these celebrities have played doctors, nurses, or other medical professionals during their careers, so they're definitely the people you should listen to,"" said one hospital administrator in Beverly Hills as he handed a medical doctor a pink slip, since she was being replaced by Natalie Portman. ""Their smug, smarmy attitudes as they tell you things only a medical doctor should be saying just mean that they're the right people for the job."" The strategy is really working, some say.

Doctors Recommend Locking Down And Reopening Repeatedly Until Everyone Has Nervous Breakdown,,,"U.S. - A survey of leading physicians unanimously agreed that the best response to COVID-19 is for the government to lock everything down, then reopen, then lock down again, then reopen again and to just keep doing that until everyone completely loses their minds.

""I'm confident we can crush the collective human spirit into a fine powder with just a few more lockdowns and reopenings."" Fostein says that humanity is on track to go into a collective nervous breakdown after several more lockdowns and reopenings, which doctors agree will lead to a new age of compliance. ""At that point, we can just strap everybody down, sedate them, and do what needs to be done to get America back on track."" Doctors defended the ""lockdown-reopen infinite loop"" strategy, citing the fact that not everyone listens to absolutely every word they say without question. ""We are tired of being questioned,"" said Dr. Whiltern of Newbury Medical Authority. ""Also, watching everybody go nuts is going to be a blast."" Most physicians think that the initial stages of mental breakdown have already begun. ""People have been losing it quite a bit, sure.

Asking For Context Of Thirty Second Video Revealed To Be Racist Dog Whistle,,,"U.S. - A new study revealed that anyone who watches a thirty-second video of a tragic incident on the internet then immediately asks what the larger context of the situation was is a vile racist deserving of the most horrendous death imaginable. ""It's simple,"" said leading researcher Daniel Thomas of the Garby Institute. ""Your immediate reaction should be unhinged blood lust. You should call for the bad man in the video to be strung up in a desert, covered in fire ants, doused in battery acid, kicked repeatedly in the face, his flesh torn from his bones, fed to jackals, his corpse filled with rabid weasels and run over repeatedly with a cement truck. That is the proper response, no further inquiry is needed."" Research showed that questions like, ""who are these guys?"" and ""Why was this happening in the first place?"" and ""what happened thirty seconds before this? Is there more video?"" are clear signs of racist inquiry. Experts recommend immediately jumping to conclusions, rioting in the streets, and completely losing your ever-loving mind upon viewing any 30-second video of a tragic incident.",Health
Weird: Guy Injected With Bill Gates’ New Vaccine Suddenly Thinks Internet Explorer Is The Greatest,,,"MEDINA, WA - The effort to find a vaccine for the coronavirus reached a milestone today after philanthropist Bill Gates unveiled his brand new ""Coronavirus Cure v 2.1.13"" to the world. It's now being tested on human beings for the very first time. The first test subject, Ryan Flenderson, is now protected from the coronavirus for all eternity thanks to science and the philanthropic genius Bill Gates. There is one small side-effect being reported - though experts insist it's nothing to be concerned about. Within a few hours of receiving the new vaccine from Bill Gates, Ryan began loudly singing the praises of Microsoft's new Internet Explorer. ""Have you seen this browser!?? So beautiful! So elegant! Fast! Secure! It's everything I've ever wanted in an internet browser!"" he said with a glazed look in his eyes. Mr. Flenderson's friends claim Ryan has been an avid Apple fanboy for years. ""We want the old Ryan back,"" one friend said. ""This just isn't like him. It's totally weird."" A quick Bing search has revealed that this side effect is not dangerous or harmful to people in any way. When told about Microsoft's amazing search engine called Bing, Ryan fainted with joy. Experts are predicting billions of compulsory Bill Gates vaccines will be available for an eager public by the year 2047. Until then, shelter-in-place orders will remain in effect.

Murder Hornet Named New President Of Planned Parenthood,,,"NEW YORK - A massive Asian Murder Hornet was named President of Planned Parenthood today.  The move came after Planned Parenthood realized the killer insect had the exact qualities they'd been seeking to take the company in the right direction. Namely, lots of murder. The Murder Hornet entered Planned Parenthood Headquarters around 10 a.m. yesterday ""just looking for an entry level job,"" according to sources.  But when leadership caught wind of the murderous hornet's employment interest, they jumped at the opportunity. ""It was a sign from our Mother Spirit Margaret Sanger,"" explained former President Alexis McGill Johnson.  ""So I called the Murder Hornet up to my office right away.  She actually took the time to murder all six people in the elevator on the way up.  A real go-getter.  I had no choice but to step down immediately and name her the new president."" The Murder Hornet got right to work, outlining her basic murdering method, and hiring on more Murder Hornets by the hundreds of thousands.  All females of course. It was late in the day, however, when things took a turn for the worst.  The new President of Planned Parenthood caught wind of a controversial statement made by former President Alexis McGill Johnson about a week ago.  Apparently Johnson had mentioned that Joe Biden, a Democrat, should address sexual assault allegations made against him, a Democrat.  These kinds of statements would not fly under the new leadership. ""Let's just say Alexis is no longer with us,"" said one of the few remaining non-insect staff members.",Health

Lockdown Made Permanent To End Traffic Deaths For Good,,,"U.S. - Many states have begun extending their lockdowns permanently in a bid to end traffic deaths for good. States found that as they locked everybody in their homes, car accidents virtually disappeared. So they did the obvious thing and decided the lockdowns should be made permanent. ""A million people die in auto accidents every year, and if you want people to be able to go outside, you obviously want all these people to die,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""Why do you hate people so much, anti-science bigots? I'll wait for an answer."" Cuomo then just stood there, arms folded, waiting for an answer, but since it was a live stream, he stood for hours before aides finally cut the feed off. Scientists believe the lockdown can also end all deaths from various other sources: ""Together, we can defeat death itself,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom as he announced the state would be under lockdown permanently. ""O traffic deaths, where are your sting?"" Unfortunately, new projections indicate the number of people who will die of starvation and other lockdown-related causes may offset the decrease in traffic deaths.",Health

Latest Computer Model Predicts Between 0 And 12.6 Billion New COVID-19 Deaths By Summer,,,"U.S. - After several embarrassing and widely divergent revisions to the coronavirus projections of infection, hospitalization, and death rate used by government officials around the world to justify shutting down the global economy, experts at Johns Hopkins have now deployed a state-of-the-art super-scientific computer model and have determined that between 0 and 12.6 billion people will contract the disease and be completely dead by summer. ""The panel of experts came together to give Americans the true picture of what we are looking at,"" said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as he pointed to lots of completely accurate, up-to-date charts and graphs from the study. ""This is not just the flu. This is going to wipe out between 0 and 12.6 billion people before summer hits."" As a result of the new predictions, the CDC has revised their guidelines for essential workers to not only continue to wear face coverings and regularly take their temperatures, but to also begin praying to whatever higher power they choose as they await the impending death of everyone on June 1. The CDC website was updated with an infographic informing Americans they had a final 34 days to ""slow the spread."" ""We told everyone that there would be no ventilators and that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed across the entire nation by April, even with extensive social distancing recommendations and shutdowns in place,"" stated Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House's coronavirus task force. ""It didn't happen quite that way, so we went to get better numbers. Now it looks like in this new expert modeling that everyone will actually die by June 1. We are super serious.""

CDC Advises Politicians Keep At Least 6 Feet Apart When Pointing Fingers At Each Other,,,"U.S. - The Center for Disease Control and Prevention warned politicians this week to stay at least six feet apart when they point fingers at one another. The warning comes as federal, state, and local governments continue to use the Coronavirus as a convenient excuse for continued finger-pointing. Finger-pointing, while occasionally unwarranted, is a classic political move which always proves that the person you are pointing at is at fault, and probably really stupid. ""Politicians need to lead by example,"" warned CDC Director Robert Redfield.  ""They've got to stay six feet apart when pointing fingers.  If they're not careful, every single politician in the United States could be infected with Coronavirus and die.  And nobody would want that. Nobody."" Democrats and Republicans did not respond well to the warning, each saying it was the other side's problem, not theirs.  ""It's all their fault!"" yelled Nancy Pelosi, as her dentures flew out of her mouth and into Dan Crenshaw's water.  ""They started it!"" she said, retrieving her dentures and sticking her finger into Crenshaw's chest. But it didn't stop there: several politicians from both sides of the aisle jumped into the pointing match, which lasted a full hour of pay for each member of Congress. Rand Paul was the only member to be pointed at by every member of Congress. ""All I did was draw up a plan for us to stay six feet apart while pointing fingers at one another,"" Paul explained.  ""I just figured I'd try to be productive.""",Health
U.S. Reports Largest One-Day Increase In Cases Of Trump Derangement Syndrome,,,"U.S. - America suffered its highest one-day increase in cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome yesterday, adding 317,259 new cases. This brought the number of U.S. cases to roughly 59 million, while worldwide cases of the deadly disease increased to 110 million. The peak in cases was brought on by President Trump's growing urgency to reopen the economy and allow people to go back to work. Scholars have noted that this is equivalent to slavery. With the sharp increase in Trump Derangement Syndrome, U.S. officials see no real timeline for reopening the minds of Democrats nationwide. ""We can't take any chances here,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. ""It could take months. It could take years. What we may see is the gradual reopening of Democrat minds on a state-by-state basis."" While some statistics have suggested a plateau in cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome, other sources suggest the increase in cases has just begun. ""Our models have been quite accurate from day one,"" claimed Ron Whitley of the University of Washington.  ""And we don't see a peak here. Our data suggests a slow increase in cases through the summer, and then a big peak in cases about November 4 or so.""",Health

""Everything is still great here,"" said President Xi Jinping to selected members of the press. ""Nothing alarming has happened here... and certainly not for a second time."" Xi was wearing a hazmat suit, but he claimed that was because it was laundry day and that was the only thing he had left that was clean. The American press felt no need to ask any follow-up questions. A number of ""Have You Seen Me?"" posters depicting a coronavirus and giving a number to call were spotted around Wuhan, though again Chinese officials say there is nothing unusual there and nothing to worry about and if you develop a sneeze, isolate yourself -- preferably in an airtight room -- immediately. The Wuhan lab that adjusted the sign has been studying bat-related viruses for some time, though the main thing they've learned so far is how not to store viruses.",Health
Skydiving Accident Ruled Death By Coronavirus,,,"LAKE ELSINORE, CA - Local man Brett Garfield was tragically killed in a skydiving accident yesterday.

""Brett's 42-year-long life was tragically cut short yesterday, presumably by coronavirus, as he plummetted into the ground at a high rate of speed,"" said a Riverside County health official. ""Darn you, coronavirus! How many more will you take from us? HOW MANY MORE!?!?"" As Garfield's body was scraped off the ground with a giant medical spatula, which is how they take care of these things, a coroner stood by and took notes on his clipboard. ""Yep, looks like coronavirus to me. If he'd only socially distanced himself from the ground or worn a mask, he'd have been OK. Add him to the numbers, boys."" ""I guess you could say he"" -- at this point, he put his sunglass on for dramatic effect -- ""didn't understand the gravity of the situation.""

Arkham Asylum Releases All Inmates Amid Coronavirus Fears,,,"GOTHAM - Arkham Asylum has freed all its inmates to prevent the spread of coronavirus, sources within the Gotham Police Department confirmed earlier this week. The prisoners were at risk for contracting COVID-19 and so were let go to take some of the strain off the Gotham prison system. After freeing them, interestingly, there was a rise in crime, a side effect the Gotham P.D. claimed they didn't see coming. ""Yeah, in hindsight, maybe this wasn't the greatest idea,"" said Commissioner Jim Gordon as a giant vine burst out of the ground and began wreaking havoc downtown and Bane punched walls just for fun. ""Letting criminals out can sometimes cause a rise in crime, and we didn't exactly see that coming."" ""HahahahahahahaHAHAHA!!!"" cackled the Joker as he was let out. ""Now it's time to kill the Batman!"" Medical officials believe killing the Batman could actually help keep further coronavirus outbreaks from occurring and so will turn a blind eye to the Joker's evil plan this time. Within two days of being let out, they were all caught again by Batman but then broke out again, before being caught again and then breaking out again. ""Yeah, we're not great at this whole 'running a prison' thing,"" said the warden.",Health
Medical Experts Confirm Democrats Have Developed Herd Immunity To Sexual Assault Allegations,,,"U.S. - Medical experts were excited to announce today that Democrats have achieved herd immunity against sexual assault allegations. After getting accused of sexual assault thousands and thousands of times for so many years, the Democrats developed some kind of antibodies against the allegations. Researchers are taking blood samples to isolate the antibodies to see if a vaccine can be developed for other groups. ""It's amazing -- the entire Democrat demographic is entirely immune,"" said one researcher as he took blood samples from Joe Biden. ""After conspiring with the media to squash any accusations that pop up, it seems, over time, Democrats have been able to develop a kind of herd immunity to any allegations."" Biden has been an important case study for medical experts' work, as he can publicly sniff people's hair and inappropriately touch many people on camera and still be entirely protected from any accusation whatsoever. His DNA is being studied for a possible breakthrough for other politicians. With time, other political parties may be able to use the vaccine, but for now, it seems only Democrats are immune. Other political parties and at-risk conservatives are being advised to quarantine so as to avoid any allegations until a vaccine is discovered.",Health

Fauci has been a controversial figure, with many questioning his response to the coronavirus outbreak. This new study shows there's one simple way for him to put people's criticisms to bed: wearing a head mirror, referred to as a ""giant doctor disk thing"" by the vast majority of the nation. ""I just don't know if I can trust him -- he doesn't have one of those big CD-looking things on his forehead,"" said Lily Bryers, 42, of Snidersville, Texas. ""Putting on one of those and maybe wearing one of the heart-listening thingies around his neck would go a long way toward dispelling my doubts about him."" ""Dr. Mario wears one, and I trust him. I'm just saying, it would help."" The study also confirmed that people would really like it if he could wear a white medical coat and hold a clipboard. In addition, people said their trust of him would increase greatly if he would hit the president's knee with one of those miniature rubber hammer thingies. ""And would it kill the man to tell somebody to say 'Ah' and then stick one of those popsicle sticks down his throat?""",Health

When confronted on why the supplies intended for Jakku instead had hyperspace coordinates set for the Mustafar region, Vader responded, ""I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further."" Across the galaxy, attempts to slow the spread have led to more cantinas closing their blast doors, forcing bands to broadcast their performances via hologram.

Professionals Work Tirelessly To Discover Which Political Party Should Be Blamed For Virus,,,"U.S. - Hope for figuring out which political party to blame for the novel coronavirus could be on the horizon, as professional task forces have been assembled across various public and private areas of expertise, and vigorous research is underway.

""We gotta get to the bottom of this,"" President Trump said in a recent statement, in a rare moment agreeing with his opponents in the Democratic Party.

Italy Totally Fine Thanks To Universal Healthcare,,,"ITALY - A new report has found that Italy is doing completely fine with no problems whatsoever thanks to its lauded universal healthcare system.

Millennials Finally Take Coronavirus Seriously As Avocado Toast Supplies Run Out,,,"U.S. - Many millennials haven't been taking coronavirus seriously, continuing to go out to crowded concerts, theme parks, and doorknob licking conventions. But finally, many 20-40-year-olds are treating this crisis with the gravity it deserves as the ingredients to make avocado toast begin to dwindle at their local grocery stores. First, many of them went to their local cafes where they can spend $15 on a slice of the delicious toast. But the cafes were either shut down or completely out of bread and avocados and couldn't fill their orders. So, they did the unthinkable and went to the grocery store to get the stuff to make avocado toast on their own. ""No bread... no avocados... I can't even! I have literally lost the ability to even! My evening capability is totally gone!"" cried one Portland woman as she began to freak out at her local supermarket. ""This! Is! Serious!"" Other essentials were missing from the shelves too, like LaCroix, kombucha, and quinoa. ""And can anyone tell me where the pumpkin spice latte aisle is!? My, like, barista usually makes it for me! It must be in the vegetable aisle."" But nothing is making millennials freak out as much as the lack of avocado toast. Many are even saying we should switch to socialism, where the shelves are always empty like this but the government provides lines you can wait in for avocado toast.",Health

""As far as we can tell, these claims have no basis in reality,"" said one Italian health professional.

The sauces will bring the flavors of Chick-fil-A home so that consumers can enjoy any meal with that Chick-fil-A flavor and experience.

Popular New 'Noah Diet' Has You Eat Two Of Every Animal At Every Meal,,,"TONASKET, WA - Move over, keto. Step aside, carnivore diet. There's a new meat-based diet taking the Christian world by storm, and it's straight out of the Bible. Its adherents call it ""the Noah diet,"" and just like the popular story of old, it involves two of every animal. The man who made the diet popular is pastor Floyd Embry of Raging Grace church in Tonasket. He claims the diet is 100% God and scripture-based. ""Look at the original text in Genesis 6. God says 'Bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.' This term 'kept alive' can also be translated 'kept on ice' or 'kept delicious.' Now here's another part people miss in this verse. God clarifies and says, 'You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten (reiterating what he just said about two of every animal) and store it away as food.' The Bible could not be more clear on this."" Some believe the ark is an allegorical tale meant to symbolize the proper diet. It is like a big, wooden, large intestine and the animals represent food. The diet calls for adherents to eat two of every animal at every meal. While some complain the price would add up on all that meat, Embry says, ""you can't put a price on good health."" Embry is also developing new Noah milkshakes that contain two of every animal blended together in one delicious, easy-to-prepare smoothie. ""We're also working on a jerky line,"" Embry told reporters. It is wise to check with your doctor before shifting to the Noah diet. If the doctor denies the authenticity of the Noah diet, rebuke them in the name of Jesus for their unbelief.",Health
