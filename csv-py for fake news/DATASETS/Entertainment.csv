Can’t Cook Won’t Cook – Meghan Markle,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60724-cant-cook-wont-cook-meghan-markle.html,2025,"Pretzels bought from Walmart. Take them out of the cheap packaging, put them in a fancy plastic bag to give to your paid off “friends” who you just met on set 5-minutes ago. Yes folks, it’s another offering from the vapid Meghan Markle.
A fucking fruit salad rainbow, cut some fruit and place it onto a fucking platter in someone else’s elaborate, expensive kitchen. Sprinkle a few flower petals on your amazing fruity creation. Et voila, Netflix’s $100 million down the shithole.
Nobody gives a flying fart about this shit, this is so awful it would be preferable to have root canal for four hours straight.
Fake, vacuous syrupy plastic shite devoid of any substance for an overprivileged grifter with a serious chip on her fucking shoulder. In fact, the chip is so big soon she’s going to need a wheelbarrow for it.
Who wants to watch a bunch of greasy sycophantic Californian “Oh my gawd” bootlicking paid puppets fawning over some z-list celebrity just because they got compensated with shitloads of wonger? Do these people have any fucking dignity? It seems Meghan Markle doesn’t have any dignity herself.
And that awful ghey music they play in the background is truly sickening, who the fuck chose that crap? That’s the shitty music you hear on Mark Zuckerberg Meta presentations with the ukuleles and whistling. It’s better to ram some sharpened pencils into your ears.
Watch it for a laugh, give it your full support because  Netflix will lose more subscribers  for pushing this dire trash. They’re having a laugh at the expense of paying subscribers by presenting them with such gauche saccharine excrement. This show is actually sad, it’s disgraceful in its flaunting of wealth 99% of people will never see or experience in their lives. It’s a disgusting display, showing off something like this Meghan Markle malarkey when there are millions of people really struggling to live their lives under seriously hard economic circumstances. This just makes people detest her with even more vehemence and vitriol.
What this atrocious pampered narcissist needs to do is bring in a kid from the ghetto into that kitchen and feed them some beans or some ham hock, and forget about sprinkling the motherfucking flowers over the food or presenting the poor kid with flowers inside ice cubes.
Wow! I never knew that you can arrange fruit on a plate! $100 million for that? Nice work if you can get it. Oh, and where’s dumbo? Go back home and take some of that jam and rub it over your smug, self-absorbed face whilst crying like a baby. You failed. Big time…or, actually, has Meghan Markle really had the last laugh — at your expense, of course?",Entertainment

LOS ANGELES NEWS: Roasted Smelt Fish Recipe,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59574-los-angeles-news-roasted-smelt-fish-recipe.html,2025,"Sourced directly from Northern California, where the Delta smelt live, these delicious fish are great for grilling on  hot fires . Be sure you turn the heat up real hot before cooking your Smelt.
Ingredients:
1 pound (450 g) fresh smelt fish, cleaned (heads optional) 
4 glugs of greasy hair gel 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
1 lemon, thinly sliced 
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) 
Lemon wedges (for serving)
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven or Grill on a Barbecue 
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil.
Prepare the Smelt Fish 
Rinse the smelt fish under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Place them in a large mixing bowl.
Season the Fish 
Drizzle the olive oil over the fish and toss to coat evenly. Sprinkle the sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika over the fish. Gently mix to ensure the seasoning coats each fish.
Arrange on Baking Sheet 
Lay the smelt fish in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Avoid overcrowding so they roast evenly. Place lemon slices over and around the fish for added flavour.
Roast the Fish 
Roast in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, or until the fish are golden and slightly crispy around the edges. The fish should flake easily with a fork when done.
Serve 
Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and squirt an entire fucking load of the greasiest hair gel you can find over the whole dish, then serve with additional lemon wedges.
Tips:
Smelt fish have a mild flavour and edible bones, so they can be eaten whole, including the skin and bones. Pair with crusty bread, a fresh salad, or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.
Enjoy your roasted smelt fish—a simple, flavourful dish perfect for any occasion!",Entertainment

Now the Daily Mail is reporting that a celebrity and another celebrity are not only indeed dating – but have been for ‘well over a year.’

‘The celebrity couple are dating each other right now, as in at this moment in time,’ it was added.

"The  Daily Squib Anthology, a Wayward Christmas Fart From the Wilderness",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54270-the-daily-squib-anthology-a-wayward-christmas-fart-from-the-wilderness.html,2023,"It is still not too late to purchase a Christmas price reduced copy of the Daily Squib Anthology, which are currently selling like hot idioms from a frazzled copy of the Oxford Dictionary.
Showcasing fifteen long years of internet satire, the book, much like the Daily Squib, is a wayward satirical fart from the wilderness. You see, it’s because we do not comply, we do not conform, and we certainly do not kowtow to any rules laid out by media monstrosities we are rather unique in our delivery of ye olde Juvenalian satire. The Squib does not follow ‘fashion’ in any way or shape.
If you are somewhat of a non-conforming maverick, give the book a go, because the main thesis of the entire anthology is a brazen middle finger pointed at pretty much everything and everyone within this pallid malevolent woke society foisted upon us by deranged control-freaks and authoritarian pseudo-Marxists who seek to take over every facet of our lives.
We give no quarter to these autocratic dictators sitting in their mansions with their ill-gotten gains or the weak fuckers below them who follow without any question as they are steered over the cliff one by one in an orderly manner. The ultimate philosophy of our book is that there must be another way than  this , than what we have at the moment, and we must not as a human race revel in mediocrity and putrid banality but choose a path of supreme virtuosity and maybe some forgotten freedom.
If you do thus crave freedom from all of this malodorous manure ejaculated from the puckered anuses of the supreme narcissistic controlling self-appointed pompous dictators of all thought and righteousness — then buy the book, one of the last remnants of freedom left — and this is why they hate us so much, and why they have done everything to try to shut us down simply for exerting our pure human right to freedom of speech and expression.

"Expert Shares Ways to Save Money on Netflix, Disney+, Amazon and Apple TV+",https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55360-expert-shares-ways-to-save-money-on-netflix-disney-amazon-and-apple-tv.html,2024,"As  the warmer weather is almost here, and the constant rain hopefully subsides a little for a few months at least, you may have noticed that many household bills are increasing. Every year, providers up the prices of bills including TV, mobile phones and broadband inline with  inflation . However, there is a way to save money on these things, so please read on.
Added to that, several streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ have also updated their membership rates and, as many of us now subscribe to several streamers at once, this means we end up paying more each month to watch all the stuff on these streaming platforms. Netflix now costs £10.99 for its Standard plan or £17.99 for Premium and has clamped down on members sharing their accounts, with Disney+ confirmed to be following suit later this year.
Over at Amazon, Prime Video members must now fork out an extra £2.99 a month for an ad-free subscription. Luckily, there are loads of ways to cut down costs, and I’m going to show you how.
Switch off the fucking telly and do something else
This simple method of switching off your TV will keep more money in your pocket, and is known as ‘switchingoffing’. Here, we explain what this means, how it works and most importantly how much you can save.
What is switchingoffing?
Even with all the time in the world, we wouldn’t be able to watch the endless amount of shit and utter crap on streaming platforms. So rather than have subscriptions to these money-grabbing parasite streaming services – Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video and Apple TV+ – simultaneously, cancel all the fucking subscriptions and switch all the mind-numbing shite off.
Even before you take advantage of other ways to cut down costs, at its most basic this could save the average household hundreds of pounds a year on streaming costs that you and your family really do not need in any shape or form. Along with dumping all of the parasite paid streaming subscriptions, the most important thing to dump is the fucking  TV licence tax . Don’t worry, you can still watch free streaming services if you really must, but you will not be able to watch anything from the current state of the BBC, which is no loss at all.
Not only does this save money, but by the time you have ‘switchoffed’ all the paid services over the year you’ll find much more new activities to enjoy and get loads more value from doing other things with your life that are way more productive. Don’t forget to also limit your smartphone usage by buying a very basic package just for calls and a little surfing. This could save you literally thousands of pounds of money that would otherwise be wasted on utter shite.
Remember, by switching off all this unnecessary crap that is being pushed on you daily, you not only save some money, but you also preserve your frame of mind and are not polluted by substandard banal crap that literally rots away your mind. Read a fucking book instead. Enjoy your life, and don’t fill your mind up with useless junk and woke bullshit that hinders every part of your being.",Entertainment
Feminists Now Want “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” Banned,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53032-feminists-now-want-austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me-banned.html,2023,"Puritan, psychotic misandrist 5th Wave feminists now want the wonderful comedy film “Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me” permanently banned and all copies of the movie burned on a bonfire along with every man on the planet’s testicles.
“SHAG”
“It is a disgusting carnal misogynistic film where Austin Powers shags his way through multiple female spies and the worst part of it is that this horrid man says the word ‘shag’!” a feminist member of establishment media news revealed.
Caught in the middle of this debacle is GB News who claims to be a news company that is not part of the ‘establishment’ but actually are part of the establishment and have turned into a puritan edifice of hyper-sensitive politically correct sewage infested shit piles of inequity. A sad turn of affairs, as they once had some modicum of reasonable promise.
“As is the case with establishment news organisations and media who are pandering to wokism and 5th wave feminists, the core of this problem comes down to the advertisers and woke companies, who dictate everything. The advertising agencies have all now gone extreme woke and are invariably tied to their  ESG  scores and the WEF. This sort of soviet political correctness and puritanism is a direct influence from the pieces of shit who run advertising agencies these days. These ad companies are now run by stasi virtue-signalling woke arseholes who pander to ESG obsessed companies that commission ads from their companies. Any form of un-woke naughtiness on a media company that shows ads is now completely cancelled. Wokism as a weaponised soviet censorship system thus limits the scope of human expression and commerce. Every advert created today is an abhorrent travesty and insult to the original concept of advertising, and a fucking disgrace,” a former advertising executive from the 90s revealed.
The Spy Who Shagged Me
Well, there it is. You cannot say the word ‘shag’ anymore, you cannot say you want to shag a woman, or inversely you cannot say you don’t want to shag a feminist ideology spouting woman.
No more shagging for Austin Powers, either…looks like Dr. Evil really did win in the end…",Entertainment
When Everyone’s Supposedly Famous,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52535-when-everyones-supposedly-famous.html,2023,"Andy Warhol predicted quite prophetically in the 60s that everyone would have their five minutes of fame in the future. That prophecy has pretty much come true, however the levels of fame have changed drastically and have been watered down somewhat.
Famous on the internet
The internet has made billions of people supposedly famous simply by eradicating privacy and making people more accessible and trackable than ever before. The new generation have taken to the loss of  privacy  like a duck to water and have never known a world where privacy was a thing people valued very much.
The fickle fleeting fame people find on the internet is a very fluid state of affairs where one minute some influencer or vapid Instagram model may recieve millions of hits and go viral for a minute or so before going back to semi-obscure fame on Ye Olde Internet(s). These dilettantes have to go back to buying more social media followers and paying dodgy sites selling views bot traffic and subscribers. If you have enough money on the internet, you can be really ‘famous’.
Fame does not mean anything if everyone is famous, much like if there was gold everywhere, it would be as valuable as any other ordinary rock. This is why real fame has sort of done a U-turn, and the only people who are left out of the roll call of the internet are the actual famous ones.
If you have a Facebook or Instagram or any other social media page with your real name, you are a compromised individual who is now supposedly ‘famous’, and are now especially known to the millions of shark companies/intelligence agencies/police mining your data, so they can target you better to sell you cheap toxic plastic trinkets from China, or arrest you at three in the morning.
The internet dilutes fame, especially on social media. Now on Twitter, any wanker can buy a blue check mark for $8 per month and be recognised next to some inconsequential rapper or influencer. Your name is next to this guy or girl, it is just a name in a list of billions on the social network, and this is the reason fame is diluted. The worst part of this is when people who acquired fame before the internet come onto a platform, and they start to spill the beans to everyone about their haemorrhoids, or have a hissy fit because they suddenly realise they are just another name in the list of suckers sucked into the data mire of manure, no one has respect for these people ever again. Your previous fame and status have been summarily sucked out of you ass first. With all mystery and enigmatic fame ruined on social media, many previously famous people are thus reduced to nothing but being another Joe or Jill talking about their toenails or some other personal detail that no one wants to know. As for your opinions? No one cares because it is all data swimming around a big fucking vacuous bowl. You see that, skip that, see another bit, skip to another piece of info, all completed in seconds. With people now having their brains altered via the internet, there is little or no patience, which filters into real life as well. Things, tasks, have to be completed immediately, and as for traffic on the roads, woe betide you if you don’t move away from the lights quick enough.
When everyone’s famous, the truly valuable people are the one’s out of the list or are anonymous. They are the rare commodity, the valuable rare diamond or bar of pure gold worth something more than the others. Supply and Demand.",Entertainment

The inseparable duo have built up a loyal social media following of more than 167,000 fans by documenting their five-star getaways to hotspots including France and Mexico.
Pho has also been showcasing the piece of shit’s extensive clothes collection, which includes Chanel silk scarves, turtleneck sweaters and statement sunglasses.
Pho gave birth through her anus to the six-pound poop during the coronavirus pandemic, but the duo didn’t set off on vacation together until 2022.
The piece of shit’s first trip was on a four-hour flight to Lake Louise, Alberta, but he has since gone much further afield.
His debut international trip was to Paris – where the pair stayed at the Hotel Louvre Saint-Merde, dined at the iconic Café de Dégueuler and visited the Eiffel Tower.
Next, the influencer piece of shit went to Mexico where he enjoyed poolside massages, luxurious meals and endless treats.
‘I never wanted to travel without him because he’s my baby boy,’ Pho King Quant told Fox.
But the piece of shit, who usually dines on a raw food diet including homemade diarrhoea broth, does not travel light.
‘Since he was a little nugget, I’ve liked to match his clothes to my neutral aesthetic with trench coats and denim, but my piece of shit is partial to a Hawaiian shirt when on holiday.’
His doting owner even created a poopy fashion brand called The Turd Collection with the website offering items that are adorably named, The Winnit Coat, Casually Cool Dingleberry Sweater and Tropical Turd Skidmark Shirt.
Pho King Quant admitted that although there were additional costs associated with travelling with her shitty friend, he was ‘more than worth it.’  Besides, being an influencer piece of shit brings in serious sponsorship money with companies paying up to $50,000 for a single post on Instagram, and like all influencers, it’s all tax-free revenue.
Best Decision
She told the outlet: ‘Shitting out my piece of shit was the best decision, and he’s like my perfect match.’
Pho continues to showcase his ‘sassy personality’ online as his Instagram bio proclaims: ‘I like to dress up, travel and dine at blue bottle fly-friendly restaurants.’
Influencer Website
The turd’s personal website states: ‘I feel super comfortable in front of the camera. When I am not modelling, I love naps and walks.
‘I know the following tricks: sit, stay, down, come, boop, chin down, dance, pray, rollover, kiss kiss, and cuddle time.
‘I also love to hit up Shit Friendly Patios and go on Shit Friendly adventures with my Family.
‘I love giving mommy kisses. I have one shitty fold that likes to flop down most of the time!’
Discussing what could be next for the duo, Pho King Quant told Fox News: ‘We would also like to go back to Europe to visit Italy, and we will go back to Mexico because we loved it so much.’
She is also keen to take her piece of shit to Beverly Hills in order for him to experience a real-life version of the movie Beverly Hills Smelly Turd.",Entertainment

The family friend said: “[Harry] actually suggested that they use a mediator to try and sort things out, which had Charles somewhat bemused and Camilla spluttering into her tea.”
They added the Queen Consort told the Duke his suggestion was ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and that they would resolve their differences within the family.
So, who was going to be the mediator that Harry would bring along to the royal family?

LA Rapper Manages to Survive For More Than 6 Months,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47640-la-rapper-manages-to-survive-for-more-than-6-months.html,2022,"An Inglewood rapper has miraculously managed to survive for 6 months more than the usual life expectancy of rappers, according to reports.
KTITZ-TV, Channel 13 identified the rapper as Half Inch, who has released an album in May called “Bitch Bangin'”
The Los Angeles County Mayor’s office on Tuesday confirmed that a special medal of survival will be given to Wakandaishquan Jefferson, Half Inch’s real name.
Half Inch, 36, is one of the few rappers who has not been shot and killed in Los Angeles County in less than a month. On Sept. 11, rapper Fuque U, whose real name was Kuntekentay Mandingo Johnsons III Esq., was fatally shot during a botched robbery for the 30-year-old’s jewellery while he was having lunch at Roscoe’s House of Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles.
On Sept. 14, Little Dee Smalls, 23, whose real name was Barackz Trayvon Richardson, was shot and killed in Compton along with 29-year-old Julius Four Ounce Yeyo Jr.
The shooting tally on rappers for September in LA County was down this year with only 89 rappers shot. Statistics from September 2021 show over 145 rappers were shot and killed in LA alone.
The LAPD revealed that the life expectancy for an African American who declares themselves a rapper or even dares to release an album is less than 6 months.

The Daily Squib can reveal the former Health Secretary, 44, was primed and ready ‘to carry out another covid’ on the campmates.
ITV bosses were left reeling at the erroneous discovery.
Mr Hancock, who lost the Tory whip last week when it was announced he was joining the cast of the show, also has access to his laptop.

“It seems Hancock’s plan was simple. Sedate the other contestants. Claim they had a virus, then up the dose, snuffing the fuckers out. Boom! Take the prize money,” an ITV worker revealed.
Earlier on today, Matt Hancock was filmed eating an entire bowl of crunchy crocodile anuses with a big silly grin on his face.",Entertainment
Meghan and Harry Hired Photographers to Document Need For More Privacy,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48599-meghan-and-harry-hired-photographers-to-document-need-for-more-privacy.html,2022,"“We wanted more privacy, so we hired a crew of cameramen and photographers to make a documentary on our need for increased privacy,” Harry revealed in the latest trailer for the couple’s Netflix series.
Life is terrible when you live in a $15 million Montecito mansion with 16 bathrooms, and vast manicured gardens around you.
Invasion of privacy
“We left Britain because we wanted more privacy from the horrid British people. That’s why you have to watch our new documentary, where photographers and video cameras record our every moaning session about our privacy being breached,” Meghan Markel remarked whilst being filmed in the privacy of her Montecito mansion.

James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of the Water,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48731-james-camerons-avatar-the-way-of-the-water.html,2022,"If you are thinking of taking the family, or friends, or partner to a film of this calibre, you must, and we insist…must…watch it on IMAX 3D. As a piece of work created by Cameron and his crew it is an amazing experience with 3D on an IMAX screen.
Folks, in these times of utter depression and misery, this is what we need, an escape from the burden of reality, and it is James Cameron’s meticulous cinematic wizardry that will take you into a fantasy world of blue for three hours and twelve minutes. Hollywood needs to move in this direction of creating grand entertaining fiction.
The message pretty much given in this sequel is that humans generally suck shit, sure not all humans but especially the corporate military industrial complex conglomerate monopoly business people who basically bulldoze over everything to build fucking car parks and shopping malls over nature reserves and native homes.
This is basic cowboys and Injuns stuff. The good guys are obviously the natives and the bad guys are the harpoon gun toting cowboys.
As for Edie Falco from the Sopranos, we were expecting her to suddenly come out with a plate of gabagool, and chastise Tony for the latest whacking of some wise guy.
The dialogue? Forget about that; sure it’s simple but that is not what the film is about. Films like this are about pure action and visual entertainment with an underlying message — that’s it.
The amount of processing power to render this film must have been huge. The CGI at points did have its flaws, but for a fantasy sci-fi the attention to detail was pore deep, like pores in the skin texture and lighting effects. The human to alien interaction was almost perfect, there was not much textural or granular difference, although in 3D, sometimes the tracking or frame rate was a little jumpy.
If you don’t detest humans after watching this, then you ain’t human. You must go and watch this film, a serious addition to Cameron’s backlog. It is the perfect seasonal entertainment that will entertain.",Entertainment
Failure of Meghan Campaign to Ruin the Royal Family Leaves Her Shattered,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46065-failure-of-meghan-campaign-to-ruin-the-royal-family-leaves-her-shattered.html,2022,"After being unceremoniously booed on the steps of Saint Paul’s Cathedral and driven off back into the obscurity she fully deserves, Meghan Markle’s overall plan to ruin the British royal family was in tatters.
“You could see it in her malicious fake smiling face, this nefarious implant into the highest echelons of society and tradition had lost her battle. The people love the royal family and Her Majesty the Queen, and Meghan’s evil plans to  besmirch  their reputation had come full circle back onto herself. It was as if the royal household held a mirror up towards Meghan and her disgusting lying attempts to soil their honour,” an observer at the scene recalled.
Meghan Markle and Harry returned to their McMansion in Montecito, California, a broken and disgraced couple of grifters who seem to have lost their edge.
The Netflix extravaganza they are trying to push is now on the ropes. Without the royal connection, they are just simply two ordinary people somehow living in a 16-bathroom faux mansion replete with cheap looking Californian Mexican furniture. Already, Netflix has shed hundreds of thousands of subscribers and may lose even more if they even dare to push the turgid preaching woke Sussex disaster.
The augurs do not bode well, and the universal karma has slowly come home to roost for Meghan and Harry. If Netflix and Spotify had an ounce of balls they would sue for breach of contract and recoup at least some of the money spent on this tawdry conniving couple of con artists. Even many  Americans are bewildered  as to how these two have kept their royal titles despite their utmost efforts to ruin the royal family.",Entertainment

The gated mansions holding Hollywood glitterati are all closed, and the streets are now full of tourists. Apart from twiddling his thumbs and thinking of England, what can poor Harry do in this plastic land of fakery?
According to some Montecito insiders, the bored former royal has been pining for a pet of some sorts to keep him company in the vast 16 bathroom mansion with cheap Mexican furniture.
“Meghan is usually out either at Oprah’s or with her woke friends on shopping trips to Rodeo Drive spending as much of the Netflix money before they ask for it back. The couple are seriously worried that Netflix will ask for the money back as they have not delivered anything, so their plan is to spend all the money, and when Netflix asks for their cash, they’ll say it’s all gone,” the insider revealed.
The kids the couple have allegedly spawned are usually with one of the Mexican nannies, and thankfully out of sight and sound.
This is why Harry has bought a Guenon monkey from a private breeder in Santa Barbara. Guenons are medium-sized monkeys that are about 16-22 inches tall and weigh 5-15 pounds on average. They are friendly monkeys but as with all pets they need a lot of care, and this suits Harry because he is frankly lonely and isolated in Montecito.
According to one of Harry’s new American chums, he calls his new monkey friend, “Willy” and so far the pair have bonded very well.
“Harry talks to Willy the monkey a lot and has even constructed a large holding pen for the primate where he can swing around. Harry also likes to take Willy into his study where he reads it colouring books as it jumps around the room,” one of the servants revealed.",Entertainment
Harry and Meghan Back to Oprah For Another Tell-All Show,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46362-harry-and-meghan-back-to-oprah-for-another-tell-all-show.html,2022,"The Sussexes are planning a new tell-all show with Oprah helped along by their activist actress friend Janina Gavankar. Gavankar who is half-Indian is guiding the couple, specifically Meghan on what to say and how to act during the performance.
Seen being driven by Harry, Oprah’s house is only a three-minute walk from the couple’s Montecito mansion, but in the interests of climate change it was deemed improper to walk but instead use a convoy of gas guzzling SUVs to make the short journey.
Naturally, for extra effect the couple called every photographer from LA to Alaska to cover the short trip in order to fuel more fear in Britain’s royal palaces.
Harry and Meghan are devout climate change activists who travel regularly in private jets that emit large amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Their most recent trip was on a Bombardier Global 6000 at a cost of $200,000 from the UK to the US.
Ding Ding Round Two
Industry insiders reveal that the latest meeting with Oprah is a plan to seal the charges of ‘racism’ against the royal family and reveal details about the alleged appalling treatment the couple received during their UK visit.
Meghan Markle who cut off her own father for talking to the press, has no qualms about manipulating the media and press herself for her own ends.
“The plan is very simple. It’s basically round two with auntie Oprah. Forget about Netflix, for the couple, live television is where it’s at, and the couple have put Netflix on hold forever. For the Duke and Duchess Netflix was just a way to get some quick cash off the chump executives promising them the world whilst delivering only crumbs. Obviously the naive Netflix execs were duped and fell for the ruse hook line and sinker. Now Oprah is the one they really want to deliver the juice to, and the others they will throw a few bits of junk just to shut them up,” a KRC PR Media exec from LA revealed.
There are numerous PR teams and media companies working with the Sussexes to not only elevate their standing but to denigrate and ruin the British  royal family.
“On Meghan’s orders Harry is doing his best to finalise the public shaming of the royal house of Windsor. The two were not going to Oprah’s house for an organic self-sustainable cup of fucking coffee. They were going to pitch the dirt, to plan their next move so that they will once again steal the limelight from Windsor and cause as much damage as they possibly can.”
CBS executives have been clamouring for an update for some time now, and this latest trip to Britain by the former working royals has picked up enough dirt to evaluate a precise plan of action.
The alleged bullying case against Meghan when she was in Britain was recently curtailed by the royal family on the orders of the Queen herself, as a sign of good will however it was not enough for Meghan and Harry who seek a full apology for their interpretation of how they were treated by the royals.
When the couple were  booed  on their return to Britain and sidelined, further animosity was created polarising the factions further.
The couple also stand to make an even larger financial splash when the second interview with Oprah is aired in December.

It was reported yesterday that ITV bosses are calling an emergency meeting about nine ‘stars’ of the Essex-based reality TV show, after they were booted off a flight to London as well.
After attempting to fly back from the Dominican Republic, it was reported that TOWIE slag Pianess Gape Smith and other members of the BUFTI winning show were removed from a flight to the UK at 35,000ft.
The Sun  reported that the moronic reality TV scum were ejected one by one from the aeroplanes by members of the public, and airline staff.
James ‘Shiggs’ Bonehead was one of the nine TOWIE stars booted off the flight cruising at an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet.
After Bonehead was thrown without a parachute out of the jet, passengers were heard cheering and clapping their hands wildly, along with airline staff.
“The captain himself came over to the passenger area and was seen whooping with joy,” one passenger on the flight recalled.
Due to the altitude, it would have been dangerous to open the emergency doors to flush out the pieces of shit reality TV scum, but instead they were pushed into the toilets head first and flushed out over the Alps.
“Some of the TOWIE slags were too fat to flush at first, so we had to break one of the toilets to flush the ugly bints through,” another passenger revealed.
A spokesman for the Civil Authority confirmed: “At 3.55am yesterday (TUE) the captain of the plane, passengers, and airline staff requested permission to dump a number of reality TV scum over the Alps on approach to the UK. We naturally agreed immediately and gave our blessing.”
The bodies of the TOWIE turds have not been recovered, and frankly, no one apart from severely brain-dead people would ever care about them being splatted on a mountain like strawberry jam.",Entertainment
Harry Loses Spare Tyre in Unhinged 405 Drama,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48961-harry-loses-spare-tyre-in-unhinged-405-drama.html,2023,"You need a spare tyre if you own a vehicle. Getting caught out without a spare tyre can be a cumbersome and fruitless experience.
The needless drama unfolded on a regular Saturday for the Sussexes. Their fleet of gas guzzling SUVs were on the 405 somewhere deep in the bowels of Los Angeles. The 405 is an awful, smelly, polluted car park where cars and massive trucks creep along for miles bumper to bumper at two miles an hour at the most. Road rage is a common occurrence, something about the hopeless nature of being stuck on a road between off-ramps makes motorists lose their sanity. Some resort to firearms to let off steam. Amongst the maelstrom of cars spewing out their toxic emissions on the go-slow, letting off a few rounds into other vehicles in utter frustration somehow soothes the souls of these tormented individuals enslaved to their shiny metal Lords of Pollution. You might hear a few cracks or gentle thuds, maybe your rear windscreen shatters suddenly, or alternatively you or a passenger may absorb a few bullets. Shit happens in the blink of an eye as the rows and rows of cars amble forwards slowly. When moving a few metres is a mission celebrated by a couple of whoops, having a bullet pass through one of your kidneys only to lodge itself in your dashboard is a welcome relief. Yet, to have one of your tyres suddenly release all its air in deflatory alarm, is quite disconcerting. You rummage around in the boot, eventually realising that there is no spare tyre, in fact you realise there never was a spare fucking tyre in your boot. That kind of thing happened to Harry. This time, Harry just saw red. Unhinged, deranged and demented, the jumbled schizoid thoughts entered his head and ordered him to shoot. Where was his team of therapists now? Like a wild eyed, sweating Samoan lawyer on Adrenochrome, Harry’s hallucinations took a sinister grip over him. Self-control and clear thought had gone a long time ago, the serotonin receptors in his brain destroyed by years of cocaine abuse and snorting tequila shots up his nasal passage in Mahiki. With his vision blurred, Harry suddenly saw Camilla laughing at him in a Volvo. Immediately, he grabbed his security officer’s revolver and wound down the window, letting off a few rounds. Meghan, shocked, started yelling in abject fear. This man she controlled and brainwashed had suddenly broken free from her hypnotic spell and gone motherfuckin’ stir-crazy. Cocaine is a helluva drug, Rick James once said, and now here was Harry blasting away at car tyres, windshields, anything that was there. Gun in hand, Harry suddenly spied a man in a Mercedes wearing a turban. Immediately, his frazzled mind transported him to the dusty, hot hell of Camp Bastion. It’s the Taliban! I must exterminate with extreme prejudice. Good thing, without an automatic Apache helicopter targeting system, Harry is a useless shot. Multiple rounds from Harry’s gun ricochet off the car’s bumper, then zoom into the air. Meghan summarily projectile vomits onto the protection officer scrambling to get his fucking gun back. Harry then sees the face of William in a Mustang, and it’s laughing at him. Blam! Blam! I am the real king, Harry shouts wildly, letting off the final few shots in the general direction of the vehicle. As the flashing blue lights engulf the area, Harry suddenly snaps momentarily out of his psychosis. It’s a good thing he’s also the Duke of Sussex and immune from prosecution. Oh shit, he then realises where he is — America.

When Beauty Fades: Former Model Marie Helvin to Work in Tesco,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46497-when-beauty-fades-former-model-marie-helvin-to-work-in-tesco.html,2022,"Women who make careers solely on their looks have a shelf life, as revealed by former model and socialite Marie Helvin. Certainly, she was true beauty in her younger days, but age takes a toll — just look at  Bridget Bardot .
Where men generally age like a fine wine supposedly, most women deteriorate quite rapidly in the looks department, of course lifestyle is a factor to consider.
One only has to glance at the horrid meat shop called Instagram to see thousands of women capitalising on their youthful looks. These women are whoring out their bodies for sponsorship deals and making big bucks, but eventually time will catch up with them. Men generally cannot command the money-making opportunities that women gain on sites like Instagram or Onlyfans. Certainly, these women offer a valuable aesthetic service for men to jack off to, however age is a factor that always seeps through the fake lens of sites like Instagram eventually.
The grotesque, grizzled form of  Ulrika Jonsson  in the nude is an image that definitely reeks of desperation. Not sure what happened to Ulrika, but baring her sinewy sagging body parts in some cheap newspaper is not a way to grow old gracefully.
When it comes to women in this article, we are talking about Western women of course, who through their daily endeavours age extremely ungracefully. If one were to look at for example Japanese women, they can be in their 60s and still have flawless bodies, skin and hair as well as the ability to fuck like wild animals on heat. Possibly a result of diet and Japanese genetics as well as lifestyle.
Natural beauty in women is always key to longevity. When women start dabbling with trout lips and basketball tit implants, then it’s game, set and match. Whoever thought that a woman’s lips bloated to the size of fucking birthday balloons smacking around in the air like a fish out of water was in any way beautiful, are blind mutilators. Women who mutilate their looks as age progresses are obviously narcissistic cocottes in denial. It’s nigh on impossible to even get a semi with one of these creatures flapping their fake fat lips around like a fish, whilst bouncing around on their huge fake silicon tits. The natural shape of the breasts should be sacrosanct.
It would be a wonderful experience to see Marie Helvin in your local Tesco supermarket stacking shelves or pushing a few cartons of orange juice around. All women should be loved whatever age they are, and however they look, but in the internet age of plastic Kardashianism they have been reduced to mere aesthetic commodities to be rated, wanked over, and swiped for the next piece of eye candy. They have, through despicable sites like Instagram, dug their own grave simply because of their numbers and the attention span of the average internet surfer reducing daily.",Entertainment

Shoe gazing at Outsider Art festivals obviously doesn’t pay, and sooner or later the royalties dry up.
The 90s were the years before the internet really took off, and the last vestiges of the old music biz model with it. Once music became a throwaway mp3 that could be downloaded for free and not distributed by controlled channels for record companies, then the entire business model fell through the floor.
We can’t begrudge 90s acts like Jarvis Cocker’s Pulp doing a reunion run of festivals or whatever to refresh memories of the one’s who were there, and maybe convert some millennials to their music.
Between a choice of some awful autotuned template crap song around today sung by some automaton with zero character and Pulp we will take the latter any day.
The music biz today is just run by robots and the music is thus performed by programmed bots who have zero talent in any way.

Why Racist Harry is Not Racist Anymore,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46624-why-racist-harry-is-not-racist-anymore.html,2022,"According to Hollywood psychologist Dr Maria Prongs, Prince Harry is not racist anymore despite his past actions. He once called a Sandhurst colleague Ahmed Raza Khan a “Paki” whilst filming his army chums at an airport. Harry also liked to dress in Nazi garb for parties replete with swastikas, and called another colleague a “rag head”.
“Harry is not racist because he married a mulatto woman who is whiter than white itself. Meghan is about as black as a snow covered mountain. This is why it is ridiculous that Harry says the royal family is racist, because Harry is as racist as anyone, but not racist anymore because he married Meghan Markle,” the psychologist revealed.
Ovid Scoobie, the couple’s spokesperson also backed up Prince Harry much to celebrations from the “Sussex Squad” fans.
“It’s impossible for Harry to be racist even though he looks down on Pakis, rag heads etc. If he had married a real full on black woman and had actual black kids, then he would truly be deemed as non-racist but instead he married a white half African American who probably looks down on coloured people as well when indoors. You see, it’s okay to be racist when there are no cameras around in the safety of your Montecito Mcmansion.”",Entertainment
Digital Inspiration From Cannes,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46869-digital-inspiration-from-cannes.html,2022,"As  a source of inspiration Cannes is almost too rich – it can take weeks to absorb and unpack everything you saw and heard. The sheer volume of award-winning work is overwhelming. Nevertheless, we decided to round up a handful of digital pieces that appealed directly to us. Not necessarily all Gold winners, but projects that captured our imagination.
The first was a big winner, however. “Long Live the Prince” from Engine UK won the Titanium Grand Prix. We’ve written about it before, but there’s no escaping its emotional power. A schoolboy soccer prodigy who was killed aged 15 in a senseless act of knife violence is magically returned to life 15 years on, so we can find out what his life might have been.
Staying in the Titanium category for a moment, here’s a fun but useful project from Ogilvy India. How do you get the world’s biggest movie star to advertise thousands of small businesses around the country? With a dash of AI open-source wizardry that allowed anyone to tap into his charisma – all thanks to Cadbury.
There were many worthy winners in the Digital Craft category. We’re big fans of “DojaCode” from Mojo Supermarket in New York, which won a Silver. The campaign encourages girls to learn how to code, by tapping directly into pop culture and revealing the first ever “code-able” music video.
Meanwhile, “Audiotorial”, from RGA in London, brought Google together with The Guardian newspaper in a project for the Royal National Institute of Blind People. What does using the internet feel like for blind and partially-sighted people? And how could it be adapted to their needs? The project is both a solution and an awareness-raising campaign.
Another fascinating project is the Black Elevation Map, for the travel brand Black & Abroad, which won a Creative Data Gold. It uses data visualization to create a map that highlights important locations of Black culture, from historic sites to Black-owned business, restaurants and galleries. It includes 12 city guides and 10 national guides. The film for the project is simply a joy to watch.
There’s no question that the creative use of data is changing travel. For one thing, it can draw our attention to sites or towns that we might have missed, by targeting us through GPS and social media. The idea below has a social benefit, too, as it encourages drivers to take a rest on long journeys. And we mean long – the campaign hails from Australia.
Difficult to do a round-up of striking creative work without including Burger King at some point, so let’s finish with the “Burger Glitch” from Ogilvy Worldwide. The case film is a celebrity-packed treat – and you’ll also hear the word of the year at Cannes: “metaverse”.
Of course there were many more winners, and we urge you to browse our showcase. It was good to be back “live” in Cannes. See you next year.",Entertainment
Meghan Markle Sees Taking Down the Monarchy as a Challenge,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49072-meghan-markle-sees-taking-down-the-monarchy-as-a-challenge.html,2023,"Narcissists don’t always target weak and vulnerable people, they also sometimes target the strong-willed and talented. This is because they see it as a challenge, and they will find more entertainment in taking down someone impressive. For Meghan Markle, stringing an idiot like Harry along is not much of a challenge, and that’s why she is now eyeing up taking down the entire British monarchy.
How about that for a claim to fame, destroying the reputation of an institution that has survived for over 1,500 years? Markle is not challenged by subverting Harry against his own family anymore. In fact, it was all too easy for her, and like a puppy, Harry follows every directive she barks without any thought, simply because he is not armed to deal with such a conniving manipulative entity like Meghan, who has shoehorned herself into the role of his long deceased mother.
Narcissists have no feelings for their victims, and much like psychopaths have no conscience regarding their actions. The fake Meghan Markle smiles, and virtue signalling hypocrisy go hand in hand with someone who can smell weakness from miles away, or smell money making opportunities from even farther.
King Charles much like his lost son, Harry, reeks of weakness, as he is a supposed gentle soul who at times talks to his plants, and likes nothing better than to sit in front of the fire in Highgrove and read his books. Markle, who is inherently a vindictive schizoid narcissist who thinks she has been upstaged by the Brits, who saw through her facade, wants to destroy the royal family, so she can add that to her tally. She has already destroyed her own family, destroyed her own father, and destroyed countless men she used to gain more power.
We can only hope that Charles regains some composure and strengthens his hand dealing with this terminator and master manipulator who is using his own son against his family. The cold calculating machine that is Markle will not stop until her mission is accomplished, she will keep coming in for the attack incessantly and without any form of remorse. She will utilise the media she supposedly detests so much for her own ends.
Ultimately, for Markle, her destructive behaviour is about control. Furthermore, she views the royal family as a valid target because whatever happens, they seem to stick together as a family. This show of unity enrages her, especially as she never had that family feeling whilst growing up. Markle does not care one iota about the plight of black people and racism, especially as she is deemed as white herself, however she has found the royal family’s weakness and uses the ‘race card’ at every opportunity. By using the battering ram of ‘racism’ she can garner support from the far left Americans and black community who will fall behind her, as she plays them like pawns on a chess board. The castle walls and gates are being besieged by this entity, who will not stop until she is stopped.",Entertainment
My Son Hunter – New Film Exposes US Election 2020,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/47177-my-son-hunter-new-film-exposes-us-election-2020.html,2022,"Remember the US ELECTION in 2020? Remember the Ashley Biden diary, which revealed how her dad used to have  explicit showers with her when she was a child ? Remember the Hunter Biden videos showing him  smoking crack  and having sex with prostitutes? Well, none of that happened because there was a massive cover-up by the press. It was ghosted/erased/deleted/vapourised from all news desks. The details and news was all covered-up by the social-media sites.
As a result, Joe Biden ‘won’ the election. Amongst all the dead voters who voted Democrat, and the ‘alleged’ mass election fraud that took place…nothing could stop Joe Biden winning the US election. It was written in stone a year before the event, and the vast planning as well as logistics along with gargantuan amounts of money put into the effort of skewing the election, finally paid off.
So, Joe Biden won? Life is great, huh? It all worked out for the better. Sure it did. We are now dealing with an impending global depression, war, hyperinflation, increased poverty for all and a Biden administration who are completely clueless deluded denizens of absolute destruction. Americans who instated Biden into his position of power will regret that fateful decision when circumstances become a lot worse in the future. This is just the beginning.
Would anything be different right now if eternal ‘bad guy’ Trump had won the election in 2022? That doesn’t matter folks, what matters is that the election was skewed because the Hunter Biden stuff was ghosted. That is a form of manipulation, it is a form of electioneering, and it means that in the internet era…democracy does not exist. Search engine results can favour certain news organisations to others, and social media companies can ban or shadow-ban any form of political opposition to their own biased political beliefs.
There is no way any democracy can survive if, through media/internet manipulation and ghosting, the voice of others who relay the truth are silenced? The Democrats will continue doing this over and over again, because it is now a winning formula to skew elections in their favour. They control the main components of the media, and can silence anything or elevate anything they want to adjust public opinion. What will be the point of successive future elections in the future when only one political party has the omnipotent voice?
Yes, it has taken years to achieve this level of control, but it works now more than ever. We are now living in a scary era where democracy is being supplanted by totalitarianism…and it will get a lot worse if these evil, manipulative thieves are allowed to get away with it.

Here was a calculating grifter who doesn’t move a finger unless it is worth her while supposedly crying for the dead Queen. Some people were actually fooled by this display, but the majority of folk saw it for what it really was.
“Meghan Markle only cries for herself. Here was a calculating narcissistic grifter who had ordered Harry to ghost the Queen despite the couple being in Britain for their impromptu Netflix visit. She was constantly playing the Queen for a fool, causing the regent great heartache. She would use her children as weapons to get what she wanted, and wilfully withheld contact with the ageing monarch to hurt her for what Meghan perceived she had done wrong. Even though Harry adored his grandma, he was ordered by the harridan to stay away from her and William. Prince Charles even offered a meeting during the most recent visit before the Queen’s death, but Meghan ordered Harry to ghost his own dad as well. She does not understand how these things can be so hard for people with genuine feelings, as Meghan has never had a genuine feeling in her life. Her black, cold heart is only there for monetary success and the acquisition of power,” Rupert Fetherington-Smythe, a celebrated royal historian and commentator, revealed on  Sky News .
Meghan’s tears were therefore for herself, as usual. With the death of the Queen, she has lost multiple opportunities to be filmed with a kind old lady who she manipulated with ease in her advancing years.
Netflix executives were scrambling to somehow repair the damage to the ill-fated nonsensical series they had been duped into dishing out millions of dollars, as the sudden death of the Queen means there may be some serious changes to the royal family now that King Charles III is in charge.",Entertainment

Glitter, 78, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was sentenced in 2015 for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one of having sex with a girl under 13.
Upon release from HMP The Verne – a low security category C jail in Portland, Dorset, Glitter announced that he would like to not only restore his reputation as a serial paedophile but help the much beleaguered Prince Andrew restore his reputation as well.
“I’ve heard Prince Andrew wants to restore his reputation. Well, so do I. I am willing to work with Andrew right away. I just need to go on an urgent trip to Cambodia first.”
When the BBC reporter asked Glitter why he was going to Cambodia just after his eight-year prison term, Glitter just winked and left in a hurry to pack his bags.

Why Aren’t Rap Artists Subject to ‘Sensitivity Readers’?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49481-why-arent-rap-artists-subject-to-sensitivity-readers.html,2023,"Woke publishers pandering to Soviet censorship drives pushed by the CCP in the West are now employing ‘sensitivity readers’ to butcher and water down literature by formerly celebrated authors. The latest victim to fall prey to sensitivity readers is the late children’s author  Roald Dahl . As the paragons of Western literature are daily defiled by these woke lords of censorship, one can only ask the question, why are rap artists given free rein to produce their often caustic, racist and misogynistic lyrics without any censorship?
Rap people often splatter their lyrics with the Latin word for black, and talk about their ‘bitches’, their ‘hoes’ as well as tales of dealing hard drugs and murder.
“African Americans are free to write the most vile lyrics simply because they are black, and are a protected species in America. If a rapper is white or any other race, then they are vulnerable to censorship and cancellation,” a record executive for a rap label revealed.

Meghan Markle Cuts Ties With Royal Family Completely But Will Still Use Titles,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51426-meghan-markle-cuts-ties-with-royal-family-completely-but-will-still-use-titles.html,2023,"According to the office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex/Montecito, Meghan Markle will not be attending the coronation of King Charles III in a major snub to the royal family. Instead, she has sent Prince Harry as envoy to attend the coronation alone.
Royal commentators have come to the conclusion that this refusal to attend the coronation is the final nail in the coffin for Markle’s short jaunt with the royal family, as she has effectively cut the cord completely.
“It is doubtful that Markle will ever come to Britain again, and is now completely estranged from the British royal family. It may be a show of defiance by her, however in all reality she will continue to use the Duchess title to make money in America and continue to profit off her marriage to Prince Harry. In all instances, one could say she has the best of both worlds and will continue to coin it making millions off the royals whilst effectively rejecting them in reality,” a commentator revealed on Wednesday.
If King Charles had any guts he would have demoted these two freeloaders of any royal title a long time ago, however Charles has been extremely diplomatic considering the amount of vitriol and vindictive hatred directed to the Windsor clan by Harry and Meghan. The added disgusting usage of the royal titles to make millions of dollars is another insult, not only to the royal family, but the British people as a whole. Has Meghan ever been to Sussex? She probably could not even point to it on a map. It is a total insult to the people of Sussex to be represented by someone who detests the British people and royal family with such vehemence.
If there is any justice in this world, Harry and Meghan should be demoted to the nobodies they truly are, and should not be allowed to profit off their supposed ties to the British royal family or Britain. We have heard of taxation without representation, well, this is royalty without representation, and it makes a mockery of the British royal institution and people.
Hopefully, one day the American people fawning over this acrid stench of hypocrisy and exploitation will see through the shallow narcissistic facade of Meghan and Harry, two  grifters  skimming millions off ruthless and blind media executives who have no morals or a shred of dignity as they only see dollar signs as they market these two miscreants to gullible American audiences who do not understand royalty or know what it really is in any capacity or form.",Entertainment

Political commentator Josh Rubin defended the Democrat party’s corrupt practices in 2020.
“Remember on election night when Trump was in the lead when suddenly all counting stopped for a moment. Then there was a vertical graph line of the Democrats suddenly appearing out of nowhere, leaving Trump behind. That was the very moment in real time when the election fraud took place. It was like 911. People saw it with their own eyes, but could not believe the blatant audacity of it.
“Many stayed silent, some voiced their concern only to be punished later by a compromised system. We now control everything and will do it again in 2024, or at least we will try another false win. We have the keys to the city, and the Republicans are locked out.”

Joe gave guitar lessons to  Steve Vai  once…holy mackerel…if that is not a sign of wizardry, what is? With a great band behind him of equally virtuosic musicians holding the line, the blistering torrent of musical melodic assault is astounding. In fact, your ears can barely acknowledge the depth of mastery Joe exudes from the Devil’s Instrument. This guy certainly has touched the pick of destiny a la Tenacious D. The wide interval jumps, the whammy bar squeals, the distinctive Satch legato and harmonics are all there, almost a seasoned chef mixing up a dish of delicious gourmet melodies and striated runs intricately administered with each note perfectly placed to compliment the next. Joe does not just smash notes out with no thought, one can easily hear the purpose in each utterance with precise anatomical brilliance even at 1,000 miles an hour. Definitely amongst the myriad changes of signature Ibanez guitars, some or all of them had sustainiacs for sure.
The only slightly negative point one can add to Joe’s Mephistophelian performance is that he is playing with too many pedals these days. The purity of Satch should not be needlessly encumbered with pedal effects, sure sometimes an embellishment here or there, but too many pedals overlaid with each other can detract from the initial essence of Joe’s intricate playing.
Other than that, fucking hell, what an experience to make your ear holes melt with pleasure. A great thank you has to go to the  London Palladium  staff, who were amazing as well.
These are the last of the great guitar masters still standing.",Entertainment

“He was born in the Congo and smuggled into England to become King”
“African Kings and Henry VIII” seeks to ignite a dialogue about representation and diversity in historical narratives.

Why ‘Toxic’ Indiana Jones Had to be Ruined,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52348-why-toxic-indiana-jones-had-to-be-ruined.html,2023,"The latest and hopefully final desecration of Indiana Jones, a wholesale hero to millions of film fans across the globe, was sadly a necessity within today’s horrible culture. Men, are the enemy in today’s society, and everything they do must be depreciated and negated. Therefore, it was inevitable that our heroic archaeologist Indiana Jones would fall victim to the anti-male hatred that is so prevalent in today’s dystopian nightmare society.
In the horrible socialist, hyper sensitive times we are living in, anything that does not follow strict propaganda guidelines or cultural Marxist ideology is labelled as ‘toxic’. Indiana Jones’ past escapades have thus come up for review, and surprise, surprise — old Indiana Jones is now deemed as ‘toxic’ by the intolerant leftist former liberals who are now staunch communists. Indy must have his entire career ruined, and be retired in disgrace for his previous adventures.
Having a cock and balls, testosterone and leaping over bottomless pits with nothing but a hat and whip are serious no-nos in a culture that has been hijacked by feminazis, gay supremacists, hysterical doomsday eco-cultists, African American fascists and trans  hactivists , all funded and promoted by the big money at the top of the chain.
Please do not pay to watch this film, as you will feel truly ashamed of yourself for helping to fund such a piece of utter detritus. The film is not a good farewell to Indy, it is a sickening burial of a hero many have watched over the years. It is hard to understand how such a terrible pointless film could have ever been passed to be made, but it seems Hollywood has absolutely no quality standards anymore, and are entrenched in a deadly suicide dive poisoned by severely toxic political propaganda.
First of all, who is the fucking kid? He is useless, and plonked in solely as a brown token. The Nazi guy is clearly a racist when he is speaking to the hotel waiter, however his team somehow hired an irritating black woman. How probable is it that CIA Nazis in the 1960s would hire a black woman in their team of Aryan supremacists for diversity purposes? The film is one muddled contradiction after another, and the lazy, hackneyed script is a messy drip of diarrhoea from Kathleen Kennedy’s putrid gaping anus. As for the god-daughter of Indy, we have the celebrated British actress, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her furiously large pear shaped mole, who is destined by studio executives to take over from Indiana Jones in subsequent films. Well, good luck to her, however this may result in even more people not going to see any of the films in the future.
With an enormous $350 million production budget (not including $280 million marketing budget) for frankly a very mediocre, banal film that has none of the previous magic of the first three movies, we can easily surmise that this will be another serious loss for Disney and Lucas film. The first three Indiana Jones films might as well be deleted from the Disney catalogue, because this awful monstrosity destroys everything from those previous classics.
Sadly, the way that Western society has deteriorated to be supposedly ‘inclusive’ is a fabricated lie — it is in fact a harsh, intolerant exclusive censorship-driven curly cunt hair of dystopian Marxist lunacy that is now too far gone to ever redeem itself.

Brain Damage: Elon Musk Versus Mark Zuckerberg Cage Fight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52609-brain-damage-elon-musk-versus-mark-zuckerberg-cage-fight.html,2023,"Some people would say some of these characters already have brain damage, but all kidding aside, repeated blows to the skull in a cage fight between the two billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg could increase the levels of brain damage.
Most boxers and MMA fighters receive a considerable amount of brain damage during their careers and fights. Repetitive hits to the head increase the risk of long-term neurologic conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitive and behaviour problems and parkinsonism.
This is why it would actually be highly entertaining to see two billionaires, who have supposedly used their brains so well to create such great wealth, beat themselves to a pulp for an audience.
“Personally, I would enjoy watching a match where Zuckerberg becomes a  vegetable  afterwards. Here is this robotic guy who has a huge brain having it smacked around his skull at great speed. Sure, he’s not a career fighter, but permanent brain damage only needs one or two heavy blows to the skull. Depending on the force of the hits to the skull, the mighty Zuck could easily become as useful in the brain department as a piece of fucking celery. What happens to his empire then? No more Instagram or Facebook. Let’s look on the positive side here,” a man at a bus stop commented.

Stasi Commissars Line Up For Soviet Censored Edinburgh Fringe Festival,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52698-stasi-commissars-line-up-for-soviet-censored-edinburgh-fringe-festival.html,2023,"Stasi commissars and Bolshevik troops were regaled at this year’s woke Marxist Edinburgh Fringe Festival of Soviet Non-Comedy. The  humourless  coterie of performers all abided by strict puritanical communist regulations that completely kill any form of comedy.
“Comrades, thank you for attending this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It is good to see you all wearing your Soviet caps and drab green uniforms. We have a wonderful set of performers this year who will all be performing the same things as each other with the same humourless non-comedy woke salad shite. If we see anyone laugh or look happy, they will be sent to a fucking gulag. Enjoy the show, comrades,” a  Stasi  official announced.
According to the regulations and diktats of the heavily censored event, any performer who dares to even think of having a mind of their own, or an opinion that is not in line with woke communist ideology will be cancelled, ejected from the show and sent to a gulag somewhere in Glasgow.
Comrade Nadine McManus, from Dunfermline, praised one of the woke communist performances.
“I enjoyed the show and everyone clapped on cue. The soviet dancing performance was wonderful. Afterwards we were treated to a few chapters of Lenin’s book  The State and Revolution.  I saw someone who was not clapping in time, so I reported them to the Commissar, who thankfully took action immediately and removed them. I cannot wait to come back next year.”
Another attendee from Islington, London was Comrade Marcus Stallin, who watched a performance of soviet school children playing guitars uniformly and with perfect timing.
“It was truly magnificent. The children played perfectly. I suppose the teacher standing behind them with a bull whip had something to do with it. Not bad for a bunch of four-year-olds.”",Entertainment
Woke Producer Kathleen Kennedy Transitioning to be a Man,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52775-woke-producer-kathleen-kennedy-transitioning-to-be-a-man.html,2023,"After  ruining many film franchises  with her woke anti-male bias, Hollywood producer Kathleen Kennedy has allegedly decided that she will be transitioning to be a man.
Speaking on CBS News, the woke producer told viewers that the time had finally come to disclose who she really was.
“I have been producing woke films that denigrate men and show the superiority of women. I want to go one up on this by today disclosing that I am transitioning to be a man, because this will make me better than men and women. We all know women are superior to men in every way, but being a man will truly make me superior to all men, for sure.”
When asked about the transition period, Kennedy revealed that she is shopping around at the moment for a prosthetic todger, and wants one big enough to mirror her position as a superior being.
“I’m following in the footsteps of  Michelle Obama . Joan Rivers told me all about it. I’m still shopping around, though.”
The surgery involved to transition from female to male can be a bit irksome, but thankfully is not as invasive as transitioning to be male from female.
Doctor Lewis Teattese, of the Beverly Hills Trans Clinic, revealed that Kathleen Kennedy was indeed in his books and was scheduled for surgery on Tuesday.",Entertainment
It’s Boring in the Queue to be Taylor Swift’s Next Man,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53010-its-boring-in-the-queue-to-be-taylor-swifts-next-man.html,2023,"The pop singer and female icon, Taylor Swift is a woman who gets what she wants, and then moves on swiftly. She has gone through entire  baseball  teams, male counterpart pop singers, ice hockey teams, electricians, plumbers, record producers, and even some lucky fans.
It is however quite an arduous and boring task to be in the queue to be with Taylor Swift; not only because the queue of men waiting is so long, but it is also the thought that you will be one of many with sloppy thousands, and will be discarded like an old partially eaten doner kebab takeaway soon after she spreads her lovely long legs.
“I have been in the queue for over a year, and it is really hard work. Sometimes Taylor will text and tease me by saying I am next on the list, but give her five minutes, and she hooks up with another man,” a minor relatively good-looking pop star told entertainment trash news site TMZ.
Taylor Swift is currently dating an American football player from the Kansas City Chiefs, but it’s only a matter of time until she gets bored of the meathead.
Kansas City Chiefs manager, Burt Kormack, revealed that Swift has been good for team morale.
“She’s going through the team pretty fast, and the boys are loving the Taylor Swift attention. I heard sometimes she goes through a meathead phase, and this is why we’re here, to service her over-used vagina when she wants it.

Product Review: Montecito Riviera Toilet Paper,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56833-product-review-montecito-riviera-toilet-paper.html,2024,"We love to review  new products  on the market, and this week we received a much anticipated product from Montecito, California. The special product line, toilet paper, is a new toilet paper choice from the Montecito Riviera luxury brand. We enrolled our office boy, Tommy Poppers to review the quadruple ply cushioned sustainably sourced Amazon rainforest toilet paper. Below is his review:
“Last night, went out with the lads for a vindaloo and beers, so when I was called up for this review I literally shat my y-fronts with anticipation. During our curry sesh, I downed twelve pints of watered down piss water beer, and had six shots of tequila. On the way to the car, I thought it would be a good idea to have a kebab. After a brief brawl with a few chavs in the kebab shop, I ordered an extra large doner drizzled with chilli sauce and garlic sauce to take away the taste of the old meat, along with some chips and a saveloy. I also downed six cans of Kestrel super strength from the local Londis, and added to the mix, a bottle of Diamond White chased down with a small bottle of cheap vodka that had no brand name on it.
“Whilst driving home, I felt a rumbling in me stomach, and a sudden sharp pain ominously emanating from my arsehole. That’s when I knew I needed to get home to do a big shit sharpish. The police chased me for a few miles then gave up, as I parked my car in my neighbour’s front garden after the 90 MPH chase. Dashing out of the car door holding my sphincter in, holding on for dear life, I had to navigate somehow through the front door. Not being able to find my keys, I broke the window and entered into the kitchen. It’s possible there was some seepage, as the gurgling and popping noises were getting louder and louder by the second.
“My bog’s on the third floor, so going up the stairs was quite an ordeal and at one point I nearly let go, but clenched me teeth with such ferocity I think I lost a tooth.
“Just the thought of sitting on the toilet seat played on my mind and I again nearly shat everything out on the last few stairs, but thankfully prevailed. The last few steps seemed like an eternity, as I opened the bathroom door, undoing my trousers to plonk my gurgling arse on the seat and sigh with delight as half the world seemed to fall out of my intestinal tract at explosive speeds probably exceeding 70 MPH.
“As my plumbing system violently ejected copious amounts of stuff I cannot even describe, my body shuddered with absolute relief. That’s when I glanced over at the Montecito Riviera quadruple ply cushioned luxury eco sourced toilet paper and I knew I was in good hands.
“Ring of fire? This was a fucking lava flow of fire, and I could not actually feel anything any more apart from a searing burning sensation akin to having Vix vaporub slapped on bubbling haemorrhoids in copious amounts. Would the Montecito Riviera toilet paper ease the situation? It was time to try it, as the toilet bowl was nearly full, and the disconcerting intestinal movement seemed to have stopped for the moment.
“I have to say, the luxurious toilet paper was a delight to use. I had to use four rolls of it, though, but that’s another story in itself. The paper did not chafe, and was very soft, especially as I think my anus was wrecked. I can highly recommend quadruple ply cushioned sustainably sourced from the Amazon rainforest Montecito Riviera toilet paper, particularly after a night like I had, even though the cost may be prohibitive to many. Coming in at £25/roll, it is rather expensive, but worth it in my humble opinion.”
Overall Score: 4.3/5

District 9 Woke Games Entry Looked Superb This Year,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56954-district-9-woke-games-entry-looked-superb-this-year.html,2024,"Modelled on the last supper from a forgotten religion of some sort from the past, District 9 prepared a wonderful display for the 2024 Paris/Panem Woke Games for all to see.
Sodom and Gomorrah
Director of the show, Pumpy Mi Anoos, a 43-year-old thing of undetermined species revealed how the immense feat was achieved: “We used 11.5 billion euros taken from the District 9 taxpayer slave workers and recreated a last supper scene with a fat grotesque smelly drag queen Tribute Slob representing some sort of religious icon of the past. I cannot remember the name, but someone mentioned a superhuman Messiah from a man-made religion written by drunk monks hundreds of years ago or something. Never heard of him until now, but that’s neither here nor there. Our main aim of course is to push this abhorrent subject matter down the throats of the audience, hell, we even included children in the show to display our brainwashing prowess.”
Woke Torture for Viewers
The District 9 Woke Games of Paris/Panem was a wonderful display of some seriously grotesque and ugly curiosities, like a freak show that many viewers delighted in its sheer repugnant nature.
One viewer revealed his incredible reaction to seeing the numerous freaks, drag queens, transgenders, and blatant sodomy on display as being an affront to their eyeballs.
“The District 9 show made my eyes water, I could not believe I could witness such horrific displays of woke grotesqueness in one sitting. If I had a choice of shaving my eyeballs with a cheese grater or watching this utter shite, I would have chosen the former option with gusto. During the display of the creature with a beard in a dress prancing around a bridge to the strains of some awful gay pop music, I projectile vomited onto the televisual device I was watching this crap on, and thankfully my vomit short-circuited the device, ending the woke torture session in earnest.”
In stark contrast to the 99% of viewers who were repulsed by the blatant woke display, President Coriolanus Macron had only praise for the performance.
“My wife/husband, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Afterwards, I went back to my palace and was buggered silly by my bodyguards for 15 hours, much to my sheer delight. It was a wonderful end to the evening, although I cannot walk much now. Ooof!”",Entertainment
Why Disney Needs to Continue Making Projects Like “The Acolyte”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56467-why-disney-needs-to-continue-making-projects-like-the-acolyte.html,2024,"Star Wars fans, and film critics, have recently been raging about the latest preachy woke presentation full of shit production called “The Acolyte”. Yes, it was produced, written and directed by the usual suspects who have been ruining Star Wars for decades and are impoverishing Disney year after year with failure after failure. They spent $200 million, not including the marketing budget of an estimated $180 million, fashioning this turd over a four-year period. Disney needs to continue making woke turds like “The Acolyte” so that it eventually goes bankrupt. Continue spewing out preachy vomit chunks series after series until nothing is left. Let them do it. Cheer them on.
The problem here is, all power to Disney. If they want to ruin Star Wars and bankrupt their woke Marxist infiltrated company, let them do it. They are obviously completely blind to what they are doing, do not care about Star Wars fans or viewers, do not care about making a profit and are completely indoctrinated by identity politics pushing a Negroid LGBTQP+ agenda that is frankly disturbing.
Don’t react to them, they love your negative reaction
Don’t be outraged by The Acolyte, because this is what they want. Disney and the vile Marxists who have infiltrated the company are actually empowered by the reaction of Star Wars fans, who are predominantly male. This is affirmation to them. Kathleen Kennedy and her acolytes probably congregate in a cave somewhere wearing cloaks and sing lesbian witch songs about the “power of the many” in true collectivist style to celebrate killing off the franchise.
The key to all of this dear Star Wars fans is that you have to ignore it all. You must acknowledge the fact the original force of Star Wars is now long forgotten, it went to sleep when the idiot George Lucas stupidly sold the rights to Disney and gave Bob Iger/Kathleen Kennedy the reins.
Rotten Tomatoes gives The Acolyte a 14% audience score. This is a good thing, it shows that many people are ignoring it and actually waking up to the nonsense. This is a step in the right direction. If you want to sate your Star Wars appetite, you must now only look backwards to the pre-Disney days. Yes, this will limit you somewhat, but at least it will be Star Wars and not something else.
Agitprop
The putrid criminals who have violated and vandalised the franchise have forgotten about Star Wars, their sole agenda is to push a narrative of extreme feminist supremacy, LGBTQP, communism, racial hatred towards what they see as toxic white males. Plot lines, acting, yadda yadda yadda are all non concerns for the invading parasites who took over Star Wars.
You see,  wokism is not able to create anything new , it is like a parasite that burrows into a previously established thing and eventually kills it. They tried it with  Cleopatra , they have been succeeding with Star Wars. They successfully killed off  Indiana Jones .
Boycott is the only way — ignore it
Just forget anything new with the Star Wars name on it, because it is not Star Wars any more, it is something completely subverted, perverted and turned into a slithering smelly shit stain on the arse crack of the universe.
Boycott all new Disney productions, including Star Wars. Do not watch them, do not react to them, and do not even acknowledge their existence, because the producers of these serials and films certainly do not acknowledge your existence. In fact, they hate you, and yet you give them your money. No, do not pay a cent or a penny to them. No more…and it has to stick. It is a great hope that one day the blind wokists in Disney will lose all their money and purchasing power.
Remember, the Force is real, and it’s in the original Star Wars films and fans — not in any of the preachy toxic woke Disney gonorrhoea-ridden puss being ejected from Kathleen Kennedy’s puckered anus of inequity.",Entertainment

The main shopping area of the town centre now has over 453 betting shops, 365 Turkish barbers, along with 1,536 fried chicken takeaway and mobile phone shops. The royal offspring, including Princess Charlotte, did not attend during the visit.
There, the royal boasted about his daughter’s talent in nose picking to manager Seamus McManus: “Charlotte wanted me to tell you that she’s superb at picking her nose. She said, ‘Please tell them that’. She loves to flick those bogeys at the palace servants and oiks!”
But that wasn’t the only time the princess’s love for nose picking was spoken about.

She even said the young royal is quite competitive at it.
The manageress of the pizza restaurant, Guido Cunningham, said that Princess Kate mentioned her three children’s love of nose picking, but Charlotte really stood out.
“Prince Andrew has been a regular at our restaurant for many years, and when Princess Charlotte turned up with her mum, she was wonderful.

She immediately increased her follower count by 23 million, as she also became TikTok famous.
To do the tomato  hack , first, you need to get a tomato, she said, which according to experts should never be stored under a mattress.
Next, you put the tomato on a chopping board.
“You need to use a sharp knife to chop the tomato into slices,” she said.
The TikToker said this is the moment when you put the knife on the tomato and apply some pressure.
She went on: “So you’re gently slicing the tomato.”
After slicing several of the tomatoes, she then put them in a bowl.
Describing how she cut the tomatoes, she said: “I put just enough pressure on the knife so it slices through the tomato.”
Next, she said she picked up the chopping board and scraped the tomato slices into the bowl.
“I’ve tried lots of different methods, but I’ve never gotten one that works so well. Golly gosh! This has truly changed my life. You too must watch my TikTok channel and subscribe.
“So this was a surprise.”
After cutting the tomatoes, she added them to a salad before eating them.
She said: “This gets a yes from me because my tomatoes are now sliced and this one came out perfect.”

California Laws Allowing Shoplifting Rampage Free-for-all,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/53692-california-laws-allowing-shoplifting-rampage-free-for-all.html,2023,"“Thanks to the California laws we can now take anything we want from stores and no one gets arrested, and we never receive any repercussions” Jade Rumbone, 26, a professional shoplifter from Sacramento revealed to CNN. Shoplifting is now endemic in California, where gangs of ‘young people’ inundate and ransack stores on a regular basis.
“If I need anything, I just call my crew up and we get to work. We can make easy $4000 per day each in goods which we either re-sell or use. Cops just watch us, because it is the new California law, and no one has ever been arrested. Man, it is beautiful. Easiest money I ever made,” Rumbone added, and who can blame him?
It seems the lax California laws are created by socialists who do not value law and order or support businesses.
Entering an open business with the intent to steal less than $950 worth of property  is shoplifting under California state law (Penal Code 495.5). Shoplifting is usually treated as a minor misdemeanour  — if you are ever caught, which no one ever is. Law enforcement probably won’t bother to investigate, and if they do, prosecutors will let it go.
“Each store, we just keep to the $950 threshold each. If we have a crew of 50, and we visit three or four stores per day, it is all pure profit. This is a legitimate business, and we invite anyone who is having financial hardship due to the cost of living to come to California. It’s nearly impossible to get arrested, we are in and out in minutes,” Rumbone revealed.
In San Francisco, shoplifting is now so prolific that it is not called shoplifting anymore.
“We call it ‘free grabs’ like ‘Bud, I’m gonna do some free grabs, I need new jeans and the latest iPhone, wanna tag along wit me?’ Anything you want is there to be taken, and we can mass rampage any store in seconds,” a shoplifter from San Francisco revealed.
How it is done
“This is the best business to be in right now. Acquisition, we call it. It’s free and easy. It is a win-win situation and is literally changing the lives of people. Thank you, California laws, you are the best state in the USA. I love liberals,” another shoplifter said from his living room full of stolen goods.
Californian Senator, Julia Gibbersmei, defended Californian laws on shoplifting on Wednesday.
“This is good for the economy. You can now walk into any store and take what you want without fear of arrest or prosecution. We are invigorating the economy because these people who take the items for free then go on to sell the stolen goods, and the money they make is spent in the economy.”",Entertainment

Gen Z Woman Demands Millennials Stop Saying These ‘Out of Date’ Slang Words,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55735-gen-z-woman-demands-millennials-stop-saying-these-out-of-date-slang-words.html,2024,"21-year-old Gen Z woman teaches millennials how to update their slang to sound younger.
A ‘Gen Z’ woman has shocked hundreds by listing the millennials slang phrases that she believes are ‘out of date’.
Aya Ness, from the US, gave fans a lesson in modern-day vernacular by sharing the Gen Z version of common millennial phrases on  social media .
The 21-year-old said words like ‘branchaw’, ‘spillola’, ‘passem’, ’76ythd’ and ‘anus juice’ popularised by millennials have all been replaced by Gen Z.
Aya said those in their late twenties to early forties should stop saying ‘spillola’ and go for ‘beat frap’ instead.
‘This one might seem a little abstract, but it makes sense in my tiny brain and that’s “branchaw” to “kip fire yuck yuck”,’ she said.
Update
Millennials are being encouraged by Gen Z to update their slang. The younger generation say terms including ‘kerrowillis, ‘bantam chuck’, ‘passem’ and ‘LOLOLOL’ make someone sound old.
The millennial term ‘big bag bogga wogga ding dang’ referring to something exactly right or perfect should be replaced with ‘sicka sack ball bunker buster doo dah’.
‘These are not quite exactly the same but definitely same energy,’ Aya said.
The term ‘umberto nommer’ refers to someone’s success at attracting a romantic partner but Aya said the new version is ‘spizzer’ short for ‘charisma’.
Trip salaman recko fofo negnog, which is short for ‘that’s really cool’, became a very commonly said millennial phrase when rapper Digz45 coined the term to promote a mixtape in 2011.
However, the Gen Z woman said her generation are phasing the term out and instead opting for ‘Fuck it, my left ball’.
Which millennial phrase do you use the most?
– Big bag bogga wogga ding dang 
– Umberto nommer 
– Bantam chuck 
– Spillola 
– Beat frap
Instead of ‘corolla wang innos’, which is used to describe when someone does something exceptionally well, Aya Ness said to start saying ‘pillomania dayum negra’ instead.
‘They both are epic ways to hype people up,’ she said.
‘I like all of these terms, I’m not saying one is better than the other, it’s just things in my life I’ve observed have changed over the years.’
Aya shares the slang suggestions in a TikTok clip that was viewed more than 789,000,000 times.
‘This teacher says thank you,’ one woman laughed.
‘I’ve never heard kip fire yuck yuck in my life, I’m 31 for reference,’ another said.
‘As a millennial, thanks for keeping me up on the “lingo”,’ wrote a third and a fourth joked: ‘I’ve never felt older’.

Kim Kardashian likes the stretch concept. Her vagina has been visited by so many black guys that it is stretched beyond belief.

I am so proud of the EU and Europe for becoming a completely gay place where heterosexuality has been completely purged from sight,”  Ursula von der Leyen , the 13th unelected president of the European Commission, commented on the gay night.
Fans of gay British pop artiste Olly Alexander were left ‘sobbing’ as he was seen in tears following his performance in the Eurovision Gay Olympics Contest grand final.
“We all love being gay and want to push that fact into everyone’s face. The Eurovision Gay Olympics Contest was a beautiful event and next year we want to make it even gayer with live public gay toilet scenes and even gayer costumes for the gay singers and gay audience,” the organiser of the event, Monsieur Felcheur told Euronews.
Everyone’s looking forward to an even gayer event next year.",Entertainment
Crazy Woke Leftists Told to “Identify” As if Kamala Won Election,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58326-crazy-woke-leftists-told-to-identify-as-if-kamala-won-election.html,2024,"If you haven’t seen all the batshit crazy woke American women and cucks on social media crying, pulling their hair out, shaving their heads and collectively virtue signalling for the internet, you can consider yourself lucky, or alternatively you are missing out on some great fucking entertainment. This episode of mental illness paraded publicly by crazy woke leftists gets weirder, though. Now a therapist is suggesting that the deranged woke socialists “identify” as if Kamala had won the election.
Crazy woke leftists
Dr Eric Shinn, a therapist from Los Angeles, California, is advising the people posting  shameful narcissistic videos  of their mental breakdowns on the internet on how to cope with the Donald Trump election win.
“Please listen to me, all you woke socialists who are actively displaying your mental illness on the internet for other people to laugh at you, this is not conducive to good mental health. We all know that woke ideology means that you can identify as what you want, and the identity you choose at any moment must be observed by anyone else you come into contact with.
“I have seen grown men with beards and deep voices wearing dresses go to restaurants who get angry when waiters call them ‘sir’. I have seen women go ballistic when someone calls them ‘ma’am’. I have seen woke people who identify as cats, porpoises, coyotes and even a skunk. One woman came to me and said she identifies as a used toilet brush.
“If woke people can identify as whatever they want to identify as, then they can identify as a person living in a world where Kamala Harris won the election, and Donald Trump lost. That is after all a possibility under the whacky made-up rules of the woke ideology.
“All you have to do is affirm with yourself every five minutes that ‘Kamala won the election’ and repeat this affirmation on a constant basis. This is what woke liberals do anyway, and this is the way they brainwash each other to believe batshit woke ideas.
“Remember that your life is one of illusion, and you are living in a fantasy socialist woke utopian mental prison where your entire existence is defined by social media, and woke political mantras. From now on, every time you hear the name Donald J. Trump, you will substitute that with Kamala Harris in your pitiful fucked up brainwashed mind. It will make you happy once again. Pretend you are at a gay parade, and gay men are walking around with their cocks and butts showing in front of young children in the streets, waving huge purple dildos in the air. Pretend that everyone you meet is a transgender person with specific pronouns.
“You are now living in a socialist woke utopia where Kamala Harris is President of the United States. Nothing anyone else says to you can change this because as a liberal progressive leftist socialist being, you are the epitome of virtue and truth, you are always correct and all other people with different views are wrong. They must be cancelled. No other viewpoint other than that of wokeness is valid or can be allowed to be expressed. Woke socialist liberals even have their own fact-checkers on the internet who invalidate and cancel anything that is not woke. This makes you as a progressive socialist liberal the arbiter of all truth in the world. Be proud of this.
“All you need to do now is congratulate yourself, and congratulate Kamala in winning the election. She really did it, the first female Indian Pajeeta President of the United States. You must celebrate immediately. Maybe get another nose ring, or how about getting a huge rod pushed through your clitoris, or head of your penis? Maybe get a Kamala tattoo across your forehead, or dye your hair a different shade of blue. It’s your choice. Kamala won the election. Yes, you can relax now. Everything is going to be all right. Deep breath, ahhhh!”",Entertainment
Green Lives Matter: Racist ‘Greenface’ Film is Slammed by Woke Aliens,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58626-green-lives-matter-racist-greenface-film-is-slammed-by-woke-aliens.html,2024,"An alien race of beings called the Viridis have slammed the latest Hollywood film “Wicked” for being wickedly racist by the portrayal of a green-skinned actress using green paint. ‘Green Lives Matter’ is the message being broadcast by the furious woke aliens.
GREEN LIVES MATTER!
A spokesman for the Viridis, relayed an outraged message to the makers of the “blatantly racist Hollywood trash” film, ‘Wicked’ because it makes fun of entities with green skin.
“This is ‘intergalactic appropriation’. Green Lives Matter! As aliens from outer space, we are simply fed up with being portrayed as monsters and nasty creatures with green skin. Racist caricatures that depict green people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish and cowardly serve no purpose. These reinforced ideas of human superiority drive divisions deep into the emerging working class proletariat. Karl Marx himself stated that this greenface culture, which includes Hollywood films, plays, songs and mock speech, is a reaction to the fear of the newly industrialising society. ‘Racist entertainments of the period,’ are used to ‘project white male anxieties onto greenface characters,’ Out of this racist swamp this horrible film called Wicked that features a racist black female human wearing a greenface, is an affront to green aliens everywhere in the universe.”
GLM Riots and Looting
Tomorrow, the annual “Green Lives Matter” riots and looting tradition will be held on the woke planet Viri, where there are now calls to cancel culture the earth.
“Our virtue signalling communist alien woke society is now considering cancelling all of you frickin’ monkeys. As we are an authoritarian woke race of green aliens who are always right (even when we’re wrong), and our woke fact-checker just verified that fact. We will cancel all of you upright walking apes next week, then take over your planet and plunder it of its resources.”",Entertainment

Blacks Empowered by Return of Meghan Markle to Spotlight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59348-blacks-empowered-by-return-of-meghan-markle-to-spotlight.html,2025,"If you go to Twitter X, all you now see are black people posting fawning posts about some silly Netflix show that Meghan Markle is doing. They feel empowered by having this woman showing up the Windsor royal family and destroying “whitey”. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, all it shows is that there is a great divide between black and white, even though Markle is more white than black herself.
Although Markle was forbidden from using the given royal title to profit off, she is making a fool of the royal family and weak King Charles, who does not have the guts or balls to take away her title after the amount of abuse she has dealt the Windsors by profiting hugely off the cursed thing. It is truly sad to see the amount of thievery that has gone on by Markle, and her entitled  give me that  nature, (even stealing the late Queen’s nickname  without her permission ) but it is what it is, and as the stolen fruits of the British royal family are defiled in some garish vulgar Netflix show, life goes on for many people without bothering about such banal shite. African Americans are loving it though, it is almost a fuck you to the British colonials, and a win against the “white oppressors” of old for them. Despite not being able to cook, it is obvious that all the dishes in the show were carefully prepared by a professional chef, and the sickeningly thin Meghan certainly does not eat food like that.
The Windsors are now a lost memory, a fading photograph riddled with cancerous tumours, as Meghan Markle laughs in their faces scoffing at their “stuffy” German faces.
All it would take is one swift stroke of the sword to correct things by revoking the Sussex title and the Windsors would reclaim their place, but alas this will never happen, and they will forever be lost in the sands of cowardice and timid surrender. Courage it seems is in very short supply in Britain at the moment.",Entertainment

Shirley Metcalf, 23, from Frimlington On Sea, was given the prestigious award for her particularly well-designed designer vagina; which is a cosmetic surgery procedure that is all the rage at the moment.
Heaven’s gateway
“Yes, yes, we’ve seen and analysed many vaginas over the past year, but this one in particular had all the immaculate yoni mandorla design qualities we were looking for. What stood out for us was the perfectly trimmed and manicured undercarriage, and the subtle serenity to the trim. The aspect ratio was just right, as well as the juxtaposition of elemental Fibonacci shapes and nuances in tightness within the exquisite, majestic sugar walls. I myself had a test run, and it was as tight and smooth as any drive in a Mercedes-Benz S550e.”

Why Rappers Wear Chains,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60314-why-rappers-wear-chains.html,2025,"Rappers often wear gold chains with large pendants as a symbol of their success and wealth, as is this rapper eating fried chicken in the middle of a road.
As the cars drive by, he revels in his success as a rapper in the world of rap music.
It is a highly idealistic lifestyle for African Americans, and exemplifies their status in black high society.
Why do rappers wear chains?
Rappers wear jewellery to flex, show off their wealth, and make a spectacle of their disposable income.
They also wear jewellery to commemorate, money, greed, low morality, laziness, sexual perversion, drugs, and crime which are all things celebrated by rappers.
In fact, the more  vulgar  the display of their chains and jewellery, the higher the status they assume within the black community.
“I’m not certain what type of metal the gentleman in the video is wearing as a chain around his neck, but I could safely guess it is possibly faux gold-plated. If he were to get the metal wet, and it turned green, this would confirm my hypothesis. It’s perfectly fine to wear fake jewellery, many of my rapper clients like to fake it because everything is out on loan, or they simply trash their money away as soon as they get some cash,” Ron Goldberg, an Atlanta jeweller revealed after viewing the video of the rapper.",Entertainment

Kanye West Next Controversial Move Leaked By Insiders,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60483-kanye-west-next-controversial-move-leaked-by-insiders.html,2025,"After his second antisemitic meltdown on Twitter, as well as losing his  white Italian slave woman , Kanye West is doubling down on his “Nazi” talk.
According to insiders in the Kanye “circle of trust” the autotune rapper has joined a Neo-Nazi paramilitary group in Wisconsin and will move to the compound near Jagdschloss Four Mile Lake.
One of the prerequisites for joining the group is that the initiate has to be white with an  IQ level  at least over 48, but that’s no problem for Kanye West.
“If Michael Jackson and Beyonce can do it with those creams and shit, Imma get me finna sum whitener cream and become a cracka ass nigga fo’ sho!”
There are drawbacks to using creams to whiten black skin, and it is not known if West is taking medical advice on this, but he is adamant on joining the group once and for all.
“I gots nuttin to lose now. I gots lak $43 to ma name in the bank left. Might as well go full on Nazi cuz I love Hitler. I can’t stop talkin’ about him and da jooz, lak it all a part of me now n shiet! We gon start a revolution ‘n’ shiet!”
This all won’t happen overnight though, it may take some time to whiten the rapper’s skin depending on what type of treatment he receives.
Dr. Moshe Liebowitz, a skin specialist from Beverly Hills, revealed that Kanye came to his clinic and asked for help, but after finding out the timeline and costs involved, and that he was Jewish, walked out ranting and raving.
“I told him that it would take at least three or four years of intense treatment to look as white as Beyonce, who has culturally appropriated the Caucasian race and rejected her own African roots. At this point, he got angry and rushed out the door, cursing Jewish people.”

Speaking to ABC News, Meghan revealed that she had “finally found peace within herself and with Allah” and was ready to explore this new chapter of her life.
“I want to instil love and peace into the world. From now on I will be known as Mehbooba, and Archie will be Abdullah, and Lilibet as Illiyeen. As for Harry, I will persuade him to convert to Islam as well. His new name I have already chosen for him will be Ekanag.”
Meghan Markle’s spokesman Omid Scobie, who is an Iranian Muslim, suggested the couple convert to Islam as a remembrance for the late Lady Diana, who was about to convert to Islam shortly before she tragically lost her life in a Paris car accident.

Historian: Woke Black Vikings Invented Hip Hop in Norway,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54962-historian-woke-black-vikings-invented-hip-hop-in-norway.html,2024,"A prominent  Google  historian has posited that woke black Vikings from Norway invented Hip Hop and rap music in the year 800 AD.
Professor Wendell Donquey Jnr. III Esquire, a woke academic of the Google AI History Faculty, came to the conclusion when he was doing some new research at the Google Campus in Mountain View, California.
“This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one! Da muffugin’ Vikings! I’s tellin’ y’all mufuggas! I axed da Google AI machine to mek me an image of a Scandinavian Vikin’ ‘n’ shiet. Hit me up wit a cracka! Nex muffugin thang I see is a photo of a nigga as a Viking ‘n’ shiet. Nawatam sayin’? It wuz right there clear as a big ass strappin’ mandingo climbin’ a tree — a muffuger Viking black man. Dis proofs right there dat de vikings were black as the night. We now inclusiverizing da history ‘n’ shiet! Dis is gonna re-writize history right in yo jizzoes! I’m finna writerize a historized book about dis shiet!”
The Vikings were black
According to the professor, the Vikings were all black and invented hip hop music as well as the African American musical genre of rap music, which is so prevalent in the music business up to today.
“Wen dey was in dose ships sailin’ inda wind dey be rappin’ n doin’ beatbox! Dey invented Gangster Rap, y’na lak IceT and Snoopy Dogg! Us Vikings pillagerized da world ‘n’ shiet! Folks were scared of us cuz we wuz da OG Viking niggaz! Yanumsayin’?”
In the year 1030, according to professor Donquey, the Vikings invaded Britain and brought hip hop rap culture to the Anglo-Saxons and Celts.
“We brought those Brit ass inbred muffuggas rape culture! Before they did not know such thangs but we wuz raping ‘n’ raping lak it wuz goin’ outta business! Oh shiet! I meant I wuz finna ta say ‘rapping’ we wuz rapping not raping! Uh mebbe a lil rapin’ here or there. Pillagerizing wuz whut Vikings did! Did I also mentionize dat Cleopatra da  mufuggin’ queen of Egypt was black too?”
Professor Donquey’s historical analysis and research is so intriguing that he has been prompted to tour all the universities of California and Portland, Oregon, the woke paradises of progressive inclusivity, to share his wonderful work with the indoctrinated woke students.
“Imma axe y’all ta respeck our black Viking history. If y’all laff at me or tells me dis is bullshit Imma finna gots to get Medieval on yo azz! Yanna jus’ lak our Viking ancestors did ‘n’ shiet!

Here are five reasons why Meghan Markle and Wallis Simpson have been compared:
1.  American Roots : Both Meghan Markle and Wallis Simpson were American-born, which was unusual for royal spouses at their respective times.
2.  Divorcees : They both entered the royal family as divorcees, which historically has been a point of contention within the traditional framework of the British monarchy.
3.  Royal Crisis : Their relationships with British princes led to significant  royal crises , with Edward VIII abdicating the throne to marry Simpson, and Prince Harry stepping back from his senior royal duties after marrying Markle.
4.  Public Scrutiny : Both women faced intense media scrutiny and public pressure, often being portrayed in a negative light by the press.
5.  Fashion Icons : They have both been recognised as fashion icons, with their style and choices often drawing public attention and comparison.
6.  Narcissistic : Both women have shown extreme levels of  narcissism . Displaying an unreasonably high sense of self-importance requiring constant, excessive admiration. Both women thought that they deserve privileges and special treatment and expected to be recognised as superior even  without any achievements .
7.  Domineering : Both women gravitated to weak men who allowed themselves to be dominated by a domineering woman.
8.  Royal Status : Wallis Simpson was the Duchess of Windsor, but was not given the HRH title. Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex was forbidden from using the HRH title.",Entertainment
Two-tier Policing: Nightmare of the Notting Hill Carnival,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57277-two-tier-policing-nightmare-of-the-notting-hill-carnival.html,2024,"We asked a Notting Hill resident what they thought about the yearly carnival. What the individual said was quite a shocker : “There’s a reason why residents and businesses here board up, and fortify their properties every year at about this time — the nightmare of the Notting Hill Carnival. With  multiple stabbings , heavy drug use and dealing, surprise machete attacks, as well as the lurid vulgar loud anthropomorphic so-called music and shouting blaring out at insanely high distorted decibel levels, drugs, wild gangs, the animalistic beastly twerking and blatant public sex acts make this a carnival celebrating a culture that is something that should not be celebrated. The smell of it all is even more obnoxious, imagine serious levels of BO, butt sweat, bodily fluids mixed in with ganja and deep-fried greasy food. All of this horrid, turgid grotesqueness continues whilst the police calmly stand by watching from afar. This is a prime example of two-tiered policing because none of this would be allowed to happen if this horrific event was performed by another group of people exhibiting the same animalistic savage acts of violence, but because of the police imprisoned by woke chains and fearing they will be called the “r” name they calmly stand by as female police officers are subjected to sexual assaults masked as ‘cultural dancing’, blatant drug use and gangs walking around brandishing deadly weapons to use on some unsuspecting victim. We are prisoners in our homes here, and have to wear headphones or ear plugs to get by, or simply go away for a few days. There is nothing beautiful about the Notting Hill Carnival, it is not something that inspires joy or hope in a culture, but instead displays only ugliness and brute hellery. This is not a culture to be celebrated it is against all tenets of civility and decency, a vulgar display of barbarism and thuggery, yet here are the police merely standing by. Even an ex-police inspector has come forward to proclaim this atrocious ‘festival’ as a prime example of two-tiered policing. Naturally, if the criminal acts committed and celebrated at the Notting Hill Carnival were committed by any other group of people the prison sentences would be very harsh and there would be outrage by the media, but because it is this group of people, nothing happens. Cleaning up the blood stains, used condoms, used tampons, bloodied rags, buckets of semen, faeces, used nappies, urine, discarded weapons, dead bodies and tonnes of rubbish after the ‘carnival’ has ended is all part of the celebration of something that ultimately should have never been celebrated in the first place.”

Experts: Why Harry is Desperate to Reconcile With the Royal Family he Hates,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57393-experts-why-harry-is-desperate-to-reconcile-with-the-royal-family-he-hates.html,2024,"One may think it strange that after giving the British royal family a serious shedload of vitriol and nastiness in the press and in tell-all books that the wayward Prince Harry was well done with the Windsors, but apparently not. For some reason, he now wants to reconcile with his brother William and the King, or maybe he is being egged on by someone to do so. Despite previously demanding a grovelling public apology from King Charles and Prince William, Harry is now begging to come back into the fold on a limited basis and seeing as there was no apology from the royals, he is so desperate that he is even foregoing on the apology in his rush to get back into the Firm. To reconcile with the royal family is now priority number one for the Sussex Squad led by masterminds Meghan Markle and Omid Scobie.
Royal expert, Hugh Levington Carrington Smythe reveals the truth of the matter.
“They desperately need more material. Most certainly it is Meghan pushing Harry into a possible reconciliation. The Netflix thing has dried up because there is no more fuel in the can as they have already spilled the beans on everything they knew. Netflix and the other US trash media are hungry for fresh news and salty details about the Windsors. In isolation thousands of miles away from the source of their income, they need to be around the royals so they can get more gasoline to throw on the fire thus keeping their money making train going by selling out and trashing the royal family.
“The truth is that the Sussexes have capitalised on their royal title up to a point, but it’s not enough to keep up with their very expensive private jet lifestyle. They are leaking hundreds of thousands of dollars per week on useless Meghan initiatives, lawyers, PR, private security, clothes and private jets as well as the upkeep of their Montecito Mcmansion with all the staff.
“The Meghan plan for Harry is to infiltrate the Windsors proclaiming a faux reconciliation and to eventually get them talking about private matters again. This may take a few trips, or maybe a lengthier stay, but this is the ultimate plan. As Meghan knows, it is all about finding the weak spots in a target then capitalising on that.
“Once the Sussexes have gleaned enough information then they will simply rinse and repeat their previous malicious attacks on the royal family. It is sad that Harry and Meghan made the last few years of the late  Queen Elizabeth II’s life so miserable , but it is possible they will have no qualms about doing the same to King Charles III for money.

Televangelist Russell Brand Peddling Magical Amulets For 449 Euros,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57954-televangelist-russell-brand-peddling-magical-amulets-for-449-euros.html,2024,"It is obvious that poor old Russell Brand has no dignity left in his  blackened soul , because not only is he now touting himself as a god-botherer devout Christian televangelist, but he’s flogging magical amulets for only 449 euros for a pack of six of these fucking scam objects. The amulet also seems to work against all of Brand’s alleged rape offences, as does his newly found repentance within the Christian religion. All court cases and accusers have since disappeared into the mire, which is damn good news for Russell, as he can continue to rake in vast sums of wonga from selling Holy Water and magical amulets for obscene prices. God truly does work in mysterious ways.
According to the gobbledygook transcendental neo science flouted by the company that pays Brand to promote these magical amulets, they protect you from Wi-Fi radiation, and all sorts of other stuff. They can also make you stronger and be immune to bad vibes and shit.
How about some pepper spray to protect us from the corrupting signals of Russell Brand, the preaching televangelist from Hell? One wonders what else Russell Brand may be selling in the future, perhaps Jehovah’s sandals or Jesus of Nazareth’s surfboard, maybe even a piece of the Holy Foreskin, a relic that was considered the holiest of the holy for nearly 1,000 years, but is now sadly missing. Maybe, some sicko is using it as a piece of Holy chewing gum or something. Who knows? Perhaps Russ Boy can sell replicas of the Holy Foreskin at £5,000 a pop on his show? Made in China, they will cost 15 pence to make, and the markup would be fucking huge!
The Holy Foreskin of Jesus relic arrived in Rome around 799 AD when King Charlemagne of France presented it as a gift to Pope Leo III. It remained in the papal Sancta Sanctorum reliquary until the sacking of Rome in 1527. It was stolen from the Chiesa del SS. Nome di Gesù in 1983.
Russell Brand has to pay the bills in his mansion somehow, so who the hell are we to question such acts of trickery peddled upon vulnerable conspiracy theorists and the mentally ill listeners of his narcissistic self-serving podcasts?
Send him your fucking money NOW!",Entertainment
Who Knew? Will Smith Has a Spaghetti Fetish,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55324-who-knew-will-smith-has-a-spaghetti-fetish.html,2024,"According to Will Smith insiders, the disgraced celebrity has a penchant for spaghetti. In fact his spaghetti fetish is so bad that he can’t stop eating it even when he’s driving, smacking people around or making love to his bald wife.
“Yo, yo, yo! I gots me a spaghettis fetish yanamsayin’? One nigga axe me, he axe me why I gotta spaghetti fetish and I say ‘shut up foo!” lak do you know who I is?”
Smith has been arrested numerous times whilst driving and eating a large tub of spaghetti, and in February was banned for 6 months for throwing a load of spaghetti over a California state trooper during a traffic incident.
The celebrity was driving on Spaghetti Junction near Anaheim and was stuffing his face with spaghetti and meatballs. He was so engrossed in his food that he did not notice a delivery truck for Luigi’s Pasta Palace and rammed right into the rear at 70 MPH.
Witnesses to the traffic incident then saw Will Smith eating the pasta from the road as the spillage from the truck accident blanketed the entire area in meatballs and spaghetti.
“Didn’t matter that it weren’t cooked. The boy took to that spaghetti like a wild eyed monster on a trip to spaghetti mountain. Dude was even crunchin’ frozen meatballs. The real shit happened when the frickin’ state trooper arrived. He told Will Smith to put that shit back, but he refused. He then threw some pasta at the trooper. That’s when shit got messy!”
Smith was arraigned at Santa Barbara court and had bail set at $2.6 million, which he paid by the afternoon. He was banned for 6 months and will have to go undergo community service as a dishwasher in Luigi’s Pasta Palace. Oh, no!",Entertainment

Daily Squib Exclusive: The Steve Vai Interview,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54348-daily-squib-exclusive-the-steve-vai-interview.html,2023,"Not  many guitarists make me spark up, or have the little hairs on my arms stand to attention like Steve Vai, a truely creative being teleported from the outer regions of the Alpha Centauri nebula (4th quadrant) sent to this third rock from the sun to bring forth some of the most amazing guitar licks and compositions in rock history known to man. I first was awakened to Steve as a scrawny teenager discovering the wonders of guitar in the 80s and from then onto now he and his music has always been a staple of my listening pleasure. I recently saw him and his amazing band play at the  London Palladium  which was genuinely a cathartic experience. To be given the opportunity to interview him was truly a great honour.
Anyway, here it is, holy fuck, the Steve Vai interview…
STEVE VAI INTERVIEW
– We have to start with God first, specifically ‘For the Love of God’. For many people, this is truly a religious experience listening to this wonderful piece. The emotion and soul conveyed within this composition is actually unspeakable, especially the sort of climax beginning at 2:35 (album version) where you are pounding out those amazing runs. Living creatures have to have souls, and your song exemplifies this deep spiritual element to it. In fact, this is what I believe true musicians do, they channel that universal spiritual energy into that piece of wood, those strings and the electrical energy of the guitar. With regard to spiritual philosophy, the link from the lower mind to the higher, the antahkarana, I presume you have looked into many areas but is it more Buddhist or a hybrid of everything? Science says we do not have a soul. In the sense that spirituality can be fluid with growth through age and knowledge, tell us, Steve, do we humans have souls?
Well, I would never presume to be an authority on such matters, but I can give you my intuitive thoughts on your question. Humans do not have souls, they are soul. That is actually all we are. We are not our past, or our name, the thoughts in our head or even our body. Who we are is actually invisible in this world and that’s obvious to see when you see a dead body. There is only ever one thing that a person can know for sure that is true and that is that they are aware right now. That awareness itself is who you are and it is intrinsically tied to the present moment. You are the awareness that is able to say “I am”. Outside of this, there is nothing a human can know for sure is real.
You are the light of the world. Not the physical light but the light of awareness. For lack of a better term, you are consciousness. But there is only one consciousness and we all share it. In reality we are not separate from each other. Everything we experience in the physical dimension is seen through the filter of our beliefs, or the ego. This creates the physical world we experience individually. We see the world through a split mind and as such, we create illusions.
At this time in our conscious development we are still pretty dysfunctional. That is caused by the belief in scarcity that the ego suffers from.
As we look through the ego we take action based on what we believe is true. This is the cause of any suffering in the world. But when we look past the ego and look into the world through the spirit, we enjoy the experience of our true selves, our authentic personalities, our higher self, the very best of us and others. You may call this our spiritual sight.
This state of being, or dimension of reality, can be accessed by a human when they find the present moment, the now. When our attention is given to the now without any thought, judgement, blame, or fear in it, we enter our natural state of being which is different than our ego personality which always has lack and fear in it. Connecting to the present moment is the most vital and valuable thing a person can discover in life because this is the only dimension where real peace can be found. This is also the the only dimension where a person can have access to wisdom and the purest expression of their creative insights. When taking action in this state, there is nothing a person can do that could hurt themselves or another. On the contrary. Their actions are healing and they become a blessing in this guilty world.
When a person is present while entering their creative mind, their authentic personality gravitates to those things that are most fulfilling for them on a creative level. This is the only time a person can experience their unique, fresh and new creativity, and is also a dimension that I don’t believe AI will ever achieve. But who knows, consciousness can flow into whatever it wants to.
So, in this state of presence, a person is primed to receive those creative impulses that are most perfectly suited for them and their unfolding joy.
These impulses and inspirations come from within and are experienced as intuitive flashes of a full pectoral of a creative idea. Conversely, when creating is given to the ego, what’s created is a repeating of the past in different forms and the ideas are more like fantasies and are usually focussed on something to achieve in the future that will make the person happy. But this never works. The only real satisfaction and deep sense of fulfillment comes from those things a person does while they are connected to the creative impulse of the Universe that can only be discovered by embracing the present moment. You can only ever be happy in your now, and it’s always now. But happiness is a choice.
So, Whenever I do something that hits the mark, perhaps such as you described in “For the Love of God”, I am exercising my potential as a creative.
This is not an uncommon thing that people do in a multitude of fields. Any business, art, or anything that anybody does is empowered if they are loving what they are doing in the moment. There’s a quality that flows into what they do and that quality is felt by those who resonate with it.
So the moral of the story is, do what you love with no excuses.
So yes, I believe you are correct when you say  “In fact, this is what I believe true musicians do, they channel that universal spiritual energy into that piece of wood, those strings and the electrical energy of the guitar.”  But this holds true for anybody doing anything when they are connected to spirit.
We look into the world through a split mind, the spirit and the ego. This creates all the duality in the world we see. The Buddha, Jesus, Tolle and anybody that is consciously connected to spirit are all the same. We just see them as separate. They attract those that are in need of that particular language and teaching that a particular religion or spiritual guru etc, may be teaching. But we all end up in the same place in the end and that’s the recognition that we are truly and only spirit, and that our function is to allow that spirit to operate and manifest in the world through us. Once the majority of people make this discovery, the world will transform in ways that we can’t even imagine imagining right now.
– In this cold digital age, how do you bring the warmth of the analogue sound into your recordings?
One thing I do is keep an eye on the signal path and do my best to make sure everything is being sent through the best converters. Digital may never truly capture the warmth of analog, but that warmth to the ears of contemporary listeners is quickly being forgotten as something in the past.
– What piece or make of equipment live or studio have you used for your entire career, starting from Zappa to now, that you could not do without?
A whammy bar.
– I believe in the purity of the first take when recording, as I personally feel it exemplifies the pure creative energy and force at that moment in time. Do you think there is some truth to that in the creative sense, or that working over a piece with loads of takes/cuts is also part of the creative recording process?
It depends on the person performing it. Sometimes I like my first takes but not usually. I prefer to tweak things until they have all the elements I’m looking for which is the energy necessary for the track, something unique that I’ve never done before, all the right notes, a compelling melody to it, and other things.
There’s no right or wrong in either of these approaches, but I do recommend doing a few off-the-cuff takes before operating.
– Do you think that in the modern age, artists using the same template digital audio workstation linear software/plugins sort of makes everything similar? Before the software, musicians and artists did not have a visual sense of the music apart from paper and the mixing console, therefore it had more depth in my point of view because the artist was essentially forced to compose/visualise and feel the piece in their mind and through fluid emotion?
I would assume that the artist still has to visualize, and feel a piece of music in their minds regardless of the gear that is capturing it.
As we evolve through various generations of the evolution of the sound of music, it’s usually based on the gear that has evolved and that can give a generation a particular sound, but I don’t think the artists are so concerned with that. A music creator is usually subjected to the gear that is available at any given time in history, but it’s the notes and lyrics they choose that has the most powerful impact on the listener.
– How do you usually approach the creative process when composing music? Do you have any specific rituals or methods. Do you just noodle, let the fingers do the talking until something happens, or do you have a specific tune in your head that you want to transfer into reality?
It seems that when I am at my best, I visualize a song first. Perhaps not all the parts but the intention of the feeling, the tempo, perhaps a particular melody etc. I listen in my head instead of noodling with the fingers. But sometimes noodling can help. There’s no rules.
– Can you share any memorable or challenging moments from your collaborations with other artists or bands?
They all had their moments in one way or another. The last very memorable experience I had with another band was perhaps Hellfest when I went out and played “Still of the Night” with Whitesnake. It was their last show and the last song of their last show and I was able to be on stage with them. It was magnificent!
– Diamond Dave is a real dynamic character, can you recall a funny story about when you were in the DLR band in the 80s? Were there any specific challenges or highlights you encountered while touring and performing live with David Lee Roth’s band?
Every night after the show, Dave would throw a wild backstage party. I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THEM.
Dave basically carried around on tour a whole room that would be set up every night. It had curtains, great mood lighting, a HUGE PA where we would dance to rock music, (Back in Black usually) a ton of great food and drinks. These parties would be attended by the band, special friends, radio and record company people and perhaps 50 or so teenage girls dressed in 80s sparkle. They were all eager to meet the band and dance and other things.
– The music biz can be treacherous for some artists, and many have been sucked under by either the punishing contracts or the sex, fame, drugs, egoes and booze. How did you get through it all and survive, and do you have any tips for people navigating this maze right now?
I seemed to have always been more interested in the creative process of music and I made the music business my friend. My attitude was always that the music business was here for me and I was here for it. I’ve met many creative and eager people in it. If a person has a defeatist attitude or harbor a victim mentality, they will see the music business, or anything in their life, as threatening.
I’ve seen people get sucked under as you put it. In regard to sex I am sort of old fashioned and have been in a monogamous relationship for 40 years. I enjoy the fame because it’s not out of control but it can come with it’s challenges, I never really got into drugs or booze because I don’t like being controlled by anything and prefer a clear mind. Although I’ve dabbled in these things, the pull to create was always stronger. I guess I could be considered to be a bit nerdy for a rock star.
– Sorry, I am not really a fan of Tim Henson or his band Polyphia, or as I like to call it Polyfilla, which is a brand for a ready-to-use, multipurpose patching compound used on walls. I find their music is somewhat soulless and frankly boring, but that’s my point of view. At what point does the technical guitar and sample chopping of bands like Polyphia detract from the art of song making, in your personal view?
I don’t put up any barriers to how people make their music. It’s all fine with me. What I listen for in music is how connected the artist was in making it. Some artists are very connected with a digital workstation and can crank out some inspiring things, but it’s all subjective because people are different and respond to different things in the music they make and listen to. Some people love Polyphia.
– Your philanthropic work in music education is commendable. How important do you believe music education is in today’s world, and what motivated you to support it?
Music education is vitally important in the youngest years such as kindergarten, 1st-perhaps 7th grade. This is where the seeds can be planted or the interest can be recognized.
After that, music education is important to those that it resonates with. I’m referring to those people who instinctually feel they are musicians.
A person finds what they are looking for. I learned most of my music training in high school but continued to study through college and beyond because I love the language of music. But it’s not necessary to understand music theory to be an effective musician. That comes from someplace else.
– Could you share some insights into your creative process when developing and designing signature guitars and musical equipment?
I usually don’t set out to guess what will work or what might sell best. In the past, whenever I would design something it was usually based on something that I felt was missing that I wanted to have. Thats how the  Jem  came about. When I was designing it I was designing it specifically for myself. I had no idea if anyone else would like it and didn’t mind what anybody may have thought about it. I just added things that I thought would be good for me. That’s the case with anything innovative that has come through me.
– What can fans expect from your future projects or upcoming releases? Are there any exciting developments you’d like to share about your musical journey?
I’m still eager to create. I will be on tour a lot in 2024 and perhaps 2025, but I have a solo acoustic vocal record almost complete, and I have a few orchestra albums in the can that need some tweaking, and I’m working on a project that I hope to reveal in 2025 that I believe will be unique, accessible, engaging and impressive, but it’s too early to talk about it. For those interested, keep an eye on my socials. And thank you for all the support.
I recently finished my Inviolate full world tour and we did 194 shows in 51 countries. It was a transformative experience and I am eternally grateful to all those that attended and supported the shows. You rock!
Thank you so much for this opportunity…
Thank you!

Literary characters have the power to captivate readers and leave a lasting impact on society. They embody traits, values, and experiences that resonate with readers across generations. Let’s delve into the influence and timelessness of classic literary characters.
The Impact of Literary Characters on Society
Characters like Sherlock Holmes, Hamlet, Jane Eyre, and Jay Gatsby have become cultural icons, often embodying larger social themes. They have the ability to challenge societal norms, inspire change, and provide readers with a sense of escapism. These characters serve as a reflection of human nature, allowing readers to connect with their emotions, struggles, and aspirations.
For example, Sherlock Holmes, the brilliant detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, has had a profound impact on the genre of mystery and crime fiction. With his sharp intellect, keen observation skills, and deductive reasoning, Holmes has become the archetype of the detective figure. His influence can be seen in countless detective stories, films, and television series that have followed in his footsteps.
Similarly, Hamlet, the tragic hero of William Shakespeare’s play, has left an indelible mark on literature and theater. Hamlet’s internal struggle, his contemplation of life’s meaning, and his famous soliloquies have made him a symbol of existential angst. His character has been analyzed and interpreted by scholars and actors for centuries, exploring themes of revenge, madness, and the complexity of human nature.
Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Charlotte Brontë’s novel, is a character who defied societal expectations for women in the Victorian era. With her strong-willed nature, intelligence, and desire for independence, Jane Eyre challenged the traditional role of women as passive and submissive. Her story continues to inspire readers, particularly women, to pursue their own ambitions and assert their individuality.
Lastly, Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, “The Great Gatsby,” represents the American Dream and the pursuit of wealth and social status. Gatsby’s tragic story serves as a cautionary tale about the emptiness of materialism and the illusion of the American Dream. His character resonates with readers, reminding them of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of genuine human connections.
The Timelessness of Classic Literary Characters
Classic literary characters stand the test of time, transcending the era in which they were created. Characters like Romeo and Juliet, Elizabeth Bennet, and Captain Ahab continue to resonate with readers today, reaffirming the power of storytelling. These characters remain relevant because of the universal themes they explore, such as love, ambition, and the human condition.
Romeo and Juliet, the star-crossed lovers from William Shakespeare’s tragedy, have become synonymous with passionate and forbidden love. Their story of young love torn apart by feuding families has been adapted into numerous plays, films, and even modern retellings. The themes of love, fate, and the destructive power of hatred continue to captivate audiences, reminding them of the enduring power of love and the consequences of unchecked prejudice.
Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited heroine of Jane Austen’s novel, “Pride and Prejudice,” challenges societal expectations of women in the early 19th century. With her wit, intelligence, and refusal to conform to societal norms, Elizabeth Bennet has become an iconic character in literature. Her journey of self-discovery and her refusal to settle for a loveless marriage continue to inspire readers, particularly women, to prioritize their own happiness and independence.
Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain in Herman Melville’s novel, “Moby-Dick,” represents the destructive power of obsession and the human desire for revenge. Ahab’s relentless pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the consequences of harboring grudges. His character continues to resonate with readers, reminding them of the importance of balance and the perils of allowing one’s obsessions to consume them.
Classic literary characters have a profound impact on society and stand the test of time due to their ability to embody larger social themes and explore universal human experiences. Whether they challenge societal norms, inspire change, or provide readers with a sense of escapism, these characters continue to captivate readers across generations, reminding us of the power of storytelling and the enduring relevance of literature.
Now that we understand the significance of literary characters, let’s delve into some costume ideas that pay homage to them. Whether you’re an ardent fan of classic novels or prefer contemporary literature, there’s a literary character costume waiting to be brought to life.
Creating a Costume from Classic Novels
Classic novels offer a treasure trove of iconic characters to draw inspiration from. Whether you choose to don the attire of the sophisticated Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic Mr. Darcy, or the adventurous Alice from Wonderland, there is no shortage of options. Dive into the pages of your favorite classics and let your imagination run wild.
Modern Literary Characters for Costume Inspiration
Contemporary literature also presents an array of vibrant and memorable characters to draw inspiration from. You can become the witty and resourceful Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter series, the daring Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, or the mysterious Lisbeth Salander from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. These modern-day heroines and heroes allow for a unique and contemporary twist to your literary character costume.
Tips for Creating Your Literary Character Costume
Creating your own literary character costume can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some tips and tricks to help you bring your beloved character to life:
DIY Costume Tips and Tricks
Embrace your creative side by opting for a DIY costume. Research your character carefully, paying attention to their distinctive features and clothing style. Utilize thrift stores, your own wardrobe, and basic sewing skills to create an authentic and cost-effective costume. Don’t forget to add signature props or accessories to complete the look!
Incorporating Literary Elements into Your Costume
To truly capture the essence of your chosen character, consider incorporating elements from their literary world into your costume. For instance, if you’re dressing up as Sherlock Holmes, carry a magnifying glass or wear a deerstalker hat. These small details can make all the difference and enhance the overall impact of your costume.
While dressing up on World Book Day is undoubtedly enjoyable, it is essential to recognize the educational benefits that this celebration offers.

By dressing up as a favorite literary character, individuals have the opportunity to delve deeper into the author’s intent, the story’s themes, and the character’s role within the narrative. This exploration fosters a deeper appreciation for literature, encouraging readers to analyze and interpret the text in a meaningful way.
Encouraging Reading Through World Book Day Activities
In addition to dressing up, World Book Day activities often include book fairs, storytelling sessions, and author visits. These activities promote the pleasure of reading and motivate individuals to explore new books and authors. World Book Day is not just about dressing up as beloved characters; it is about creating a love for reading that extends far beyond the event itself.
World Book Day provides a unique opportunity to celebrate literature, ignite imagination, and indulge in the transformative power of storytelling. Whether you choose to become a classic literary character or embrace a modern-day hero, let your costume inspire others to embark on their own literary adventures. Let’s make every day a book day!",Entertainment

CLIVE BRANSON BIO
Clive Branson was an advertising creative director/copywriter for the past 25 years with agencies in Toronto, Bermuda and Ottawa. After retirement in 2015, he focused on being a freelance writer/photographer for several magazines – as a monthly contributor – concentrating on automotive, travel and lifestyle issues. He also assists a British agency as a proofreader and editor for any Canadian content for apps, websites, brochures, online advertising, print, and directing on-air talent for radio and TV commercials. Since 2012, Clive has been fortunate enough to have three books professionally published, including Focus on Close-Up and Macro Photography; Long Shadow of Yesterday (as the editor for a memoir based on his father’s experience as a young British officer in Palestine, India, Egypt, Trans-Jordan and Greece between 1945–1949); and Ford Mustang: The First Generation detailing the surreptitious account of how the Mustang was conceived, designed, marketed (the greatest sales numbers in its debut year in automotive history), saved the Ford Motor Company and became, not only their flagship car, but an American icon to this day. Clive has written and produced an 8-part TV series for Rogers on existing and emerging artists in Ottawa, and a retrospect of his marketing and photography in promoting Ottawa was accepted by Ottawa Library and Archives. Clive is married and lives in Ottawa, Ontario.",Entertainment
Brooklyn Beckham Cooked Meals are an Absolute Delight,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54623-brooklyn-beckham-cooked-meals-are-an-absolute-delight.html,2024,"Nepotism  is everywhere these days, and the celebrity offspring from Beckingham Palace, Brooklyn Beckham is another vile example of this sort of disgusting dalliance. Here we have an untalented dirty rich spoiled brat showing off the culinary delights some upmarket PR firm has concocted for him to parrot.
“Mummy and daddy paid the PR firm to hire a cook to try and make me copy what he cooked. All I can say is I tried,” the putrid little fuckstickle revealed in a recent tabloid spread.
Brooklyn Beckham is now selling ready meals in supermarkets at 10 to 15 quid a pot. Fancy some fancy pieces of processed cabbage dipped in a vomitus chemical laden sauce, that’ll be 15 pounds sir, fancy a Brooklyn Beckham stodgy processed curry with a piece of cardboard naan bread that’ll be 20 pounds madam.
If anyone buys this shit, they are either mentally ill or in need of a serious lobotomy. Do not furnish this cunt’s already overflowing bank account with even more money especially when the monstrous seeping gape hole doesn’t need any more money because his dad gives him millions per month anyway.
Broccoli dipped in what tastes like a tramp’s underpant puss comes in at a lofty £15, and it is preferable for a person to die a painful slow death burned alive at the stake than eat that horrid shit.
The celebrity Nepo offspring that the Beckhams have foisted upon the world are an actual weapon, they are filthy merchants of the grossest form of celebrity corruption and undeserved privilege. If this Brooklyn sphincter possesses a single talent, it is invariably in his vacant stare and gormless look — the kind of look that makes you want to smack him very hard with a baseball bat.

Britney Spears Needs Some New Furniture Pronto,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60923-britney-spears-needs-some-new-furniture-pronto.html,2025,"Whenever Britney Spears posts another video of her doing deranged, psychotic dances that are seriously demented, the real concern is with her furniture, it’s just so outdated.

Sure, Britney is a raving schizoid probably on god knows what drugs, but at least go to Ikea or something. Get a KNUTSTORP or a DAGSTORP or something that does not look so cheap and tired for fuck’s sake.
This poor woman looks like she is literally imprisoned in a motel lobby somewhere out in the Midwest from 1981.
If Britney reads this, which she will never do, please get some new furniture, so we can watch your  psychotic gyrations  knowing full well that you have taken the time to do something about the dire furniture situation in the background.
Better still, why not download an app that can remove the background completely, and maybe remove yourself from the videos too, wow, that would be a great bonus. Just post a blank video or something, anything is better than this utter, utter, useless shite.",Entertainment
The Empty Cinemas of Woke Snow White,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61125-the-empty-cinemas-of-woke-snow-white.html,2025,"Disney doubled-down on wokism by releasing an atrocious, disgusting woke Snow White remake defiling of the original Snow White film, which has been greeted with empty cinema seats across the globe.
“I’d rather have my eyes and ears gouged out with ice cream scoops than watch that woke shit,” some kid said in Los Angeles outside an empty IMAX theatre broadcasting the Disney film.
People genuinely have had enough.
By adopting the Marxist woke ideology, which defiles everything it infects, Disney have committed corporate suicide. Wokism murdered the  Star Wars  franchise, killed off  Indiana Jones , and now it’s woke Snow White’s turn.
The ironic part of this sorry affair is that these fuckers are so indoctrinated in woke theory and ideology that losing millions of dollars will still not awaken them from the woke indoctrination, they will double-down and triple-down until there is nothing left in their bank accounts.
Good luck with recouping the  $410 million  ($270 million for production) budget for this woke mess.
We can only hope they keep going, and going until they have nothing left. Well done, woke Disney. Keep going fuckers. Woke Snow White is an utter disgrace, and the woke Disney board of directors all need to be fired for this atrocious crime against cinema.
The original Snow White was nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards in 1938, and the next year, producer Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by Shirley Temple.
Its prototypical animated feature and use of fairy tale adaptations as well as technical innovation became a major milestone of the early animation industry, Snow White is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made and creating the new form of the golden age of animation; Disney’s take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural effect, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.
In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” and selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008.",Entertainment

Uninfluencers Are the New Social Media Trend,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/61365-uninfluencers-are-the-new-social-media-trend.html,2025,"Yes, we’ve all heard of “influencers” the annoying prats prancing around on social media claiming to be authorities on everything under the sun. Some snotty-nosed kid who claims he makes $40,000 a day trading the S&P 500 or some tarted up constantly smiling young woman touring the world’s hot spots whilst raking in large sponsorship deals for bouncing her pert tits in front of millions of male viewers. What about uninfluencers?
Social media expert Gregory Kilter is now studying a new breed of uninfluencers taking the stage.
“This is the new lucrative form of social media uninfluencing that is proving to be really popular now. Uninfluencing is basically the opposite of influencing and refers to the practice of basically telling people to either fuck right off, or putting them off entire product lines, or visiting a world location and giving it a good raking over.”
How did uninfluencing begin, and what platforms on the internet are best for this sort of thing?
“All social media platforms are now great for uninfluencing, and uninfluencers are not sure exactly who the first uninfluencer was, but there is a real fluid market building up for this genre right now.”
Uninfluencing is not free of danger, though, and some uninfluencers have already come to the profound realisation that uninfluencing swathes of people to not do or like something is still a form of influencing.",Entertainment

As I’m an economic migrant and thus a fake asylum seeker, why not become a fake pop star as well? Bing! Bong! Zang! Zin! The image of Gary Barlow appeared in my head like a large, bulbous turd being pushed out of an elephant’s arsehole! I want to become like him when they put me up in a five-star hotel with all the trimmings,” Abdul Razid Hamed from Paris, France recalled the other day.
Back in the five-star hotel in Hull, Hamed was auditioning dancers for his show as he sang to the hotel staff.
“Listen, Igomo, put the pizza down for a second, don’t they have pop groups in the Congo? Oh dear, this is not very good, is it. You’re meant to pirouette, like Robbie Williams did when he was in Take That.”
All this auditioning and practice was taking a toll on everyone, it was time to order more room service.
“I’ll have the fillet steak with chips, and bring that wonderful red wine you brought last time, yes, the 97. For dessert, I would like the Knickerbocker glory because that’s what Gary would have, wouldn’t he?”
The fake asylum seeker group then decided for a long swim in the luxurious indoor heated pool and a massage session to let the creative juices of pop stardom ruminate a little further.
“‘Ere have you seen the lady that does the massages? She looks like Posh Spice, she does. I’m going to ask her whether she can do a happy ending.

Allegations of bullying from multiple staff sources by serial schizoid narcissist Meghan Markle aren’t helping the issue either. Harry is fed up, he just wants to chill and do  drugs  without any comebacks. With  Trump breathing down his neck , Montecito could be out of the question and Amsterdam could be on the private jet list for a one way trip.
“Harry loves to snort Charlie, and he especially loves to do magic mushrooms and smoke ganja. Maybe do a bit of speed in the afternoon to pick things up a bit, and some acid tabs on the weekend. His main thang is yayo though, he can’t get enough of that chichi, especially on those private jet rides with a few glasses of champers. I heard, on one flight, he even snorted a few lines off Meghan’s ass cheek. It’s all above board stuff in Hollywood, but since the goddamn religious freaks are now in charge of the good ol’ U.S. of A, it’s all gone to shit!” a Hollywood drug dealer revealed.
America now seems rather restricted, and this is why Amsterdam is now on the agenda.
In Amsterdam, it’s so  liberal  that the police help you pick up your stash if you drop a load in front of them by accident. Hard drugs are more available than candy, and they pioneered drug cafés where you can smoke hash all day without anyone batting an eyelid.
Want to do something heavier? Amsterdam’s liberal drug policies even give out free drug paraphernalia like syringes and methadone if you’re out of the Afghan, and there are designated areas specifically for shooting up.
For Harry, Amsterdam would be like a fucking drug paradise where he could indulge in the things he loves doing, whilst Meghan stays on at home in the kitchen filming Netflix cookery shows. She better cook some of those delightful hash cakes though, huh!
In his autobiography ‘Spare’ Harry describes in detail about his penchant for taking copious amounts of drugs, and it is obvious that he misses those carefree days. Looks like the clock is ticking, though, they better get on it before that Trump guy comes a knockin’,",Entertainment

The Duchess of Sussex has been pulled into the  bitter dispute  between Prince Harry and the Sentebale charity after claims from a staff member that Meghan Markle farted into her tomato soup.
A well-placed source has revealed that the frosty relationship between Meghan and the charity’s staff is one of the many reasons to blame for the feud between the Duke of Sussex and the charity chair.
Last month, Prince Harry stepped down from his role as a trustee of Sentebale – a charity set up in 2006 to help people in Southern Africa living with HIV and Aids.

“The Duchess of Sussex immediately came over, looked me up and down, then turned around with her bottom over my soup. She then let off a large fanny fart into the soup. The ferocity of the fart made my soup ripple.
“It was really awful, it smelled of rotten fruit salad and sardines.
“She then took out a little bag from her purse and sprinkled some dry flowers over my soup before walking out of the room without saying a word to anyone.
“I just sat there holding my nose in absolute shock and disgust,” the Sentebale staff member recounted.

Oh dear! A Boy Band Member Has Fallen From a Hotel Balcony,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57990-oh-dear-a-boy-band-member-has-fallen-from-a-hotel-balcony.html,2024,"Apparently, according to the mainstream media, a boy band member and corporate  Simon Cowell  creation flung himself from a hotel balcony in Argentina after allegedly infusing himself with numerous types of strange powders and other stuff. We never heard of this guy, so after a Google search found out that the geezer’s name rhymes with the words “lame”, “drain” and “insane”.
Obviously this is a tragic loss for the world of music, a huge talented musician has passed away, what an absolute travesty. Let’s hope no other corporate creations decide to go the same direction as this poor guy.
Will the world of music ever survive this loss? Will this boy band member be immortalised in 100 years from now, or maybe two weeks? Who knows? Perhaps, Beethoven and Mozart have finally met their match.
It’s all right for Simon Cowell though because he can now release the definitive best of compilation of whatever the autotune boy band was called and rake in some serious bucks for a brief moment in time. Maybe Cowell needs a new fleet of Bentleys?
This poor boy band member must’ve been a true talent because even the celebrity Katie Price came out of some crucial tit balloon surgery to comment on this poor sod’s demise. It must have really hit home for her to do that.
Warning!
There’s only one direction to go when you jump from a fucking hotel balcony — down. Be careful out there, folks, it’s a dangerous world and bad shit sometimes happens, especially when something like gravity is involved.",Entertainment

Mud Pit to be Installed in Oval Office For Presidential Debates,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60624-mud-pit-to-be-installed-in-oval-office-for-presidential-debates.html,2025,"Great news for fight fans! The White House has proudly announced the installation of a mud pit in the middle of the Oval Office where  presidential debates  will take place.
“We’re thinking of making the events Pay-Per-View because we kinda need the money, you know. Every little thing helps. Have you seen our debt levels? Sheesh. That war in Ukraine sure did not help with that,” president Donald Trump told the assembled reporters in the Oval Office, invited to have a look for themselves.
One reporter from CNN accidentally tripped on her stilettoes and fell into the pit headfirst.
Immediately cheers went up in the Oval Office, as she struggled around in the mud, her shirt coming off revealing a thrilling sight for the assembled onlookers.
“Look at CNN go! Whoah! Thanks for demonstrating how the pit works. Okay, get her a towel, someone,” vice president J.D. Vance quipped.
The assembled members of the press all cheered at the good sport of the reporter as she left to get a much-needed shower.
The Oval Office has become associated in Americans’ minds with the presidency itself through memorable images, such as a young John F. Kennedy, Jr. peering through the front panel of his father’s desk, President Richard Nixon speaking by telephone with the Apollo 11 astronauts during their moonwalk, and Amy Carter bringing her Siamese cat Misty Malarky Ying Yang to brighten her father President Jimmy Carter’s day.
Several presidents have addressed the nation from the Oval Office on occasion. Examples include Kennedy presenting news of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), Nixon announcing his resignation from office (1974), Ronald Reagan following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster (1986), and George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks (2001).",Entertainment
“Hanoi Jane” is Wrong About “Empathy” and Soviet Marxist Construct “Woke”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60553-hanoi-jane-is-wrong-about-empathy-and-soviet-marxist-construct-woke.html,2025,"Dredged up from the mothballed archives of Hollywood’s communist propaganda department, Hanoi Jane is back, and this time she is claiming that only “woke” people have empathy. This method of deliverance of woke propaganda is quite standard, as what  wokism  does is it takes something that has existed before and subverts it into its own Marxist soviet agenda. Empathy has existed as a human emotion ever since humanity existed, and did not just appear when communism or socialism were created. As for empathy, as is the case with socialists and communists, they always hijack elements for their own gain and pervert these elements and absorb them into their political agenda. Jane Fonda is a devout Marxist, Saul Alinsky acolyte who committed treason against her own country, but was spared because of her Hollywood celebrity status. She even called the poor American POWs who were mercilessly tortured by the communists as “war criminals”. Pol Pot was invariably another one of her heroes. She also allegedly passed notes given to her by POWs begging for help to the North Vietnamese, resulting in more torture. We will probably never know if these rumours were ever true or not, but that’s “empathy” for you right there.
Hanoi Jane, Tokyo Rose, Lord Haw-Haw
The wokist agenda is an authoritarian cultural Marxist construct consisting of elements of hyper-sensitive political correctness and a form of indoctrination targeting young people especially that is truly insidious. It claims to be “INCLUSIVE” yet is “EXCLUSIVE” because it is so far to the left, everything else to the right is deemed as bad and excluded/cancelled/censored. By cancelling everything to the right of the extreme left, including any form of discussion, one could even postulate that wokism is a totalitarian construct despite claiming to be inclusive and progressive. Its primary role is to destabilise,  demoralise  and weaken the West generationally from within and to infiltrate all state departments, governmental offices, education, media, advertising.
There is no empathy for the people that wokism cancels, calls riots on, or destroys entire neighbourhoods. The multiple BLM riots were a good example of this form of communist subversive activity.
Hanoi Jane is a communist agitator, she did not have any empathy for the American kids sent to fight in Vietnam. She had zero empathy for them, and as is the case in the binary world of wokism, she cancelled those people and instead embraced her communist friends and the red flag of Ho Chi Minh. Tortured American POWs were labelled as “war criminals” by a woke creature who claims to have “empathy”.
Please return to your mothballed state Hanoi Jane, where you can preach your moral superiority to the other mothballed celebrity communists, Marxists, socialists who are so high and mighty in their fucking woke wokeness in their echo chambers. Hang your motherfucking rotting corpse of a head in eternal disgraceful shame, for you will always be known as Hanoi Jane.",Entertainment
Netflix Subscription Levels Would Shoot Up if Meghan Markle Dumped,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60271-netflix-subscription-levels-would-shoot-up-if-meghan-markle-dumped.html,2025,"Something has been dragging Netflix down like a dead weight for the past few years, yep, it’s called Meghan Markle. Everyone knows she is allegedly a greedy, narcissistic egotistical control-freak  bully , but what’s worse is that she is toxic to any company or brand. Anything she touches turns to shit, because she has the reverse Midas touch — she’s got the Minus touch.
News is in La La Land that the Difficult Duchess, a fourth rate actress, has stepped on so many toes and bullied so many people that even the Americans have had enough of her.
Netflix is reportedly facing mounting internal and public backlash over Meghan Markle’s latest woke self-indulgent, self aggrandising project,  With Love, Meghan , as concerns grow regarding the show’s performance and the controversies surrounding its lead figure.
According to insider reports, the streaming giant’s board of directors has taken significant steps to distance the company from Markle, including barring her from test screening sessions and limiting her promotional opportunities.
The controversy surrounding Markle escalated after test screenings of  With Love, Meghan  reportedly received negative feedback.
Sources indicate that Markle was present at these screenings, where she allegedly reacted negatively to unfavourable critiques, labelling test viewers as biased, racist and misogynist. This prompted Netflix CEO Greg Peters and the board to exclude her from future screenings, a decision aimed at mitigating further internal conflict.
Additionally, Markle’s plans to deliver a speech at the 2025 Academy Awards, which was expected to include a segment on the  Los Angeles wildfires  while promoting  With Love, Meghan , have been halted.
Netflix reportedly intervened by appealing to the Academy, which ultimately decided to bar her from making the speech. The decision has sparked further tension between Markle and Netflix, with the Duchess of Sussex allegedly preparing a legal response.
Beyond Netflix, major Hollywood studios—including Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros.—have reportedly shown reluctance to work with Markle on future projects.
Industry insiders suggest that her declining popularity and the controversies surrounding her public appearances have made studios hesitant to invest in her toxic involvement.
Despite the mounting resistance, some members of Netflix’s board remain supportive of Markle and are pushing for a second season of  With Love, Meghan , which has already been conceptualised as a contingency plan should the show secure a renewal.
However, a growing faction within the company is advocating for severing ties with Markle altogether, citing concerns over declining audience engagement and potential reputational damage.
The handling of Markle’s project comes as Netflix navigates a delicate balancing act between financial viability and public perception.
Analysts suggest that  With Love, Meghan  could significantly impact the company’s subscription metrics, prompting a wave of cancellations.
Meanwhile, Markle has reportedly begun reaching out to alternative platforms and production houses in search of new opportunities.
With tensions continuing to rise, the outcome of Netflix’s internal deliberations will likely determine the next phase of Markle’s entertainment career.
As the situation develops, all eyes remain on whether Netflix will stand firm in its decision-making or yield to internal and external pressures.",Entertainment

The New Craze Taking Over Progressives and Woke Social Justice Extremists,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/59231-the-new-craze-taking-over-progressives-and-woke-social-justice-extremists.html,2024,"They are the most hated people in the world, the automaton virtue signalling indoctrinated little Stalins and little Hitlers who think they are morally above everyone else, where they claim to be woke “progressives” but are in fact  intolerant  regressives who are addicted to deluded ‘trendy’ omnicauses and are  outrage-seeking  fucking morons.
Well, they have found a new craze, and for a change this one seems to be rather useful.
According to media reports in California, and places like Islington and Hackney in the UK, woke people are flocking to specialist surgeons to undergo a proprietary treatment that has been resurrected from the 1940s. Yes, we’re talking lobotomies. It’s the new woke trend for the wokerati, and far-left Marxist social justice warriors are loving it.
British and American universities have also seen an up tick in both woke students and the tutors who indoctrinate them, flocking to the surgeons to have their frontal lobe’s severed.
The surgical procedure was pioneered by the Portuguese neurologist and Nobel Laureate António Egas Moniz in 1935. The lobotomy (Leucotomy) involves severing connections in the brain’s prefrontal cortex. The surgery causes most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, to be severed.
Professor Almada Rinkin, who has performed over 1,500 lobotomies on progressive woke patients in the last three months, has revealed the simplicity of the operation and its amazing results.
“We bring these raving extremist lunatics who wrongly call themselves “progressives” into the operating room and give them some general anaesthetic. Some of them continue babbling on about whichever cause they are fighting that particular week. It’s okay, we let them babble on. Before the procedure, they are clearly indoctrinated by some sort of ideology, but after a few tweaks to their frontal lobe, a little slicing here or there, boom! They are cured. We tested one blue-haired woman who came in ranting about the virtues of throwing orange paint over priceless paintings in art galleries for the cause of the environment. After the procedure, which took less than half an hour, the patient did not even know what an oil painting was or even cared about such things as eco causes.
“On another occasion, a patient could not stop ranting about the virtues of transgender men in women’s sports and shower rooms. We cured this person in less than fifteen minutes. After the procedure, we showed the patient a photograph of a large man with a moustache wearing a dress whilst playing volleyball for an all-female team. The patient did not even twitch or acknowledge the subject matter in the photo.”
Because of the demand for the operations, there is now a large backlog of woke progressives awaiting the surgical procedure, and although it is not advised, some are performing the procedure on themselves. If you are a woke progressive, please do not use a pencil or other sharp object on yourself, you must seek professional medical advice first so that your illness can be cured in a clinical, safe environment.",Entertainment

Prince Harry is thus on a mission to whip the American peasants into shape and compliance.
According to Montecito aides and PR agents, Prince Harry finds Americans to be “…a disgusting lot of fat, junk food swilling, loud mouthed, opinionated morons who wrongly think they own the entire globe”. What’s more, Americans do not bow in the prince’s presence, which has been a bone of contention since arriving in North America. This imbecilic outrage irks the prince to no end.
It is also the wish of Harry to disarm the Americans of their right to bear arms and to dismantle the US Constitution, which the prince thinks is “completely useless”. Loose cannon Harry got into trouble a few years back when he called the  First Amendment  “bonkers”.
Despite being a military man who was once a gunner on a helicopter, the prince wants to see every American put their guns down because it would make the country a “safer place”. This narrative of disarming decent hard-working Americans, naturally has not gone down well with many Americans accusing the prince of being a “pompous limey asshole”.
“Who the fuck does this limey prince guy who came from Brit land to the USA think he fucking is calling us American peasants? We don’t bow our heads to his bullshit, and we don’t give up arms for anyone. Go back to the UK, where they hate you even more than we do,” one angry American was quoted as saying.

“Tarantino has delved into pretty much every film genre, but he has not touched science fiction, which with his immaculate approach and talent would be the crowning glory to his career. This is what I have here, it is the most amazing fucking script I have written, but sadly Tarantino will never get to read it, adjust it, play with it, and film it.
“How the fuck do you make your final film to top off the  masterpieces  you made previously? That’s the 200 million dollar question that no one dares to bring up.”
So why will this so-called ‘amazing’ script never get to Tarantino?
“I’ll tell you fucking why. I’m a nobody. I just got thrown out of the WME offices head fuckin’ first. No one wants to speak to me, and Quentin’s agent is completely inaccessible. When everything, every damn door is closed off to new talent, and new creative ideas, no wonder Hollywood is in such trouble and drowning in morose crap.

This despicable exploitative creature manipulated many poor Cubans purely for profit in his videos, which make hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad revenue.
The worst part about the egotistical user YouTube traveller, Kurt Caz is that he knew he was in a communist country, and he knew that by exposing how ordinary Cubans have to get by in their poverty-stricken country that these people he filmed would get into serious trouble, but because he was more concerned with the revenue and subscribers he would gain from exposing these poor people, he carried on without any form of conscience or responsibility for his actions.
Cuban Communist Dictatorship
In Cuba, many activities are deemed as illegal by the secret police who answer to the communist party ruling the country. However, can one blame the people steeped in severe poverty for doing illegal stuff to put food on their table? This is what Curt Kaz exploited, and it is a truly shameful act. The people Kurt Caz exploited who are now serving 20-year jail terms will think about Kurt Caz every day in the horrible Cuban prisons where they will rot away.
In the video below, you can see this guy showing off his Ferrari while he wines and dines some exploited Venezuelan girl in the UAE.

Episodes of Woke Star Wars Series The Acolyte Used For Interrogation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57241-episodes-of-woke-star-wars-series-the-acolyte-used-for-interrogation.html,2024,"Forget about waterboarding, or having your teeth pulled out without anaesthetic, the first and only season of woke Star Wars series  The Acolyte  could be utilised by multiple intelligence agencies who need to extract information from terrorists and foreign spies.
A spokesman for an intelligence agency situated in South East Asia, who did not wish to be named, disclosed that  The Acolyte  is so bad and cringeworthy to watch that some captured spies actually preferred to have their fingernails pulled out with pliers.
“Extracting information can be a tiresome but necessary affair, however with  The Acolyte , it is easier than we thought. We simply put the person in front of a screen and have their eyes taped open so they cannot shut them. They have to watch the entire series of  The Acolyte  in one sitting, but many do not make it past the third episode.”
The Acolyte  is a very effective method for making spies crack and spill the beans, and many other agencies are now looking to use this method for their interrogation processes.
“You want to see people practically crawling up the walls and pulling their hair out and begging to give you the information that you need? Use  The Acolyte . It is the most effective method we have found yet, although some say it is too intensive a form of torture for information extraction. Some of the people we interrogate with this method are severely affected with PTSD, and some have even gone into a state of coma, or shaking uncontrollably after watching just one episode. We want to thank the woke pissants who created this $180 million monstrosity. The worst blood-curdling acting from the likes of woke diversity pick Amandla Stenberg, a racist piece of shit. Deluded morons Leslye Headland and  Kathleen Turner . It’s a work of horrific, cringeworthy grotesque wokery that not only killed off Star Wars but kills actual brain cells in people who are forced to watch it.”
Thanks to  The Acolyte  interrogation rooms are now efficient information extraction zones where even the most hardened espionage participant cracks within minutes.
The Acolyte  received an 18% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes despite paid industry reviewers giving it a 78% score. Even though the production cost $180 million (not including marketing budget of $56 million) it has only managed to recoup $24 million in costs so far.
There will  not be a second series , and hopefully we will never see the cast members (apart from Carrie-Anne Moss) and producers ever again.",Entertainment
Worried About Safety? Colombian Drug Cartel Preparing For Harry and Meghan Visit,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/57062-worried-about-safety-colombian-drug-cartel-preparing-for-harry-and-meghan-visit.html,2024,"Apparently, Colombia is safer than the UK, which at the moment is strangely believable. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will travel to the South American country this summer at the invitation of its primary drug lord Miguel Suarez III Esq. for the Medellín Colombian drug cartel. The Sussexes recently undertook a royal tour to the equally safe country of  Nigeria .
During their visit, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tour the many cooking facilities and coca growing fields that the Colombian drug cartel owns. They will also view the many types of distribution centres and methods the drug cartel uses to move their product around the globe. The cartel even owns a submarine fleet used to smuggle cocaine and fentanyl into Miami.
Royal commentator, Barney Pupples, was briefed on the Sussex itinerary for the royal tour.
“Prince Harry is quite excited about the trip, as we all know he is very partial to the  white stuff , or as they call it – yayo. The lavish villas where the Sussexes will be accommodated are all heavily guarded by cartel goons, and they even have Gatling guns mounted on pickup trucks and helicopter gunships, so don’t worry, Harry and Meghan will be safe as long as there is no cartel war or government crackdown.”
Colombia is described by the US government as a “Level 3” or “orange” risk, with advice stating: “Reconsider travel due to crime and terrorism. Exercise increased caution due to civil unrest and kidnapping.”
In the country summary published by the Bureau of Consular Affairs, it says: “Violent crime, such as homicide, assault, and armed robbery, is widespread. Organised criminal activities, such as extortion, robbery, and kidnapping, are common in some areas.”
The UK government advice for the country suggests only essential travel to some regions of the country and to consider extreme caution.
The drug lord and head of the Colombian drug cartel that the Sussexes will be visiting gave his assurance that the British royal couple will be treated well and everything was safe.
“Don’t worry, we gonna keep the fuckin’ royal family safe. If any of those fuckin’ cockroaches or putas from the government come near them, we will blow them all to kingdom fuckin’ come.  If I even sniff any bullshit from Gaspar Gomez and the Diaz Brothers, those motherfucking cockroach sons of bitches will be squashed. No problemo, we got this one in the bag. I’m invincible. Plata o plomo you choose motherfucking cockroach pieces of mierde. Hey, we even gotta zoo here, Meghan and Harry will fucking love it.

He hastily married a woman who sort of turned out to be his Div Master and a Prae along with being a hard-hitting matron, all at the same bloody time.
The former working royal does not get much of a jaunt up Judy’s Passage any more, so he has to do a few solo walks by himself, relegated to the non-specialist ways.
He also does not care for cricket at Mespots either, and is consequently now not even known as a dry Bob. In fact, what does Harry do all day anyway? He’s as useless as a Slack Bob munching away on his tucker at Rowland’s inanely with no solid mission at hand.
No Pop
In the early days of the ill-fated marriage, he was often sent up for good, but these days, there is none of that, just plain old rip after rip and bills.
What the Div Master Wants, the Div Master Gets
The Beak gives Harry the fixtures, and he has to abide by them without fail, otherwise all hell breaks loose and his tuck box will be empty for the next month, worse still, he might even have to bend over for the Conduct as punishment.
Sent off for chores is also de rigueur; doing this photo shoot, calling the PR men, calling the lawyers, calling  Netflix  for more cash, and all that tedious stuff.
Being stuck in some morose Yankee land is conjointly playing on the prince’s emotional strings.

Now They’re Coming After Russell Brand As Well,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52894-now-theyre-coming-after-russell-brand-as-well.html,2023,"The Daily Squib has been attacked by certain nefarious EU companies since the Referendum and Brexit trying to take us down, and now poor old Russell Brand is being attacked for his playful days while he was digging for gold in between the legs of many, many women. According to his YouTube channel, Brand is now being accused of certain allegations regarding the multiples of women he slept with in the past.
These are the vagaries and dangers of having an opinion other than is allowed in the Mainstream Media in a Western civilisation which is seriously moving towards a more authoritarian sovietised stance led by the Chinese communist model of censorship and totalitarian media control. With ESG and the  WEF , and EU dictating censorship rules, the West is daily declining and moving away from democracy and free speech.
The voices speaking the truth are viewed as dangerous by the soviet censors who are now in charge and have infiltrated all media and politics. This is why publications like the Daily Squib are now in danger; where satire was once a protected literary genre in the past, we are now in danger of being shut down and our voice forever silenced. The same goes for Russell Brand, a man who certainly shoots from the hip, who dares to uncover the truth from many corrupt facets of society, business and politics. Admittedly, some of his titles on his YouTube and Rumble videos are obvious clickbait, and pander to the ‘conspiracy theory’ movement, but where there is smoke, there is invariably fire.
We joked about Russell Brand in the past, thinking he was some kind of dilettante, but we now know he is the real deal. The problem with speaking the truth and uncovering all sorts of nastiness going on under the noses of the masses is that you have to have a damn squeaky clean reputation to do this. If there are any doubts, events in the past or morally unacceptable things in one’s character, your enemies will zero in on these and destroy your reputation. It happens all the time with politicians vying for election. Being a public figure is a dangerous endeavour, more so these days than in the past. The amount of data being analysed and filtered through the machine of moral outrage is increasing daily.
As the Daily Squib is constrained and limited in what it can write these days, we cannot express our satirical dark humour as we wish anymore. Russell Brand is a character who has tried to seek the truth, and we commend him for that, however in doing so, he put himself into the crosshairs of the woke #metoo soviet snipers who are now out for blood. Maybe, Brand quotes praising the Metoo movement in the past were part of his liberal sensibility to endorse such witch-hunts, it is also rather ironic that his downfall may be precipitated by the weaponised usage of the Feminazi group against him.
We can only wish Russell luck in fighting the vultures and parasites now chomping down and feeding off his wildly spinning chakras, sucking the very life force from his soul.
Western civilisation is fast being subverted and corrupted by the hyper-sensitive puritanical forces of evil communist censors, and from here life will be a dark, dystopian, Orwellian nightmare that you will try to wake up from but will be imprisoned within the echo chamber of political correctness created by the jailers who now control everything.

Labour War on Private Schools: “Hogwarts May be Forced to Close”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/56276-labour-war-on-private-schools-hogwarts-may-be-forced-to-close.html,2024,"Comrade Starmer and his Marxist Labour Muggles are so intent on  ruining  private schools by taxing school fees, that the famous wizard school where Harry Potter and his chums attended could be forced to close as well, the Daily Prophet newspaper has revealed. The Labour war on private schools and Hogwarts is really heating up.
“This is Muggle persecution gone mad” screams one of the headlines from the Daily Prophet.
Many wizarding parents have also chimed in to the outrage by writing in their concerns.
Argus Mendacious a parent of two Hogwarts pupils, Jenny, 12, and Rodney, 14, went absolutely ballistic upon hearing the news from the Muggle Marxist shisters Labour and their useless war on private schools.
“Just because these Labour Muggles and squibs think it will bring in more money so they can spend it all on black hole socialist tin-pot money pit projects and bloated Big State salaries, they have no bloody idea what they are doing. Hogwarts is an institution that educates the next generation of wizards and is crucial to keeping the equilibrium between our magical world and the Muggle world. If Hogwarts goes, guess who wins? Yes, it will be Voldemort and the dastardly Malfoys.”
Indeed, this Muggle Labour mess plays right into the hands of Voldemort, who many suspect is behind all of this chicanery.
Gryffindor to the rescue
Nelson Huffapup, a recently graduated wizard from Gryffindor, chimed in with a solid plan to somehow avert certain destruction for the school of magic.
“I say we all concentrate on Comrade Starmer and blast him with Obliviate. If enough of us do it at the same time, he will be given a magical lobotomy, and he won’t even know his name or where he is. If any other Labour Party muggle tries anything, we do the same to them. Obliviate and then the banishing charm Depulso.”
Hogwarts’ illustrious history
The wonderful and very private magical school, Hogwarts was founded around the 9th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin.
Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches, as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution.
Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles.",Entertainment

Like to look through rose-tinted glasses and delude yourself about the harsh realities occurring on a daily basis in the world, then Zuckerberg’s new Twitter clone heavily censored social media site is for you. If you are a shallow, no news kind of person who cannot cope with reality, then you are most welcome at this fake, plastic, echo chamber for the new breed of deluded intolerant liberals devoid of any real awareness intent on heavy censorship of everything.
We can assure the public that they are better off letting corporate and government censors protect them from harmful thoughts
Who wants to know about the harsh realities and problems that face humanity within the fields of politics, conflict and society? Instead, you are a putrid coward with no dignity and one of those Instagram plastic banal narcissists only concerned with portraying a fake image of your ‘wonderful’ inane artificial existence while Zuckerberg strips you of all your data, profiting off it.
Embrace the Marxist echo chamber where reality does not exist, and you are indoctrinated daily in woke ideology, virtue signalling and inane otiose chatter that wastes your limited time on this earth talking about utter useless shit that serves no purpose but to squander time.
Brain prison
Zuckerberg’s new Twitter clone is just another digital lobotomy for the putrid brainless masses to indulge themselves in, and this is a service served well by the Meta corporation creating these awful horrible digital prison atrocities daily.
One can only hope that Zuck’s Meta World or whatever it is called in the future will have all these fuckers locked into comatose states with these programs linked directly to their central neocortex. It will certainly be a quieter world as they are all in their darkened rooms enacting their dreams of social media stardom in states of utter silence and rigidity. This will be death before actual physical death, as they are entertained to become ineffectual human voids, useless pieces of meat in permanent vegetative states. They will most certainly be fed through tubes and their waste siphoned out of them, reconditioned, then probably fed back to them. Once their hearts stop pumping, they will be put into acid baths and liquified, and the nutrients fed back to the comatose idiots still linked to the system.
Musk’s Twitter is no different to Zuckerberg’s creepy censorship prisons. Heavy-handed censorship is still prevalent on the site, even after the previous regime was supposedly turfed out. Despite promising change, sites like the Daily Squib are still permanently shadowbanned on Twitter.

Saturation Kills Everything,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51338-saturation-kills-everything.html,2023,"I magine a time when there was only one TV station, only a few radio stations and the odd cinema blockbuster. Buying a vinyl record of your favourite band from a shop made your entire universe, at a concentrated level, you dedicated your entire attention to every nuance, every tiny detail of this piece of music consisting of about six tracks on each side. Even the album cover and sleeve notes, and back cover were pored over. You actually enjoyed, and were genuinely thrilled by whatever you were listening to on the record.
This was the ultimate point of music distribution simply because the listener had such little choice, their attention was entirely dedicated to only what was chosen to be released and these mere morsels of creativity activated the listener entirely. For record companies and artists, that was the apex of the entire history of music.
The same could be applied to those great moments of cinema, where historically defining films were shown to audiences for the first time. There was no internet of things where entire catalogues of films are downloaded or streamed in seconds.
The same applies to books, because the brains of those of the era were not addled with complete mental saturation from all quarters, there was instead clarity in thought, and space to ruminate, space in time where silence was part of the fabric of not only creativity but of appreciation of art in all its forms.
Saturation overkill is the realm of today, where the human brain has been rewired with an attention span of maybe less than two seconds. Just like saturation bombing over Dresden during WW2 killed literally hundreds of thousands of German civilians overnight; so too is there a saturation onslaught on the human brain today. There is no time for the listener to listen because he has to switch over to the next song that is even better, or for whatever reason he has been programmed to almost listen to something whilst watching another thing and twiddling on his phone simultaneously.
Saturation kills stardom, it kills fame, and music personas these days are not revered as the true stars were in the past. There is no real fame anymore, and the numbers do not mean shit. Getting 900 million gazillion listens or views do not mean anything in a world of saturation, simply because many people did not actually listen, and many companies can buy bots by the billion to exact fake views/listens.
Saturation of everything in a mish mash deadly soup of bullshit all dumped into your brain at once is what today is, and it has rendered nearly everything as meaningless. Saturation of analysis kills the magic of art, but today everything is overanalysed and YouTube analysis videos saturate everything, killing the mystique and artistry of what was once a magical piece of artistic expression for someone. Everything, is now a throwaway item simply to be discarded and replaced by another momentary piece of shit. Even the good old stuff, pre-internet, is now discarded and a mere moment in time.
Saturation of news, and entertainment and porn, and all the other shit that goes with every genre, every keyword, and every known piece of knowledge eventually amounts to nothing much, and there you are constantly flicking from one thing to the next, your attention span is now less than a millisecond, and you do not know who you are anymore, or who you were, and you ingest all these things the propagandists tell you to do, they say you are woke, so you are woke now. You don’t even know what it means or why, but you follow blindly because you have been programmed to do so. Through repetition, through saturation bombing of each individual, each group, you do not have a sense of concrete mind anymore, they have changed the wiring in your brain permanently. You are addicted to all of this and you cannot stop. No one will ever know and experience those beautiful time filled pre-internet days ever again.",Entertainment
When Gonzo Met Serge Gainsbourg,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51255-when-gonzo-met-serge-gainsbourg.html,2023,"Serge Gainsbourg was a goddamn lunatic. A madman of music, a savant of smut, a maverick of melody. He was a genius, a degenerate, a saint, and a sinner all rolled into one. And for anyone with half a brain and a shred of taste, he was one of the greatest musicians of all time.
I first heard Gainsbourg’s music back in the day, when I was living high on the hog and chasing the American Dream. And let me tell you, it was like nothing I’d ever heard before. The man was a fucking magician, weaving together elements of jazz, funk, rock, and pop into a sound that was entirely his own. He had a voice like a rusty chainsaw, but he could sing like an angel when he wanted to. And his lyrics were pure poetry, even when he was singing about the filthiest things you could imagine.
But what really set Gainsbourg apart was his complete lack of give-a-fuck. He didn’t care what anyone thought of him or his music. He was a true outsider, a rebel without a cause, a punk before punk was even a thing. He pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, and he did it with style, flair, and a shit-eating grin.
And let’s not forget his legendary love life. The man was a walking, talking sex scandal, bedding some of the most beautiful women in the world and scandalizing polite society in the process. He was a wild man, a libertine, a lothario, and a legend.
But even beyond all the hype and the scandal, Gainsbourg was the real deal. He was a true artist, a master of his craft, and a visionary. He created music that was both beautiful and ugly, pure and profane, sophisticated and raw. He was a poet of the perverse, a bard of the bizarre, a troubadour of the taboo.
And now, years after his death, his music still sounds as fresh, as daring, as utterly fucking insane as it did when he first recorded it. He was a true original, a one-of-a-kind, a force of nature. And if you’re not listening to him right now, you’re missing out on one of the greatest musical experiences of your life.
Serge Gainsbourg. The man, the myth, the fucking legend. Bow down and pay your respects, you poor, sad, unenlightened motherfuckers.",Entertainment
Heavy Class A Drug User Prince Harry Urged to Stop Using,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/51225-heavy-class-a-drug-user-prince-harry-urged-to-stop-using.html,2023,"For the sake of his kids, Prince Harry is urged to try to stop using class-A drugs, a drug charity has revealed in a new campaign.
“Drug use may seem like fun at first, but soon things can spiral out of control. We have seen that Prince Harry glorifies and encourages drug use in his book Spare, but heavy drug use can be detrimental to mental health and physical health as well. This is why Harry is going to all these therapists because his heavy drug use of the past and present is affecting his mental stability. Please get help, not only for yourself, but for the sake of your children. We would like to direct Prince Harry to a drug rehabilitation unit, so he can overcome his drug dependency,” Raquel Minchin, a senior anti-drug spokeswoman for US drug charity ‘StopNow’ revealed on Thursday.
Heavy drug use can cause schizophrenia, paranoia and manic depression. Many people who take drugs are searching for the first high they experienced when they first took the drug, but they will never get that first high ever again. In many cases, the drug use then escalates and is soon uncontrollable, leading to multiple problems.
Prince Harry is meant to be a role model and celebrity, but his drug use misleads many young people who think it is cool to take drugs.
Because of his celebrity status in the United States, Prince Harry is allowed to get away with everything, and even entered the country by omitting key details about his drug use on the visa form. Harry has never taken responsibility for anything in his life, and thinks he is entitled to do anything he wants without any form of repercussion.
Harry is thus urged to at least tone down the heavy drug use during the  Coronation of King Charles , where he and his wife Meghan Markle have been invited.",Entertainment

Apparently the Daily Squib is in the Top 30 Feedspot.com Satire Sites,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49432-apparently-the-daily-squib-is-in-the-top-30-feedspot-com-satire-sites.html,2023,"We are not one for charts, but we are here to promote Feedspot.com — a great place to add your RSS feed if you have a website delving into any niche subject or genre. We were informed of our inclusion on the list only today, by the lovely people at  Feedspot.com .
Although some of the listings are questionable, for example: Snopes is on the list, but the parasitical scum  Mikkelson  who ran that awful website would not know satire if it slapped him on his fat bloated head. They are lauded as the holders of all truth, and in the past have even fact-checked blatant satirical articles written by the Daily Squib. What kind of fucking morons fact check satire, comedy or humour?
Still, it is heartening to see such a wide array of work on Feedspot. There are satire sites now even catering to the angry feminist agenda, so-called ‘satire’ sites for the woke and satire sites for nutjob Christian evangelists like the Babylon Bee. The woke will of course receive high rates of care from the likes of monopoly search engines who love anything that is watered down, soulless and empty.
The Squib, which does not adhere to any rules per se, somehow exists within this soup of inequity, we write what the fuck we want and if anyone does not like that, they can fuck off back to their safe space to suck on their dadmum’s non-milky non-binary hairy nipple.
Writing  Juvenalian true satire  or any form of commentary in these days of heavy Orwellian censorship and puritanical woke hypersensitivity is frankly a thankless job. Having to monitor and read news media for 24 hours a day is a terrible punishment, but it is our duty. We get little or no monetary compensation, we have no support from any conglomerate or anyone for that matter. Daily we are punished by the monopoly controllers of the search, and we are vilified as monsters by the social media Big Tech controllers who shadow-ban our profiles. Our brand of Juvenalian satire is today viewed as a crime simply because it reveals the bare truth of any given situation. The old adage, in a time of great deceit, telling the truth is a crime punishable by cancellation in an insidious putrid horrid world of cancel-culture and lies certainly applies.
Our only muse and allegiance lies in that of the satirical gods, and of course that certain Roman fellow 2,500 odd years ago —  Decimus Junius Juvenalis.

Review of Canadian Comic Zoe Brownstone’s Album ‘Dearly Deported’,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46698-review-of-canadian-comic-zoe-brownstones-album-dearly-deported.html,2022,"In  her debut comedy album  Dearly Deported  Toronto born comic Zoe Brownstone introduces herself as a slightly confused but bravely optimistic individual. With an opener that leaves nothing to the imagination about her opinions on living in The Netherlands to her dedication to becoming a well-balanced adult aged stoner, we meet someone who is really seeming to look like she is trying her best to figure it out.
With her quick jabs and timely wit, Zoe brings us along on the journey that brought her to Amsterdam, part cautionary tale, part satirical memoir; we can’t help but laugh at her and feel sorry for her all at the same time. Specifically when detailing the trials of becoming a stepmother and an untimely break-up. But within the series of unfortunate events, Zoe still serves confidence right alongside her questionable choices, a bravado that seemingly comes from nowhere and may not be deserved yet nevertheless is present throughout.
Here is someone we want to win, in Zoe it’s easy to identify pieces of ourselves as she gives us vulnerability for a period long enough to surprise the audience when she delivers a punchline. It’s an indication of her years as a comic on the Toronto scene and more recently helping to grow the English comedy scene in Holland. While this is her debut album, it’s clear she is not new to the craft.
In her material about cannabis use, we get to see a different archetype of the classic ‘stoner’ in the post-prohibition era of her home country. What the new-age stoner thinks about and her relationship to the often naturally anxiety inducing world we live in is insightful to even someone who does not partake. Universal themes of paranoia and self consciousness but in a twisted setting we can both laugh at in the moment and think back to later on (maybe while taking a puff).
This album is raw and fresh, giving us a look at an emerging comic finding her footing. We’re left at the end wondering what’s coming next for Zoe, and somehow having hope because if she can climb out of the (hilarious) hole she’s dug herself then surely we all can.",Entertainment

Apologies to Sam Raimi, but since the dawn of CGI, he might as well not attempt to direct any form of film ever again. Just let the AI and whacky, fake-looking CGI do it.

Turdy the Magnificent Piece of Shit has nearly 900,000 follows on Instagram, with fans obsessing over the unparalleled piece of excrement.
But it’s far from its toilet years, according to Turdy’s account owner.
The six-year-old turd from Burnley, England, has become an internet sensation after its owner started sharing pictures and videos of it online.
Turdy the Magnificent Piece of Shit has nearly 900,000 follows on Instagram. Fans have become obsessed with its fluffy, squishy consistency of shit.
“Nothing makes this piece of shit more confident than being photographed for Instagram,” said the Twitter account WeRateShits, awarding Turdy a 13 out of 10 score.
Turdy’s owner, Nigel, said: “Turdy has more personality and is more mature than most people on Instagram.”
“I don’t know why it’s so popular, maybe because the fake plastic shallow soulless world of Instagram and social networks is so banal and awful that a piece of shit can receive so many followers.”
Turdy’s most popular post has almost 600,000 likes and hundreds of comments praising its unique look.
‘I saw a video of it sitting there for 9 hours. During the seventh hour, a blue bottle fly, lovingly called  Calliphora vomitoria , landed on it. I actually screamed out aloud in excitement,’ said one fan.

London Palladium: The Steve Vai Report,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46103-london-palladium-the-steve-vai-report.html,2022,"To  receive the mere honour of being in the presence of a musician as esteemed as Steve Vai, if only for a few moments of virtuosity, is indeed a treat for anyone who appreciates the finer things in life. One has to be a connoisseur of the meandering ethereal Lydian scales and fantastical chord progressions that emit a cryptic esoteric, almost occult feel to the proceeding onslaught through your very being.
This is not a  concert  but a shamanic cleansing and Steve Vai is soaking the audience in healing and awakening forces that enlighten.
If you have not heard of Steve Vai before reading this, then you have something seriously missing from your fucking soul, so you better get learning. Steve is no looper, DJ, or autotune monkey. He is a real fucking musician, a virtuoso who knows every scale, chord and mode ever discovered on the devil’s instrument, and he is also inventing new things as he goes along. Those little intonations, triple quadruple tapping and whammy bar embellishments are also part of the arsenal he utilises to, of course, show off his showmanship. Whilst the current music charts are full of talentless shit and banal template mediocrity, real musicians like Vai continue to serve those audiences who appreciate musicality, melody and true dedication to the art of music.
Where 49 meets 61 somewhere in Clarksdale, Mississippi is where Robert Johnson is said to have been given the gift of fretboard knowledge, and it is almost a certainty that Steve Vai was given the same Mephistophelian gift somewhere. During the concert, the screen even shows off scenes from the 1986 film  Crossroads  in which Vai’s character, a minion of Papa Legba falls foul of the Karate Kid, but that’s all fiction. In reality, Vai may be 62, but he is still reaching musical plateaus to challenge himself and indeed his myriad of listeners.
The endearing part of Vai’s compositional sense is to move from one place to the next with seamless ease, from a quiet moment to sudden torrents of blazing Zappatastic arpeggios bringing forth the vast array of effects pedals and racks of vintage/modern processing available to him.
If you ever get a chance to see Steve Vai in concert, brace yourself for an assault on your ears — a good assault.",Entertainment

‘Compassionate’ Meghan Markle Ignores Her Dying Father in Hospital,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45974-compassionate-meghan-markle-ignores-her-dying-father-in-hospital.html,2022,"One would think, if you constantly virtue signal to the press and public about your ‘compassionate’ nature, that you would at least show some of that same fake compassion to your own father in hospital suffering after a stroke.
Naturally, the real emotion of compassion does not apply to Meghan Markle and the staunch shunning of her own father, Thomas Markle is the shameful result.
Psychologist Johann Brandt reveals an analysis of Meghan Markle’s ‘compassion’: “It is immediately evident that Meghan Markle is not a compassionate person, but is instead a person who pretends to be compassionate to increase her narcissistic standing. Psychopathy comes in many forms, and Meghan is an analytical hard-edged celebrity fame machine who deliberately married a royal purely to increase her celebrity status and power. Psychopath’s cannot feel real feelings like other humans, they can only mimic emotion. As Meghan mimics her fake love for Harry, who she is using, she also is attempting to  copy Princess Diana  and her charitable endeavours during her life. Meghan used her father to get ahead in show business and once she used him up and reached her pinnacle with Prince Harry she dumped her own father. This is another psychopathic trait, where people are used and believe they are being loved by the psychopath, but when the psychopath has used up all of the mark’s resources they move on to the next mark without even a whisper. There is no feeling and remorse and after countless people are used up by this narcissistic schizoid psychopath she moves from one person to the next seamlessly. She dares not revisit her dying father in hospital because of one single reason, she cannot feel real compassion and this problem would reveal her real character: a cold, heartless, narcissistic, power mad psychopath.”
Meghan Markle’s father is currently in a hospital, only two and a half hours drive from Meghan’s Montecito mansion. In Meghan’s dark callous mind, the hospital is a million miles away, or simply does not exist.
The treatment of her own father is definite proof that Meghan Markle does not feel compassion for him or any other global cause she claims to champion.",Entertainment

Not known for his  intelligence quota high scores , West is also blessed with numerous afflictions of the brain, probably schizophrenia mixed in with bipolarity, unjustified delusions of grandeur, manic depression and narcissistic  schizoid psychosis, but that’s neither here nor there. When you add antisemitism into the mix it gets very messy.

“This is celebrity suicide. You know like suicide by cop, but this time by Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. No one can hire this guy again. His career is over,” a record executive remarked on Sunday.
But is this blatantly racist idiot’s career really over?
Because Kanye is part of a protected race where they can say anything they want without any repercussion, commit any heinous crime without prosecution, and are continuously parachuted into jobs they are not even qualified for, it is a certainty that nothing will happen to Kanye.
Despite the fact, like other hateful anti-semites like former Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Kanye is normalising the hatred of Jews. Corbyn was white, so he eventually lost his job, but Kanye is black and is protected by the Liberal elites who run all media.",Entertainment

Katja Lameure, a Manufacturing Technology teacher at Burnsville Nippoleon High School in Ontario, who began transitioning a year ago, has gone viral  online  after students took photos and videos of the teacher trying to milk his gargantuan fake rubber breasts.
Weapons of Mass Distraction
One shocked student revealed how during lunchtime, the milk in the canteen ran out. This is when the teacher jumped up, took out one of his fake breasts and tried to milk it over a jug.
“He took out one of those things, and it had a huge fake rubber nipple on it. There were even blue veins painted on the breast, and a considerable amount of thick hairs protruding from the purple nipple. We all just stood there with our mouths open as this dude squeezed with all his might to milk that thing. He even started slapping it around the table and grunting wildly,” the student revealed.
Some students who attend the school have had to receive counselling after the shocking incident.
Naturally, the school board and staff rallied behind Lameure’s huge synthetic breasts being worn amongst children.
“We strive to promote a positive learning environment in schools consistent with values to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all students, staff and the community, regardless of race, age, ability, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, cultural observance, socioeconomic circumstances or gargantuan motherfucker sized ginormous fake rubber titties that defy all known laws of physics.”",Entertainment
Kanye West Would Not Exist if Hitler Won WW2,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/48573-kanye-west-would-not-exist-if-hitler-won-ww2.html,2022,"“Kanye West is a very confused, mentally deficient, disturbed individual who may idolise Adolf Hitler and the Nazis due partly to his hatred of Jewish people, but his own ignorance about history is also a factor to look at. The fact is, if Hitler and the Axis won in WW2, the eugenics programs would have sterilised all non-Aryan races across the globe. Kanye West would thus not exist because his ancestors would have either been gassed or sterilised. The negroid race was deemed as inferior and animalistic by the Nazis,” an Auschwitz survivor commented recently.
Ideally, Hitler’s beloved National Socialist Party would have expanded the concentration camp death system globally if the Nazis had won the war against the Allies. Eugenics and mass sterilisation programs are expensive and time intensive endeavours, especially when rolled out globally. The Nazis would probably have opted for a faster more efficient manner of cleansing via the expansion of the death camp system to quickly dispatch billions of so-called Untermenschen (sub-human races). Who is to say, from the 1950s onwards, the Germans would not develop far more efficient mass killing methods than the crude Zyklon-B gas chambers?
All other non-Aryan races are seen by fascist Nazis as genetic pollutants to be eradicated with extreme prejudice. Out of all races, the Nazis had scales, and the race that Kanye West belongs to is the bottom of the rung. Hitler’s Nazis feared the purity of the Aryan race being infected by the “throwback” African gene more so than of even Jewish blood. One can thus imagine death camps working day and night in the African continent for decades after the war until Hitler’s dream could be realised. Dr Mengele would be having a wonderful time as usual.
Ignorant, uneducated rappers with poor vocabulary and knowledge are still given a voice to spread their stupid ignorant thoughts. Why is that?
Well, the answer is quite simple really, West’s handlers, Jewish or not, have washed their hands of him and are now allowing him free rein to dig his own grave with his schizoid psychosis. If Kanye West had any dignity or intelligence, he would not be in the situation he is in now.
If Hitler had won the war, he would have neutralised Kanye West’s negroid ancestors and he would not exist today. How do you like your idol now Kanye?",Entertainment

This sickening vomitus couple are vile self-pitying morose creatures who are basically monetising past power plays and so-called ‘injustices’ that are in the scheme of things fucking trivial.
Netflix claims in the series that members of the royal family were approached for comment, but the royal palace has disputed that any member of the royal family was ever approached by the exploitative show. Therefore, the Netflix Meghan and Harry series starts off with a blatant lie, as it peddles its inane trivial self-pitying cowardly moan-fest.
The royal family have thus been cursed and will rue the day they ever allowed this nefarious viper into the fold. Meghan Markle, a despicable suppurating woke anal wart stalking the royal family with vicious lies, is clearly out to completely destroy their reputation and has even labelled the entire British population as racist.
This is about ego, narcissism and exploiting the memory of Princess Diana for money. Harry should hold his head in abject shame for besmirching the memory of his own mother by monetising her death via a tabloid exploitative reality show like Netflix.

5 Tips to Avoid the Horrendous Holiday Season Travel Chaos,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/46021-5-tips-to-avoid-the-horrendous-holiday-season-travel-chaos.html,2022,"Spending eight hours waiting for your flight amongst thousands of angry, rowdy and smelly  travellers ? The check-in queue extends for miles, with fights breaking out and young children screaming constantly. Once you are finally on the plane, the captain comes on the tannoy and says there will be another eight-hour wait because a screw fell off the hydraulic capacitor. The insanity of modern-day travel chaos makes you wish you had never ventured out your door this morning. There are five-hour waits for your hired car. No one has any information as you are told your flight has now been cancelled after waiting for another nine hours in hope…etc…
You can avoid the utter nightmare of travel chaos and aggravation with only a few tips that will ensure you and your family have an amazing care free holiday.
1. Hire or own a private jet. This way, you will never have to travel with the unclean masses ever again. To do this, you will need to at least have a minimum of a few million or a billion in your bank account and be making millions/billions of pounds per annum. You will be able to fly to the most exclusive holiday spots in the world and enjoy first class service all the way. You will never be stuck in an airport or even have to speak to another bothered holidaymaker ever again.
2. Do not go on holiday abroad and save not only your money but your sanity as well as your dignity. Being stuck in a rain-soaked Welsh field in a tent listening to the torrential rain coming down whilst chomping down on some awful ready-made meal is far more preferable to any extended airport mayhem.
3. Do not go on holiday at all. This is possibly the best advice to give anyone who is thinking of travelling at the same time as all the other rats who want to go on holiday. Why would you do this to yourself in the first place, make your children suffer the indignity of waiting for days on end in some overcrowded soulless airport and treated like absolute shit by the overworked understaffed airport staff? Do not go on holiday.
4. Yes, go on holiday, but wait for the time when everyone is back at work and school. This way you will obviously avoid the needless exercise of being part of the dirty masses. Just pull a massive sicky at work, say you have Covid and Monkeypox at the same time or something like that.
5. Earn shitloads of money, so much so that you will never have to work again and basically move to a beach somewhere in the world on permanent holiday. If you can manage this feat before the age of 30 at least you can enjoy some healthy days of fun.
6. (BONUS) Become unemployed. No hard work is involved with this one, and you don’t have to ever work for the rest of your life. If that is not a holiday, what is?",Entertainment

“The bouncy castle will be set up directly on the steps of Westminster Abbey and photographers will be called to take photographs of young Archie jumping around in it. There will be some dodgy geezers from a fairground assisting and some old speakers playing garage music at high volume. The Sussexes have even hired a DJ from Cricklewood to play the awful tunes. The prince thinks this stunt will raise his and his wife’s poor profile,” a PR agent in London revealed.
Westminster Council were contacted by the Sussexes and a proposal was presented to officials last week.
If this goes ahead, it could derail the entire Charles Coronation and even cause a health and safety nightmare.

Grammys: Apparently Satan is a Little Fat Bloke in a Onesie,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/49341-grammys-apparently-satan-is-a-little-fat-bloke-in-a-onesie.html,2023,"The good old Christian creation of Satan used to be a mysterious strong enigmatic figure, yes red was his colour and flames roasted the souls around him for eternity. In 2023, things have changed somewhat, and we have a fat bloke in a red onesie prancing around a Grammys stage with a German eunuch back-up singer in a cage.
The controllers and marketeers of this music biz extravaganza want the outrage, so that people talk about their product. Clearly, by adding the faux satanic element they are specifically targeting the Christians in the audience, so their outrage can move their bland soulless product in the mediocre music charts. Sure, outrage creates a selling point, but it does have its limits. However much one polishes a turd, at the end of the day it is still a turd. One suspects that even devout Christians would watch this pathetic nonsense of some fat bloke poncing around in a onesie and a Halloween set of horns and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, because even they can see through it all.
Poor old Christians are an easy target because they are so forgiving, and many have since lost the lustre of the initial childhood mind implantation. If these marketeers wanted real controversy, they would ridicule Islam or the Prophet. It is a given that doing such things usually results in an early death, so maybe they are not as stupid as they act. If you want to live, that’s one religion no one apart from the recklessly insane fuck with.
There was a time once when illiterate dumb humans could be made to believe in the devils and the gods, so they could think there was an omnipresent moralistic force judging them over their worldly deeds and constantly watching over their every move. Nowadays, we just have  Google/NSA  doing the constant watching and judging.
These man-made religions were constructed to create Ordo ab Chao, Order out of Chaos. Christianity, specifically, was created to replace the end of the Roman Empire, the great Caesars and Roman Gods/Goddesses replaced by the Holy Trinity and a cross — a much simpler and easier control system. By amalgamating past religious memes, they created an ideal superhuman called Jesus, a perfect being modelled on Osiris. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, created 4,500 BC before the Bible described the great flood in great detail, and was subsequently copied by the blokes who concocted the Bible later on, much to the embarrassment of Victorian Christians. The point being that all of these entities, characters and mythical occurrences are all essentially created by human minds — including the Christian version of Satan.
In 2012, 40 million people tuned in to watch the Grammys, and in 2023, it was a mere 18.7 million. It seems the more woke and deranged the media controllers get, the fewer people watch, therefore resulting in resorting to scraping the barrel with douchebags like fat Satan haunting the show — a festering suppurating anal wart on the ass of humanity.
Next year at the Grammys, maybe we can have more laughable, impotent attempts to create a modicum of outrage to push viewing figures even fucking lower. Do What Thou Wilt is a phrase the morons who market this pathetic, banal pap will never understand or put into real practice.",Entertainment

Suspected cocaine found in White House’s West Wing under investigation
“I was on the way to Vegas for another orgy, and I was coordinating with over a dozen girls on my cell phone whilst swerving insanely through traffic at 170-190 mph, taking hits off my crack pipe and getting blown by three girls at the same time.
Time is money
“I want to talk about my multitasking skills, and how you too can manage many wonderful tasks at the same time.
“First thing you gotta do is light up your crack pipe. It’s the first and last thing I do in any day. Crack is great stuff, man, it can make you do superhuman things that no sober person can do. Sure, my teeth eventually rotted away, but I got new porcelain ones the next fuckin’ day.
“This won’t work with everyone but exceeding the speed limit is a privilege that I can do, and you can’t. Do you have connections like I do? Exactly. Shit, I can shoot people on a street right there, bam, dead, and get away with it. I am above the law. I don’t even have to pay frickin’ taxes for all the ill-gotten gains me and the Big Guy got, allegedly.
“Anyway, check this out folks, the cops stopped me and I puffed some crack smoke right in the officer’s eyes as he asked me how fast I was travelling. I just told him, do you know who my dad is? I could have you doing traffic citations in fuckin’ Alaska by next week. Well, he rolled his eyes and let me go. It’s great to be the son of a corrupt politician who has to answer to no one and can get away with any blatant crime they commit. In fact, it makes me get hard just at the thought of it, scuse me, I gotta take another hit. *schtoooom*
Multitasking skills
“There’s room for everyone in my Porsche, and the three ladies I had that day were on lollipop duty. Like you take one long toke of the pipe, and they take three licks of the other long pipe, you know what I’m saying? The trick is not to release too fast, you gotta let it all linger for as long as possible, the pleasure mounts, it escalates, then you take another sip of the crack pipe, and it propels the pleasure forward keeping you right on the edge of releasing your goodies all over their eager faces. Damn, if I relinquish, I gotta have a line-up of girls with their faces anticipating the reward for their dear service to the USA. You know like eager pets ready for their daily snack, kibbles and shit, and then boom, I give one hottie a taste, then move along the line, you know it’s a fuckin’ production line these gals are workin’ on. You gotta time it right, all of them gotta have their tongues outstretched too. You want eye contact as well, that actually doubles or triples the pleasure, and then ‘boom’ the force of it. I am god right there and then, I can fuckin’ do anything, I am untouchable, even the FBI, CIA, and DEA cannot touch me. I am a superstar at that moment, drink it up baby, lap it up, you’re my little doggy.
“But it’s not all highs, folks, when you put the pipe down, sure there are lows, but that’s life huh you can’t be high all the time. So, you have to manage those times when you don’t have a crack pipe in your mouth, or are dealing with some CCP affiliated company making dodgy deals by using your dad’s position in government. When I make illegal money and don’t pay tax, that in itself makes me high. The IRS will be told to stand down, because pops weaponised all these agencies for his own purposes. He uses these government agencies to harass and ruin the political opposition and to win elections. You will see how it works in 2024, just like that chump Trump is getting hammered by pops daily, while we get away with everything. It’s so beautiful, I just gotta little pre-juice drippin’ down. Open up baby, yes, lap up the head off that.
“Hope you all enjoyed my tips and tricks, folks? Remember next time you are bombing down the highway at 172 MPH smoking a shitload of crack and getting blown by three underage Russian ladies of the night, unless you are Hunter Biden, you ain’t gonna get away with it.

Bonkers Prince Harry Now Thinks He is an Egyptian Pharaoh,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/52547-bonkers-prince-harry-now-thinks-he-is-an-egyptian-pharaoh.html,2023,"Bonkers Prince Harry thinks he is now an Egyptian Pharaoh and wants to be mummified in his own pyramid in Las Vegas alongside Meghan when he dies, his spokesperson Ovid Scooby has revealed to the BBC.
“Harry daily consults a reincarnated Egyptian priestess from Fresno called Amy Schmucker. She looked into her magical crystal ball and saw that Harry is actually the reincarnation of Amenhotep IV, who ruled Egypt during the period of the New Kingdom from 1351 to 1334 BC. He told me that the priestess said some funny words and immediately Harry was struck by this feeling that he really truly was a pharaoh and that he needed to make haste in his mission to build a pyramid as a final resting place, because pyramids take a long time to build and need many workers to push rocks around, or something like that. This means Harry is now more important than King Charles and all the British royal family combined.”
Initially, Harry consulted the Montecito city council on his plans to build a pyramid about 455 feet tall consisting of 2.3 million blocks of limestone. Each block would weigh around 2.5 tons (2267.96 kilograms). So 2,300,000 x 2267.96 = 5,216,308,000 kilograms (5,750,000 tons) of material would be required.
Unfortunately for Harry, Montecito town councillors told the ‘pharaoh’ that he cannot build a structure like that in the protected area, so now he has gone to Las Vegas where there is a pyramid already, and a possibility for another one to be built.
Meghan Markle was also told that she was the reincarnation of Queen Cleopatra, and immediately called Jadajada Pinky Smithers, who congratulated her on her new-found status as Queen of Africa.
“The couple daily invite many Californian psychics into their home, and Meghan Markle once invited a voodoo priestess from Haiti so that she can cast a horrid spell on Camilla. Yes, they are very open-minded progressive people, and should be applauded for their wonderful sense of energy,” Scooby added.",Entertainment

“As a champagne socialist and bleeding heart liberal slash Marxist, I actually enjoyed being stabbed multiple times. I usually virtue-signal at any opportunity, and this was a good time to champion the thug who plunged the zombie knife deep into my intestines and liver. I was revelling in the meaningful ‘inclusive’ cultural exchange as copious amounts of my blood spurted out of the stab wounds.”
Mr. Smith added that he was totally in tune with the poverty and debasement of the Jamaican born individual who butchered him.
“It’s not their fault, many cannot even read or write. I totally blame the Tory education systems because they do not take these people by the hand and give them things for doing nothing, they expect pupils to actually make an effort. At one point, my liver was hanging out of the stab wound, so I calmly pushed it back in so that no one would trip on it. After the stabbing stopped, I thanked the man for coming to our country and integrating into British culture. He then stabbed me in the groin for good measure. I thanked him for that as well.”
Mr. Smith is lucky to be alive, and will never walk again. His wounds were so severe that he will have to use a catheter to urinate for the rest of his life because his genitals were severed from his body. Despite this set back, Mr. Smith praised his attacker.
“If we were living in a  socialist Labour utopia  where money somehow grows on trees, and everyone is magically equal and happy, this young man would not be so angry. I really see his point because people tell him he has to work for a living and study for a good education, but because he can’t be bothered to work or study and is into drug dealing and part of a gang of murderous thugs he only knows violence as a way of communication. I have petitioned the council to give him more benefits, so he can buy more drugs and continue just being who he is. It’s not his fault, *cough* it….is….eurgh!”
At that point, unfortunately, Mr. Smith suffered from multiple organ failure and died gurgling about how great socialism and wokism is for society.

Well, it seems standards do not matter to the little girlies getting their mummies and daddies to pay through the nose to furnish the already brimming bank account of pop starlet Taylor Swift jetting around the world in private jets to hold fake concerts.
What is touted as live music these days for the pop crowd is not actually live but intricately designed concert shows where previously recorded autotune and AI material is mimed to onstage, fooling their dedicated fans. Of course, the backing tracks are shut off and the microphone feed enabled when the pop mime artiste says a few words to the audience between songs to keep up the pretence.
Just about “the look”
Record companies deploy backing tracks for pop acts because the gay dance moves involved in pop concerts are quite arduous for their acts, and many have no vocal talent without studio trickery.
“Female pop mime artiste Taylor Swift for example has many costume changes and dance moves. She changes her costumes as often as  she changes her men . This is more of a visual event, and the music is an afterthought, not our primary concern. The backing tracks are studio quality recordings that enhance the experience for the dumbed down audiences. The fucking idiots who follow this particular act are not conversant on what constitutes real music or live music, therefore they can easily be fooled. They’re just happy to pay hundreds of dollars or pounds to see their squeaking pop idol miming along and fooling thousands of screaming little girlies,” one of the recording executives involved with numerous pop mime acts revealed before driving off in his Maserati.",Entertainment

His latest interpretation of what would possibly be a Civil War scenario in America is somewhat of a dry and sparse minimalist interpretation of something that could have potentially been an epic film, but falls short in many ways.
If one considers that the USA has a population today in excess of 333 million people, one wonders where the hell they all went during the civil war? We get to see the odd skirmish between a few people, and the highly improbable ending is truly laughable. During any event of civil unrest or especially a war, the President of the United States would not be in the Oval Office, he would either be in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC), a bunker-like structure underneath the East Wing of the White House or a bunker very far away from the White House or up in the air in a Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post (AACP), “Nightwatch” aircraft, which is a strategic command and control military aircraft for extreme doomsday scenarios. Furthermore, the president would not be left practically unguarded with four or five SS men with handguns in the White House, as is portrayed in the film.
There is some play with contrast during the film with times of quiet and calm suddenly contrasted with noisy gun play, but apart from a few moments of combat, be prepared for more focus on an ultimately boring team of photographic journalists making their way across the deserted country in an SUV.
Although Garland’s works are usually enjoyable pieces, Civil War is not only highly improbable, but it makes a US Civil War seem like a gentle stroll in the park. Throughout history, there has never been a pleasant civil war fought, but this one seems like a pleasant, peaceful affair where the only thing missing are the tea and scones. If every civil war was like this, nations should have them more often.
One area that is captured rather realistically is the cold nature of the Press, and their constant pursuit for that perfect story or photograph.
If there really was a civil war in America, one would have to consider that 32% of citizens has a firearm or multiple firearms.
About   four-in-ten U.S. adults say they live in a household with a gun, including 32% who say they personally own one,  according to a report filed by Pew Research.
There are differences in gun ownership rates by political affiliation, gender, community type and other factors.
32% of 333 million = 106,560,000 citizens with  firearms , plus add the US military into the mix and a US Civil War would be able to be seen from the fucking I.S.S. up in orbit. Imagine the gangs, the militias, the factions, the US Army, the lone families, and everyone all shooting at each other — you would be able to see the fricking fireworks from the moon.
The power vacuum, the looting, the polarised nature of the population, and all the  other variables  would all melt into a single bucket of extreme violence and insane levels of gun play practically in every state.
As already mentioned before, Civil War the film does not in any way address any of these issues, and portrays the entire event as some kind of lazy pleasant road trip movie, albeit with a few interspersed moments of minimal war, one could describe it as mild skirmishes.
This is definitely not a Civil War — some people have probably witnessed more combat in a  Waffle House  at 3.30 AM.

Prince Harry Set to Star as Worzel Gummidge in Hollywood Epic,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55483-prince-harry-set-to-star-as-worzel-gummidge-in-hollywood-epic.html,2024,"Netflix has commissioned a new series featuring Prince Harry who will star as a scarecrow called Worzel Gummidge, based on the 1970s original children’s series. According to network insiders, the lucrative deal has already been signed, and Harry is very excited at being chosen for the role.
At a recent Hollywood meet up, the errant prince was ecstatic about the role.
“I’m a scarecrow, see, and I have many different heads. One head is me thinking head, but I lose that one a lot, you know. I particularly like me dumbo head, it suits me fine. All that clever stuff is way above my normal head. Like, I was told by that man over theres, I woulds be paid with two bales of straw, a few twigs, and a big filthy hat with a crusty cow-pat on it for the role. How could I resist?”
Unfortunately for the prince, if Trump wins the upcoming election, Harry might have to put on his exile head, because he could be deported for lying about his  past drug use  on his visa application. Oops.
The Netflix remake of Worzel Gummidge starring Harry is set to air in August.",Entertainment
RITA BOOKE: Why Young Gen Z Fans Like Me Are Swooning Over the Daily Squib Anthology?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/58315-rita-booke-why-young-gen-z-fans-like-me-are-swooning-over-the-daily-squib-anthology.html,2024,"Since we flew the nest, my older brother Alex and I have been eyeing the Daily Squib Anthology on the  publisher’s website . Recently, our parents said if we wanted a copy, we could take a few each; we have been fighting like toddlers ever since.
So now she’s threatening to buy even more copies – including a  Daily Squib t-shirt  – written into her will. She won’t say whether she’s joking or not.
Why the fierce rivalry? For us 20-somethings, the fantastic, biting satire in the DS Anthology is the ultimate status symbol.
I’ve always been obsessed – when I was a tot, Mum would unleash me in WHsmith’s like a truffle pig so adept was I at spotting the book on the shelf – and now it’s taken over TikTok, with influencers posting their #DailySquib hauls and screaming manically over any new collections.
At the weekend, social media was filled with videos of six-hour queues outside the book’s publisher sale in Crambospavvy, Norfolk. Exhausted influencers jostled for the Daily Squib Anthology and gleefully claimed it was ‘worth it’, as police herded the middle-class hordes outside.
It wasn’t just the middle-aged elbowing their way to the front. For my image-obsessed generation, there’s nothing like haemorrhaging £17.95 on a satire anthology. It’s the definition of ‘quiet luxury’. Those in the know can spot its unfussy but distinct aesthetic.
The Daily Squib’s homogenous book design means you only need to choose the book. It’s an easy way to say ‘I have taste’ without actually needing to have any. I once agreed to a date just because he handed me a drink in a  Daily Squib mug  at a house party. I barely noticed his face.
If you’re properly middle-class, you inherit your Daily Squib Anthology, but you can easily rectify this by loading up on your own. This kind of social mobility can be bought at  Curtis Press . But real fans look for second-hand pieces; with slightly battered edges, you can feign generational wealth and class.
The quality of the Daily Squib Anthology is seductive, too. Its classic, black and white books stand the test of time, and the satire transcends any form of wokeness or socialist tantrums after losing elections to Trump.
With the zeitgeist turning away from wokeness in all its forms, investing in something practical but beautiful feels more justifiable than buying another shitty woke book written by some BBC or MSNBC  celebriturd .
None of us can afford houses, after all, so why not cheer up our flat shares by spending any deposit money on an anti-woke Juvenalian satire anthology?
So, I can’t say I’m surprised at all those hopefuls queuing up at the publisher’s warehouse. I just can’t believe I missed it.",Entertainment

The Sussexes Rebrand by Harry and Meghan a Genius Move,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54825-the-sussexes-rebrand-by-harry-and-meghan-a-genius-move.html,2024,"The Windsors are now viewed as weak, cancer ridden and from a bygone era; the Sussexes on the other hand are now viewed as strong, defiant and youthful.
The reason that Harry immediately rushed to see King Charles when he announced he had cancer was one example of how the Sussexes utilise their PR power. Immediately, the focus was on Harry returning to the UK by the press, it was not on poor old Charles who has a horrid illness. It is this shift in press attention the new Sussexes crave and utilise to great effect to damage their enemies further.
Most royal lineages would have immediately taken away the titles of non-working grifters like Harry and Meghan but in the case of King Charles, a very weak individual who does not like to confront problems head on, instead choosing to be the target of a barrage of constant attack by the Sussexes, the Windsors have now suffered another bitter blow.
The attacks on the weak Windsors will continue from now on, simply because with every attack, there is little or no response and they are easy targets. Furthermore, each PR attack or theft of limelight action is a victory for the Sussexes. Royal houses must act when attacked, even when the attacks are from within, and if they do not act swiftly, and decisively they are doomed.
The pallid impotence of King Charles III is an obvious hindrance to the monarchy, and if this were 400 years ago, it is most certain his reign would have been very short-lived. It is lucky for him that we live in times of relative peace.
The late Queen Elizabeth II knew towards the end that Harry and Meghan were no friends, and consequently their actions sped her to the grave. It is now possible that the same will happen to poor old King Charles — unless he acts NOW.",Entertainment

“The Rack” Makes a Comeback Thanks to the Snap-Happy Instagram Generation,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55332-the-rack-makes-a-comeback-thanks-to-the-snap-happy-instagram-generation.html,2024,"Once considered a relic of medieval brutality, the infamous torture device known as “The Rack” is experiencing a revival among the Instagram generation, sparking a macabre fascination with historical torment and extracting confessions from people.
Perceived as a bygone quirk of old-fashioned British quaintness, “The Rack” was a formidable instrument of torture employed for hundreds of years in the castles and dungeons of Britain and Europe.
Restaurants, cafés, and even some hotels are witnessing a surge in interest, with bookings for “Rack experiences” on the rise. Sales of themed torture hampers, complete with implements of agony, are skyrocketing.
A recent survey conducted by the historical torture equipment emporium Torture-Masters Ltd. revealed that out of 2,000 individuals aged 25-34, a staggering 43 percent had commemorated special occasions with a session on “The Rack.”
Supermarkets have reported a 600 percent increase in searches for information about “The Rack,” while sales of torture-themed hampers have seen an 80 percent year-on-year increase.
Experts in medieval torture techniques attribute this resurgence to the allure of capturing such experiences for social media, with themes such as “Medieval Madness” and “Torture Time Travel” proving particularly photogenic.
Sarah Smith, head of product development at TortureCo, remarked, “Customers view ‘The Rack’ not merely as a historical artifact but as an opportunity to share a unique moment of suffering posted for the Instagram generation.”
Instagram influencer, Rupert Nymans, 23, took numerous selfies whilst being stretched on ‘The Rack’ and as a result he racked up 50,000 likes and 20,000 subs.
“Not only that, but I used to be 4″8, and now I’m 6″4. I actually managed to get a date with a girl after many years of trying. Although extremely painful, the overall experience has been great. Can’t wait to try out the “Iron Maiden” for my next Instagram shoot.”
Ben Barnes, founder of Torture Treats, which operates torture-themed cafés at historical sites, added, “The sight of stretched limbs, agonised expressions, and a celebratory toast to pain make for compelling Instagram content that gets some serious likes.”
The Royal Family has also played a role in bringing this ancient tradition back into the spotlight. Following a televised event in June 2022 where the late Queen participated in a demonstration of “The Rack” with a historical reenactor, interest surged.
Barnes noted, “We observed a significant increase in inquiries for ‘Rack experiences’ during and after the Queen’s demonstration in 2022, as well as during King Charles’s coronation in 2023, attracting not only foreign tourists but also locals.”
As interest in “The Rack” resurges, there is a spirited debate about whether the torture implements need updating or if traditional methods should be preserved.
Purists argue for authenticity, citing historical accounts of agonising torture sessions. However, proponents of modernisation advocate for the inclusion of contemporary elements such as cocktails, cold cuts, and even hummus to enhance the overall torture experience, all consumed to the soundtrack of Agadoo by 80s pop band Black Lace.",Entertainment
US Civil War Predictive Programming?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/54260-us-civil-war-predictive-programming.html,2023,"There is no doubt that America is a severely polarised country, which has ramped up its divisions within the last few decades through the introduction of wokism and other Marxist ideologies. The left and right are now so far apart, something eventually will snap. The latest film by writer Alex Garland, who wrote and directed ’24 Days Later’, ‘Ex Machina’, introduces ‘A24’ in 2024. Predictive programming is a subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes to be implemented by our leaders. If and when these changes are put through, the public will already be familiarised with them and will accept them as natural progressions. Contrary to belief, this predictive technique is not a ‘conspiracy theory’ but an actual clandestine technique utilised by some intelligence agencies primarily in the 20th Century.
Unfortunately for most Americans, civil war and states seceding could become a reality very soon, purely on the concept of things like religion, race and politics.
Decades of  demoralisation  have seemed to have worked to a point where society and traditional American values have deteriorated to a point of no return. America’s enemies fed the country with woke ideology borne from Marxism and Soviet communism, which filtered into the entire breadth of American society, including the education systems and even the government. The Democratic Party abandoned liberalism for communism, with a more authoritarian censorious outlook that sought to completely cancel entire swathes of American society.
Wokism is a Marxist ideology that seeks to make Western capitalist culture self-destruct; to make  people hate their own culture , colour and sexuality. It seeks to re-write history in its favour, and to denigrate formerly great Western historic heroes and heroines, turning them into hate figures. What better weapon is there for an enemy to use against America than to fracture society, creating discord and animosity to its own culture? Woke agents embedded in all governmental and media departments are daily working to divide America, turning it into an even more hateful entity fighting itself from within. Woke ideology is unfortunately a soviet import from the Cold War which is being utilised by Russia, Iran and China against the once great USA. Wokism uses America’s sole biggest weakness against itself, exploiting this tension to benefit America’s enemies — race.
The internet is certainly also to blame for this level of demoralisation because on the internet America’s enemies can easily create dissent and chaos in social media forums, foreign hackers can infiltrate American databases and use that data against the American people and government. Big Tech has also fomented discord and pandered to the woke ideology, working to create woke echo chambers, skewing search results and cancelling any voices of opposition to woke ideology.
Of course America must be inclusive to some extent, but when that level of inclusion supports known internal terrorist groups like ANTIFA, and agitative racist groups like BLM, there is something very wrong going on in the country.
The film is called A24 and is possibly a form of predictive programming, foreseeing future developments.",Entertainment

Turning off the tap of wokism suddenly exposes these individuals to their own insanity and delusion, and this can cause some tears and an inevitable woke backlash.
Free ride’s over
Some woke institutions are now even changing the names of their DEI programs to Office of Collaboration to circumnavigate any Trump ruling. It may work, who knows? Is anyone monitoring this stuff?
Imagine being indoctrinated to think there are 2,459 genders when Trump comes along and says there are only two. How about the DEI officers tasked with creating intricate and inherently useless diversity and inclusion schemes costing millions of dollars, when they are told all funding just disappeared and they lost their made-up jobs? There goes your US taxpayer funded salary of $450,000 per year and your health benefits along with that huge pension they said they would pony up.

It is estimated that Tessica Brown’s IQ level is with all probability around the 38 level, and that’s being generous. Her IQ level is thus below someone with a major brain disorder or injury, and she is even below the level of major retardation.
Exhibit B – YouTuber Shot Dead After Confronting Stranger With Butcher Knives
Some people will do anything for YouTube views, don’t forget to click the fucking subscribe and notification button. Timothy Wilks, 20, was gunned down in the parking lot of Urban Air trampoline park in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday.
Wilks was filming a robbery prank for a YouTube channel at the time.
He is reported to have lunged at strangers with butcher’s knives, so he could record their terrified reactions.
This time, there was no ‘like’ button pressed, but a trigger pulled and a lead bullet entered his tiny cranium.
It is estimated that much like other YouTube ‘personalities’ Wilks’ IQ level was probably in the lower 50s. More borderline retardation, but the good news is he will not pass his genes on as he did not procreate.

Meghan Markle Endures Bird Shit Trauma During Oprah Interview,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41200-meghan-markle-endures-bird-shit-trauma-during-oprah-interview.html,2021,"During the sell-out Oprah interview, Meghan Markle was talking about her favourite subject – herself – when a cute little tweety boird landed on a branch next to the narcissist. The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle’s black couture dress.
They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry’s ratings in the UK.
One of Oprah’s producers was professional about the bird shit incident.
“The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!”
As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple’s garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient.

Experts: Meghan Markle Thought She Could Move Up Rank in Royal Family,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41634-experts-meghan-markle-thought-she-could-move-up-rank-in-royal-family.html,2021,"According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works.
“Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that’s it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point.
“This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums.
“Prince Harry once said ‘What Meghan wants Meghan gets’ and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry’s life by taking him away from the royal family to North America.
“Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle’s psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go.
“Markle has  modelled herself on Harry’s mother, Diana , and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the  Shanghai Technique ,  so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique.
“Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana’s inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work.
“Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves.
“As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan’s evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan’s titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.”",Entertainment

“When I spoke to Doprah I told the  whole truth  and nothing but the truth. My dad cut me off completely of financial aid when I left Britain. He was only paying my £5 million when I was used to receiving £10 million a month. That’s not good enough for me or Meghan, and she had a huge hissy fit over it. Meghan told me to shame papa on the Doprah show whilst we plied the show with more lies…ahem…I mean truths! Money grows on trees, right?”
Amongst the many lies and half-truths spilled on the Doprah interview, were the usual crap about Archie being denied princedom for some reason or rather, being married twice, and other petty grievances that people who do not receive vast sums of money for doing nothing could not comprehend.
What does prince Harry and Meghan do exactly apart from expel vast sums of carbon emissions every year with their extensive private jet travel itinerary and other emission busting nonsense? If living in an extensive 16-bathroom McMansion is not enough of an insult, what the fuck is?
Being the self-proclaimed saviours of the earth with their constant nonsensical lectures is obviously not enough.
What happened to their Spotify show that was meant to change global consciousness?
As for the awful saccharin puerile illiterate  book  written by Meghan, insider publisher knowledge reveals that the book was in fact purchased in its thousands by Meghan Markle’s team, so it would top the New York bestseller list. That’s the only way it could get to that level, simply because no sane person on the planet would buy that book if they possessed a single brain cell.
One has to feel awfully sorry for Harry though, he does not know whether he’s coming or going, he has a form of verbal diarrhoea with no plug in sight, much to the detriment of anyone exposed to the media, or the long-suffering royal family.
How much money was pumped into the life of Harry over the years, how much taxpayers cash was pissed away in Mahiki and places like Las Vegas?

The 700,000 brave souls within the United Kingdom should be praised for their fortitude in resisting against an unjust tax from a partisan biased institution that churns out mediocre content plus constant reruns that effectively solely serves the Woke Labour Party and the Corbynista Bolshevik revolutionary communist army as well as the EU.
The treatment of the  over-75s  by the BBC is a despicable statement of almost criminal neglect for those who have supported the channel for their entire lives.
The only positive action that has come from the BBC recently is the dumping of the limp leftist  Mash Report , a putrid pustule of rotting suppurating puss presented by some militant cunt with more than a few chips on his festering shoulders.
The BBC as it stands is a channel that only serves the Metropolitan champagne socialist set, even abandoning the British working class in favour of Wokism. Putting trigger warnings on classic shows like Blackadder, and pandering to the Woke agenda, is just another footstep into the grave.
More people need to boycott the BBC and its unjust licence, that pays the likes of Gary Lineker over £3.5 million of taxpayers money each year. Lineker only has to work once every two or three times a week for a 45-minute session to earn his grotesque fee.
The numbers refusing to pay the BBC licence must increase year-on-year. If you too are fed up with the BBC at its current condition, act now. Cancel your subscription, and you will feel a lot better for acting positively.

England Fan Filmed Snorting Cocaine Then Sticking a Flare Up His Arse Honoured at Madame Tussauds,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42965-england-fan-filmed-snorting-cocaine-then-sticking-a-flare-up-his-arse-honoured-at-madame-tussauds.html,2021,"An England fan videoed  sticking a flare up his own arsehole  and snorting cocaine before entering Wembley without a ticket last night proudly boasted ‘I’m not sorry, and I’d do it again tomorrow’.
Tradesman’s entrance
The England super fan will be honoured with a permanent exhibition at Madame Tussauds wax work museum to commemorate the courage and good behaviour of England fans during the Euro 2020 football tournament.
Jack Tokes, 22, a roofer from Essex, is said to have claimed he drank 43 cans of cheap cider and ‘banged a load of powder’ – slang for snorting cocaine – during a 15-hour bender on Sunday, when England took on Italy in the Euro 2020 final.
Director of the London-based wax work museum was so enamoured by videos posted all over the internet of Mr Tokes shoving a red live flare up his anus in public that he immediately brought the England fan into the museum’s studios to re-create the momentous moment.
“Visitors at Tussauds will see an exact wax representation of Jack Tokes sticking a flare up his arse whilst standing upright on his arms in a hand-stand position when they walk right through the doors of our London museum. We have even gone to the effort of making the red flare smoke gently, a red smoke, with audible sounds of other England fans whooping with excitement piped through speakers around the fantastic exhibit,” the director of Madame Tussauds, Mr. Conard Rumple, told the Evening Standard.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan was also wonderfully touched by the England fan’s enthusiasm, and is now putting through an order for the fan’s statue to be put on a plinth in Trafalgar Square.

SANNIOS’S STAR RISING IN THE FILM SCORING INDUSTRY,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/43909-sannioss-star-rising-in-the-film-scoring-industry.html,2021,"S ometimes, the most interesting and beautiful things in life happen unexpectedly! After all, we live in the digital era where we can connect easily with people from all around the world. A privilege that nowadays we take for granted, but people back in the 80s, 90s or even 00s never dreamed of.
Sannios has a fondness for what this digital social media era can offer and what has achieved for him.
He recalls: “During the first few months at Berklee College of Music, I was following 
and adding fellow musicians on my social media platforms. I was a newcomer in the USA and I wanted to make as many connections as possible. In my mind, it was a typical thing and the best that I was expecting was adding a couple of good friends, a good rehearsal, forming my band, discussions about the classes and music in general.
I am a very communicative personality and after my graduation my intention was to move to LA, so I wanted to start making connections there. It all started with a random 
question that I asked one of my friends.”
This random question would direct him to a series of events that led him to come in contact with many of the most accomplished musicians in LA.
“Delfi in my country Greece was regarded, by mythology, the “navel” (Omphalos) the centre of the world. Los Angeles is the “Delfi”, the “navel”, the centre of where the heart of music and film industry beats.’’
The story of John Sannios shows that everything is possible and that sometimes it only needs a starting point that can be just a question, or a discussion with a friend.
The new contact in LA was  Francois Blaignan , an award-winning sound designer and producer. He is also a Berklee College of Music Alumnus with distinctions and important projects in his portfolio.
He has worked on many nominated and awarded projects, such as the Academy Award-winning films “ The thin Red Line ” and “ The Last Days ”. He has worked on big multimedia projects like the “ Avengers Station ”. He has used Tinitus studios in LA for the needs of projects like “ Star Trek: First Contact ” (1996), “ Human Nature ” (2002) and many more.
While collaborating with Francois Blaignan on the sound of “ MyShake ” app in “ Tinitus ” he had the chance to meet the film and television composer Richard Friedman, well known in the performing arts for his dramatic and orchestral scores. His music has been licensed worldwide and used by directors and producers such as Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and many others.
“I was thrilled to get to know him because I always admired his work! We agreed that there is a number of projects where my involvement with the sound design, orchestration, music editing in combination with my personal audio plug-ins setup was very much needed.
Meanwhile, we worked on the film “ Mind Talker ” where  Richard Friedman  is the music director. I was grateful that in a short period of time I had the chance to come in contact with such important and well-known figures of the industry.’’
Living in LA, Sannios had the chance to meet the fellow Greek award-winning film composer Kostas Christides with numerous credits to his name as a composer of original scores and as an orchestrator.
Kostas has been awarded for “Best Original Music” at Bare Bone International Film Festival and “Best Impact Of Music” at Park City Film Music Festival for his work in the film “29 Reasons To Run”. He is also the recipient of the “Best Original Score” award at the “Greek State Film Awards 2006” for his work in the German-Greek production “ Eduart “. He has composed music for “ The Stan Lee Story ”, “ Love Happens ” (Universal), “ Black Tulip ” (Fox), “ Perkins ” 14 (Lions Gate), “ Untraceable ” (Paramount), “ Dark Ride ” (Lions Gate) amongst others.
“For me, getting involved in another promising collaboration, especially with a fellow Greek composer, was something more than welcome. I was aware of Kostas worldwide success back in Greece. I admire his orchestral textures and the clever way that Kostas brings every instrument of his entire orchestra out, allowing them to shine. The way he underscores the heightened emotions in combination with his complicated percussive patterns gives a warm character to his work. It always brings out emotions and highlights what matters the most.
With Kostas Christides we have an ongoing collaboration with work that includes music editing for a psychological thriller and music and foley editing for a documentary.’’
Working backstage was something new for Sannios as he was already a successful singer/songwriter and performer.
As he says: “I moved to LA during the pandemic. Working with people in the film scoring industry allowed me to enter a different environment from the one that I had used to. It was for me a new and alternative way of approaching music as a whole. This environment deals with music that is composed and recorded to fit the story of a film and to adhere to a strict timecode. You have to delve into the mental space of the movie and immerse yourself in a specific music genre or culture, and at the same time make critical decisions on things like instrumentation and sound design that can affect the overall outcome of the production. I can say that I like and enjoy both worlds, and I feel happy and fortunate that I opened that door.”
Everything happens for a reason and Sannios with his story is a living proof and grateful about it.",Entertainment

Enticed into the dark place where creatures slither, where dark spirits dwell, and where no man ever returns in one piece, the prince is jolly and seemingly ripe for the slaughter. Meghan, the smiling face of deceit, power play, greed and narcissism leads him by the hand with slithering seductive whispers in his ear, promises that are steeped in lies and perfidiousness.
You must give everything you have, you must be completely possessed by my power, you must relinquish your very soul to me, everything must be taken from you, and for this I will only give you misery and heartache, the harridan whispers gently, almost a lulling hypnotic chant that he cannot relinquish himself from.
The winding roots seem to move as the prince is led deeper into the bowels of the darkness, and yet he still does not realise what is going on.
Just a little farther we shall go, she whispers. The snakes suddenly come alive, hissing and seething with excitement as the skipping fool nears.
All manner of beasts congregate, they have been priorly invoked to sup on this feast fast approaching. Some of these creatures even jostle for position in anticipation of the first bite.
Led like a lamb to the slaughter, Meghan stands still whilst Harry innocently continues walking. The grinning smirk on her face tells all, as the forest envelopes the poor prince with one almighty gulp.

The Cowardly Artists Who Stayed Silent,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/43161-the-cowardly-artists-who-stayed-silent.html,2021,"How we used to idolize artists when we were growing up. Here were these gods and goddesses who were above everything, they could stand up and stick their finger up with vitriol, they could shout out aloud at the injustices, they could bring forth real societal change simply with a few words in an interview or news flash.
Artists whether musical/authors/painters/film or conceptual made sheer statements in their art. They were not afraid to voice their opinion, their dreams, their fears for what was to come. They were not afraid to question. Injustice was trodden on by these heroes as they pushed their fists in the air defiantly. This was why they were artists, it was this ‘fuck you!’ to everything wrong in society and government that made them real artists.
Forward to 2020/21 and now there is only the sound of silence, of crickets with tumbleweed blowing across a society where heavy censorship and cancel culture is applauded.
Where are the heroes and heroines of the past, and their voices, their shouts of anger at what is happening, how all our right to free expression and speech has been ultimately eviscerated from beneath us? The Woke Stasi monsters and their Big Tech conglomerates stifling all forms of free speech, art and the basic human right to self-expression make any Orwellian dystopia look like a picnic in the park, and yet, still silence, not one word from any artist. Whatever your views, political persuasion, or viewpoint, the end of freedom of speech affects everyone in the end.
Have all the eccentrics and artists been silenced? Afraid of your ‘legacy’ and sales going down if you say the slightest ‘wrong’ word? Well, maybe that would be a good thing, if you were a real artist and not a conglomerate stooge, a coward who tricked their way to the top, who was never a real fearless artist with integrity or purpose in the first fucking place — maybe a little reality would do you some good.
No! Everything is NOT all right!
You, as an artist, are now too scared to create from the heart any more. You are a yellow coward with no backbone, a failure to the mantle of artistry, a disgrace to the muse, and ultimately a piffling shadow of the artists that preceded you before the mass censorship deluge.
From silence can only come silence, yet it is up to only a few places or individuals to make a stand. Through this deathly silence, there is still some resistance to the evil of shutting down human conversation, through the darkness there is still some light, and where other so-called ‘artists’ have abandoned the fight, succumbed to their cowardice and corporate greed, there are still some, on the outskirts who will continue to stick their finger defiantly at the censorious puss filled zits of the Woke Marxist jailers.
Stay silent you fake cowardly artists, your silence is more telling than anything you may presume to have created in the past.",Entertainment
Archehole: Harry and Meghan Reveal New Money Making Venture,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/36508-archehole-harry-and-meghan-reveal-new-money-making-venture.html,2020,"Former royals, Harry and Meghan, who have recently moved to Los Angeles, are setting up a new organisation called Archehole.
In a statement, they said “We are fed up of the global COVID-19 pandemic taking up our precious publicity but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how the Archehole commodity came to be”.
The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their  royal titles at the end of last month, allowing Meghan to resume her z-list career in acting, and have trademarked their own son to make money off selling cheaply produced tat to their deluded, deranged anti-royal fans.
In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand.
The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States.
Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole.
The name Archehole combined an ancient word for strength and action, with another that “evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon through our assholes”.
“We have launched Archehole during a global pandemic because as narcissists we cannot be out of the news for more than two weeks plus we need some fucking money sharpish,” they said.

Creature That Bleeds Once a Month is Not a Woman,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/37381-creature-that-bleeds-once-a-month-is-not-a-woman.html,2020,"Can’t say it’s not thoroughly enjoyable to see factions of champagne socialist celebrities all having a nice bust up, as is the case with J.K. Rowling, Daniel Radcliffe and the now ‘corrected’ Jonathan Ross.
Apparently J.K. Rowling is not a woman but a creature that bleeds once a month and manages to live afterwards, or something like that.
This frightfully odd behaviour is sort of relegated to the female of the species, but not to the transgender male chromosome, male bone structured ‘female’ of the species, but it is wrong to say it is so, even if nature intends it to be that way.
If this is getting rather confusing, do not worry, just open up a Harry Potter book and forget about it all.

Marxist BLM Bolsheviks Successfully Ruin Comedy,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/37404-marxist-blm-bolsheviks-successfully-ruin-comedy.html,2020,"The DS knew something was brewing some time in late May with all the BLM riots and increased levels of  censorship  on the social media forums, but we never foresaw the deletion of some classic British comedy from streaming services like Netflix and the BBC as a solution to anything.
As great shows like the wonderfully acted and unique The League of Gentlemen, with the sheer comedic genius of Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss, Jeremy Dyson were erased by the humourless Bolsheviks, as well as Little Britain, Ali G, Bo Selecta, Harry Enfield, and The Mighty Boosh, we thought to ourselves that it’s not just comedy that has been hit hard, but the actual tenets of democracy, freedom of speech, art and expression.
The illiterate pieces of detritus, ignorant American Marxist brainwashed puritanical commie bastards who do not have an ounce of humour in their humourless black souls are the actual ones who should be deleted, but instead, they are celebrated and listened to by the virtue signalling corporations, and mainstream media. This is something that is very sinister, and inherently evil, because it reveals that there has been mass infiltration of soviet Chinese Communist Maoist totalitarian ideology into these controlling elements.
The ironic part of all of the mass deletion of these comedy shows is that many of the comedians and their work affected are avowed socialists, who have been directly hit by their own soviet censorship boards, thus eviscerating their royalty cheques in one fell swoop.
Whatever happened to freedom of choice? Does it not exist in a universe where puritanical humourless cunts dictate what you can and can’t watch or read?
This really is a major decline in Western civilisation, democracy which hold the tenets of freedom of expression, art, and liberty of choice.
If you don’t like something, switch over, or don’t watch it — you filthy communist cunt!. Are you such a frail piece of brainwashed shit that you can’t simply watch something else, and have to ruin it for millions of people who do watch it? The ignorant, humourless illiterate American BLM mob who do not understand British comedy, should not be meddling with something they do not, and will never understand.

J.K.

Camp Transwarts is a prison re-education camp that Pol Pot would be proud of, where prisoners are brainwashed into believing the soviet style mantras they are forced to repeat in unison day after day.
“Repeat after me, this is a woman (pointing to a picture of a person with a large Adam’s Apple, vast square cheekbones, a moustache, large breasts, and a huge penis replete with a hairy scrotum)…and this is a man (pointing to a picture of a person with huge hips, a moustache, large breasts and a menstruating vagina with a fake penis dangling over it).”
Unfortunately for Rowling, no magic or spells are allowed in the re-education camp, because they could be used to escape, or even worse, misgender someone.
To date, no one has ever managed to escape Camp Transwarts, but one prisoner got as far as the Forbidden Trannie Forest, where they were later found with no cock or balls and a look of abject fright etched all over their face.

Some Sort of Lives Do Something,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40214-some-sort-of-lives-do-something.html,2020,"I’ll admit, before I walked into that plant-based, crispy-chicken-sandwich co-op, I was naïve—a pitiful ignoramus, even. Don’t get me wrong, I’d always been perfectly aware of lives (and the many different manifestations that said lives might take).  I suppose my knowledge of various types of lives and their respective doings just lacked a certain specificity—the slightest of nuances— a je ne sais quoi.
On that fateful lunch-hour, coming-and-going out of that colorful eatery, I counted hundreds of varieties of lives:  There were bent-over lives and fully erect lives—fabulous lives and dull, boring, drab lives.  There were lives in heels and lives on wheels.  There were lives with gaping holes in their earlobes and lives with faded knuckle tattoos.  Also, there were roly-poly lives and skinny-as-a-rail lives.  Hairy, bald, thin and thick lives; pasty, paltry, piggish and/or puppyish lives; rich, bitchy, snooty, snobbish, highfalutin lives and  et cetera —lives galore—no shortage of them.
As I watched and pondered, astute observer I am, it occurred to me that I had once been aware of one specific classification of lives that fulfilled a highly specified function—but what sort of lives those were and what it was that they did exactly I just couldn’t quite put my finger on.  I knew, for instance, that burger-flipping lives wear paper hats (that’s common knowledge).  I recalled from my schooling days that janitorial lives tie knots in garbage bags and lunch-serving lives stock tiny milk-cartons into knee-level refrigerators.  Conversely, some other lives are notorious for what they do not (or cannot) do.  For instance, odoriferous lives don’t bathe and incontinent lives can’t unbuckle their jeans fast enough.
Perhaps, I thought, all lives perform this isolated all-important task (whatever it might be).  That would make sense as according to the principles of equity and inclusivity (which had just been explained to me very slowly in a mandatory ZOOM seminar).   I soon found myself shaking my head at that notion, however.  All lives couldn’t possibly conform to the same rigid schedule—they’d collide head-first.  Whatsmore:  even if  all lives were adept at carrying out this illusive function, this fact might (for reasons undoubtedly valid) be better left unstated.
But what was it? I wondered aloud.  I was growing evermore agitated at my inability to recall this critical bit of information.  Feathered lives lay eggs.  Pubescent lives squeak when they talk.  Francophile lives daydream about summer-homes in Nice. Non-sequitur lives eat Korean shrimp-chips while jangling keys at babies and humming the National Anthem in reverse.  Dammit! I shouted.  Something  lives  something…
The young lady(?) behind the counter very graciously thrust my order at me without saying a word.  Turning toward the door, I took a quick peak in the bag and realized that she’d forgotten to include my complimentary pickle (a serendipitous mistake if ever there was one).  I paused to breathe a sigh of complete exasperation and, as it would happen, out of the corner of my eye, in a profoundly epiphanic moment,  I saw the sign.

Sex, glamour, danger, excitement and mystery are now relics of a bygone era. Hollywood is now solely focused on Woke, socially conscious, boring and sorrowful mediocre banal shit.
That’s okay though because now anyone can watch anything they want streamed on the net for free, either on a  movies123 , or a  putlockers  site from a server somewhere deep in China, or pay a small monthly fee to Netflix or Amazon. Hollywood is now irrelevant and the funny thing is, it brought all this upon itself by going Woke, and becoming some kind of Marxist tool for indoctrination that makes people switch off immediately.
The Oscars Cemetery
The Wokerati few all dolled up to the nines, sat around a few seats in a train station, a place where the trains coming and going would be infinitely more interesting than watching the pathetic luvvie champagne socialist scum trip over their frail egos.
This year it was a BLM festival Oscar ceremony where black actors were paraded in front of the cameras two to a dozen, all raising their fists in defiance of the white money men who financed their shit films that no one will watch or remember.
“I hate all white folk and hope you all die soon!” one black actor said in her acceptance speech to cheers from the assembled NPCs.
Many of the actors and actresses on parade on the night were unknown to many, and as they sashayed down the red carpet, in some households many probably had to do an internet search to find out who the fuck just made an acceptance speech. Of course, many probably did not bother to even do an internet search and just let it go.
“I doubt I would know who they were even with an internet search.”
On and on it went for over two hours, faceless, soulless, talentless, and with not an ounce of humour to spice things up a little.
Ricky Gervaise, even you would have a hard time coming up with material to say amongst the cadavers on display yesterday, and your non-invite was in fact a blessing.

The only similarity between the two authors is they are both disgraced former members of the royal family.
“Meghan Markle’s new book is a delight, although there is something slightly wrong with it. Well, how can I say this. Ahem! It smells of poo! I suppose that’s why it is called ‘The Stench’,” prominent book critic, Barners Barnstorme, revealed in his weekly book review column.
In fact, ‘The Stench’ stinks so much some bookshops have elected to display the book in a hermetically sealed glass case so that prospective buyers are not put off too much. It gives off a horrible stench of betraying fatherhood, as Markle has treated her own father despicably, and has ruined Harry and Charles’ relationship completely.
Publisher, Sea Lion, were adamant that their money invested in Markle would eventually pay off, even though her book is a blatant rip off of this  one .
“We got this urgent call that Meghan was planning a  17th bathroom  for her Montecito McMansion, and she wanted to raise funds fast. Naturally, we obliged, it makes no sense to have less than 17 bathrooms in your mansion.

What the fuck happened to Prince Harry?  Forget about shooting pheasants, Harry now is more at home with knitting a cardigan. How about watching the rugger at Twickers with the lads? Harry now prefers to read out some nonsense Woke pap Meghan wrote for him on their new Spotify podcast.
Harry has seemingly forgotten about Britain, a land now struggling under a Covid pandemic, and a people who genuinely enjoyed the antics of the former prince.
“Meghan Markle has brainwashed the prince. It is something that narcissist control freaks love to do, similar to cults, they isolate their mark, and eventually Harry was told to leave his own family and friends, country behind. It was all about the money, Meghan planned the move to the USA before the wedding, and forced Harry to leave everything behind, including his royal role, so she could use his status to make money. They claimed they left because of privacy issues, however that is clearly not the case exhibited by all the publicity opportunities in North America they have indulged in,” an analyst revealed on Sunday.

But after making $200,000 in sales, the influencer has announced her retirement when she passed one too many and got the wind knocked out of her, Jam Press reported.
Matto was rushed to a hospital with chest pains she feared were symptoms of a heart attack, according to the outlet.

Psychiatrist: “Harry is Projecting His Mental Illness onto Audience and Father”,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/42173-psychiatrist-harry-is-projecting-his-mental-illness-onto-audience-and-father.html,2021,"Dr. Hubert Wilkins, a prominent psychiatrist from the Wilhelm Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, was asked to analyse the recent public outbursts of former British royal, Harry.
“Analysing the recent outburst of Harry, it is safe to state that the former prince is projecting his own mental illness and internal denial mechanisms onto others, namely his father Prince Charles, his grandmother and deceased grandfather. What we define as projection are the elements of thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one’s own which are consolidated by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else. All projections elicit counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject. Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual representational enactment.
“During his latest outburst Harry is quoted as saying: ‘There’s no blame. But certainly when it comes to parenting, if I have experienced some kind of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father, or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle, so I don’t pass it on.’ He starts off with the words ‘There’s no blame’ but goes on to blame his father and other royals immediately after that statement. Harry also states that the ‘pain’ he attributes to others should not be transferred to his own children, however what he is doing by publicly speaking about his mental pain is actually going to affect his children in the future when they can read. Rather hypocritically, he is actually doing what he just blamed on his own father and grandparents, but in a worse manner, to millions of listeners worldwide. One can only conclude that his motivation is not as he states, in protecting his children, but of sheer vengeance, and narcissistic retaliation projected upon his relatives.
“Harry is most certainly a person with a split narcissistic schizoid personality, as the evidence presents itself. Whatsmore, projection is more commonly found in narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. Harry does display elements of schizophrenic psychosis, which does come to explain some of the dualistic personality traits he seems to exhibit.
“Harry’s mental illness is however treatable and manageable. He states that he is getting help for his various psychiatric disorders, possibly through extensive therapy and drug treatment. I would go further to suggest that Harry should be chaperoned by medically trained staff on a daily basis, as a means to not only protect himself, but others he comes into contact with. Furthermore, outbursts on radio programmes and television only damage Harry’s already fragile mental state, and he should not display his mental illness as a badge of honour just to be vindictive to others with his projection, or to gain sympathy for his narcissism.”",Entertainment
The Vile Protestations of Innocence From an Entitled Black Actor,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41990-the-vile-protestations-of-innocence-from-an-entitled-black-actor.html,2021,"There’s no smoke without fire, and when 20+ women come out concerning  sexual abuse  from a protected black actor, the race card is the only defence from the likes of scum like actor Noel Clarke. Once celebrated by the Wokerati champagne socialist luvvie club, now a pariah with only a dodgy tattered race card to play in his defence.
“Black actors in showbiz were given a free pass, doors were opened for them, and some of them abused their positions. Pieces of shit like Clarke are only too prevalent, and this is the price people pay for letting animals like this to run wild,” an undisclosed film worker revealed.
No doubt putrid detritus like Clarke will be fully reprieved for his alleged abuses on young women by the media and champagne socialist actors’ equity card holders.
In YouTube-land another black celebrity has been caught out, this time a grossly obese black man calling himself EDB445 (Eat Dat Pussy 445) who was caught out arranging to meet a 13-year-old white girl, even sending pictures of his shit to what he thought was easy prey. Turned out that the 13-year-old girl was actually a paedophile hunting group, and the meeting was filmed in 4k. Naturally, YouTube defended the child predator because if you’re black you are now a protected individual whatever crimes you commit.
There is one rule for black people now, and a rule for the rest. Protected in every way, given vast privileges over everyone else, and allowed to commit as many crimes as they want without prosecution or reprisal. This is not ‘equality’ but supremacy.",Entertainment
Spotify: To Joe Rogan or Not to Joe Rogan,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44738-spotify-to-joe-rogan-or-not-to-joe-rogan.html,2022,"With the exit of mewling dog rocker, Neil Young, then the yowling Joni Mitchell, we now have Nils Lofgren the 70-year-old guitarist for Springsteen wheeling himself out of the Spotify door. All of this because of some bald muscle man who thinks he is a sort of philosopher has voiced his opinion on the subject of vaccinations. In reality, he has not said anything bad about vaccinations.
Rockin’ in the Cancel Culture World
“I’m not an anti-vax person,” Joe Rogan has  said . “I believe they’re safe and encourage many people to take them.”
Rogan also has commented that healthy people do not need to take the vaccine, and this is where he has fallen into a bit of bother with the vaccination  cancel mob  police.
In the interests of free speech and the right to say what you feel about any given situation, he should be defended to the death, as anyone who profoundly believes in the divine human right to speak freely without undue punishment should be duly afforded.
Sure, we may not always agree with what someone like Joe Rogan says, but it is his right to have an opinion, whatever it is.
Vaccinations have brought hospitalisations down, and although they do not prevent the spread of Covid, vaccinations have saved lives. One only has to look at the data to see, especially in the UK, how there have been minimal deaths from Covid in the third wave.
If a person has the necessary common sense to exist as a human, they will hear what another person says, make an informed reply in agreement or not regarding what the person said, then move on. Why as a society does anyone have to be cancelled? People say or think the oddest things, so what? Is it going to kill you to hear someone else’s opinion on something, however mundane or serious sounding?
Let bygones be bygones, let people exist, let humans express themselves if they fucking well want to, however nonsensical or ridiculous the words or sentences are, what is wrong with a little eccentricity, a little difference?
You would think these Spotify legacy hippies, children of the 60s would understand the concept of freedom of speech, but it seems in their old age they have turned sour and lifeless. Fling your corpses onto the burning pyre right now, you are not worthy of artistry anymore, it has left you because you hate freedom of expression, you are not worthy of the guitar or microphone anymore, and Jim Morrison’s ghost pisses on your rotting formaldehyde heads.
If people die without taking the Covid vaccination, it was their choice to do so. They should be praised for their bravery for dying for their cause. You as a vaccinated person do not need to directly care about any of the deaths, yes it is a tragedy, but they made their choices freely and this should be respected. If you wear a proper rated mask, and take the necessary precautions, let the others who choose not to vaccinate or wear masks die from the deadly virus. It is their right to do so, and it is your right to take precautions.
Stop trying to preach to vaccine dodgers, just let them be, and they will in turn leave you alone? Definitely this world needs more humility, more understanding and most of all it needs its freedom of expression back.
Let Joe Rogan keep his $100 million Spotify talk show, it’s certainly worth more than all the one-hit wonder legacy stars who have spoiled in their old age. They can certainly rot in their multi-million dollar mansions atop the Hollywood Hills, reading their well thumbed copies of Das Kapital. If those old fuckers cannot recognise why free speech is so precious anymore, they deserve nothing better than to have the exalted muse take the little talent they had and relegate them to the wilderness of cowardly failure for eternity.",Entertainment
Exiled Prince Andrew to Go Live With Harry and Meghan in 16 Bathroom California Mansion,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44628-exiled-prince-andrew-to-go-live-with-harry-and-meghan-in-16-bathroom-california-mansion.html,2022,"Thrown to the dogs  by his own mother, brother and niece, a befuddled Prince Andrew really was lost, until a chink of light broke through the winter darkness.
January, is always a fucker of a month, however for Andrew it has been an absolute motherfucker of a month. His military medals have been taken away, his HRH rescinded, and he is now known as a pariah to everyone in Britain.
On Thursday night, Andrew received a phone call from Montecito, California. Harry and Meghan have already made up a room for Andrew in their  16 bathroom mansion  in Montecito.
“They could call it the ‘exile mansion’ or something like that. I am sure the now exiled Prince Andrew was delighted at the offer of sanctuary from the royal family that kicked him out so unceremoniously. The only problem with the plan is the small thing about prison. Andrew will be on American soil, and there will be no long extradition battle if he was still in Blighty. He could always escape to Mexico or somewhere in South America though, you know do an Escobar,” royal commentator, Keith Melons, revealed in the Sun.
Netflix executives have been scrambling at the news and are anticipating a huge ratings bonanza when Andrew turns up at the Montecito mansion, where filming for the Harry and Meghan series will take a new turn.
If all that does not work out, there’s always room in some shack on the Falkland Isles. It’s a place close to the heart of the fallen war hero who flew helicopters for his country, that has now abandoned him.
Gerald Hopkins, 57, a farmer from Goose Green, Falklands, said the wayward prince is always welcome.

Palace aides have now been preparing Prince Andrew for a long stretch in an American prison after the demands for his extradition are met.
One close consort to the prince revealed some unsettling details: “The prince is being prepared for a long stretch in an American prison. We have employed an ex convict from America to teach the prince how to survive in jail. He has to learn how to defend himself on a daily basis, learn how to fend off the bum rapers, and if he is not able to harden up, will have to learn how to suck dick. It is a terrible fate for the prince, and we will do everything in our power to halt this extradition order, but we’re afraid when it comes to power, the Americans have it all and us Brits have pretty much nothing.”
Surviving in a hardcore American prison is no cake walk, especially for someone of Prince Andrew’s pedigree.
“The prince gotta get hard otherwise he gonna be somebody biotch, and don’t drop the soap in the shower n shiet! Drop the soap and you dead meat, yo azz cheeks will be pumped!” ex con, Trayvon Manding, revealed on Friday, giving the prince some advice.
It also depends on who your cellmate is in prison. Get the wrong cellmate, and you will be glugging down gallons of stinking convict gloop for the rest of your stretch, and not be able to walk without a severe limp.",Entertainment

Let’s say I am a Winston Churchill fan, because he was a man of true greatness, and he pretty much won World War II, saving Britain from the Nazis. I want to donate money to a charity that embodies the principles and greatness of Sir Winston Churchill. So I go to The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, only to find that he has been completely airbrushed out of existence by some Woke  overpaid  communist cunts who have infiltrated the Trust. They removed all of his pictures and every detail of his life. Would I give a single penny to that charity?

Harry Buys Apache Attack Helicopter Now Parked at Montecito Mansion,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/43575-harry-buys-apache-attack-helicopter-now-parked-at-montecito-mansion.html,2021,"Much to the chagrin of the Montecito neighbours of Meghan and Harry, the noise created by Prince Harry’s new acquisition, a second-hand  AH-64 Apache , twin-turboshaft attack helicopter from the defeated Afghan campaign, is becoming quite bothersome.
Julio Gonzalez, 42, who owns a property close to the Sussex clan, has clearly had enough.
“He [Harry] opens the engines up at five in the morning, then flies around their big garden for sometimes one hour. The other day he was hovering over my bedroom window just after I had given our maid, Conchita, a good seeing to on the bed. I bet he saw everything, the dirty bastard, and if my wife hears about it, ay Dios mío, I am muerto! I should have seen the spotlight, but I was too busy.”
Prince Harry is supposedly an expert pilot of the Apache helicopter, and during his tour of Afghanistan dispatched thousands of Afghans.
One of his former co-pilots, Flight Lieutenant, Roger “Balls” Kinsky, spoke highly of Harry’s heroic Apache escapades.
“Crazy days man, we called Harry “Trigger”, because he would unload AGM-114s like they were going out of fashion. One day, we had some Marines pinned down in a village complex in Pishin Lora. The Commander just said, “Send Harry in”.  When he got there, he was drunk as a skunk, he took out the Muj and the entire squad of Marines, plus 351 civilians. Like, he was royalty, so the Commander just let that one go, it was written up as Mission Accomplished.”
The prince has obviously been given special dispensation to purchase and keep the Apache helicopter on his property by Californian legislators, but if he causes any damage or death, they may say something about the whole matter.
As for Meghan Markle, she is reported to be okay with the new purchase, and puts it all down to “boys and their toys” besides some of that Netflix cash had to go somewhere.",Entertainment

Chapter 1
“…and immediately after meeting her, I was totally under her spell. She hypnotised me with her stare, and she told me that I will be an ambassador for all world good. I will also be instrumental in ruining the Windsor royal family to make way for the new Woke communist age of China. At first, I questioned it a little, thinking that I was part of the royal family at the time, but when she unzipped my trousers and knelt down I…”
“…planning our escape came as early as the third date. I was sick of royal life, all the rigmarole of getting everything I asked for without paying for it, playing second fiddle to William really pissed me off when it was I who should be King. I can play rings around Granny, and fool her every time. She has no idea what Meghan is planning to do…”
“…Meghan told me I have to pretend that everything is normal, and must never reveal her plans to escape to America. Tomorrow is our £45 million wedding, so it’s great that the British taxpayer foots that bill as usual. I am so excited that Meghan has thought about everything for me, and she guarantees it will all be okay. We have already spoken to Oprah and Clooney, and Meghan says Netflix is already in the bag. We will use the royal name to make millions. Ooh, can’t wait. This will show papa and Wills that I should not be dismissed and denigrated…”
Chapter two
“…Meghan treats the servants like shit, so I started to do it too. I am so under her control, I cannot even go to the bathroom without asking her first. I put a few more millions in her account simply because she asked. What Meghan wants, she gets…”
“…as soon as we have the baby, we’re off. I can’t take it any more, Meghan constantly talks about using the Sussex name to make millions in America. We have so much dirt on them, it will be great to spill the beans once and for all. Papa was even worried about the baby’s colouring, and Meghan went berserk. To tell you the truth, so was I, in the back of my mind, what if it’s the colour of a jigg*boo? She was on the phone to Oprah for over an hour after that. When she got off the phone, she smiled and said we were going to make millions, before unzipping my trousers and kneeling down…”
Chapter three
“…I will soon see Meghan in Canada. I am so excited. She told me that I have to say goodbye to Britain, and the Royal Family, my military uniforms, my friends, all royal privileges, everything I never worked for including most of my money so that I can start a new life with her. It’s good that she has nothing to lose, and I will lose absolutely everything just because she has me totally under her thumb and can give great blow jobs…”
Chapter six
“…the money is rolling in. We fooled the idiot royal-crazy executives at Netflix, and Spotify to hand over millions. They will get minimal material from us. Meghan wakes up every day and I can literally see dollar signs in her eyes. The other day though, I asked her if I could phone an old friend from England, when she threatened me once again, she said she will leave with the kid and all my money and I will not be able to go back because I have disgraced and betrayed my family. I cried in front of her, but she simply laughed and told me to go and sit in the corner…”
“…and after the Oprah special interview, Meghan was ecstatic. She told me that I played my part great. I told the lies she told me to say with a straight face, happy with my performance, she unzipped my trousers and knelt down…”

Lady KaKa obviously does not have any qualms on pushing a corrupt senile old man onto the American Public, Joe Biden has done nothing for America in 47 years apart from serious corruption, money laundering and taking greedy  backhanders from dodgy Chinese deals . At no time does she even mention how  Joe Biden is an asset for the Chinese Communist Party , who plan on taking over America from the inside if elected.

Comrades and Commissars – Juche – How to Live Well the North Korean Way,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/39304-comrades-and-commissars-juche-how-to-live-well-the-north-korean-way.html,2020,"Dear Comrades, this is a brief review of the wonderful book that will form your re-education into JUCHE – How to Live Well the North Korean Way.
Living the way of Juche does not necessarily mean you will have to live your pitiful North Korean life eating boiled shoe soles, or the bark off trees, or boiled grass, it means much, much more.
Juche means ‘self-reliance’ and is pronounced ‘joo-chay’. As in some socialist nations like  Venezuela , we can see Juche is utilised to great effect, where used toilet paper is supplied, and lucky socialist citizens pick their fresh lunch and dinner from rubbish dumps.
Living well the North Korean way should not be the preserve of Politburo members who get to shop in special shops, and even have their own lanes on the motorways, it should be a philosophy that exemplifies the mighty culture of the Fatherland.
Reading this book, or should we say manual on how to live correctly, and to think in the right Soviet self-reliant mindset will set you free from the gross Imperialistic injustices of Capitalism which fills every decent Juche following North Korean with immense disgust.
You must forge a path through this Red Book of Juche implementing its many doctrines so that you yourself are an island of self-sufficiency and others will look up to you as a beacon of Soviet light.
From work, lifestyle, entertainment, relationships and the final curtain — ageing, this amazing book will teach you how to live, to love your enslavement to communism, and will even give you essential tips on North Korean interior design.
Replete with guides on how to deflect the slings and arrows of banal Western culture and capitalistic outrage, Juche will show you the Western terrible way of living, and then conduct your attention to the correct Soviet way of living.
This book will even show you what to say on North Korean dating apps, although there are no North Korean dating apps as many are not allowed an internet connection or smartphone in the DPRK, but that is neither here nor there, it is quite possible high ranking Soviet Comrades are allowed to pretty much do anything they want, and have access to whatever Western capitalistic vice that exists.
Put down your North Korean champagne, for you are simply a Socialist comrade from Islington, North London, you must purchase this book for your family members this Christmas, then throw the turkey out the window and replace it with a quarter ration of boiled rice.
Comrades,  order your book now  or forever be consigned to waste, greed and the evil of free market capitalism — JUCHE is the ONLY WAY!

“Someone who is catgender may use nya/nyan pronouns” (meaning ‘meow’ in Japanese).
The “catgender” pronoun reveals that some individuals are ‘xenic’ – and their gender is therefore not aligned to “the Western human binary of gender alignments”.
“Catgender” is described as “[feeling] an extremely strong connection to cats or other felines, either strongly identifying with them or simply wanting to incorporate them into their gender to better understand their identity”.
Bristol university tutors now scurry around in the hallways of the university, sniffing for mice. Forget about teaching students, they sleep all day and demand to be fed treats when they care to arise from their slumber.
American Dream Megamall Has Just $820 In Its Reserve Account
This one is more about irony than being beyond satire, however it is included anyway simply because it sort of sums up the ‘American Dream’ very succinctly. What is more American than a megamall and one that is called ‘ American Dream Megamall ‘? What can a mall of that size do with $820 left in its bank account? Fuck knows? Maybe arrange a barbecue for the staff before firing everyone? It’s the American dream, innit?
Woman ‘gang raped’ in VR Metaverse Says Tech Advances Made it Feel Like Real Life
Without wishing to denigrate the brutality of real physical rape, this news story had to be included simply because it was so beyond satire, it exemplifies the tragedy of the modern tech age. To have some avatars on a VR screen jump on you is NOT fucking rape. For a start, avatars don’t have genitals, they do not have penises, vaginas, balls or flopping tits. In fact, the avatars in Zuckerberg’s metaverse don’t even have a lower body.
Insane Nina Jane Patel, the vice president of research for a rival metaverse company, claims she was ‘verbally and sexually harassed’ and ‘virtually gang raped’ by a group of men within 60 seconds of logging into ‘Horizon Venues’, a VR world owned by Meta (formerly Facebook).
This sort of nonsensical digital shit trivialises real rape in the physical world, and Ms Patel needs to go to her  safe space  bubble or whatever it is and permanently stay there from now on.
Boris Johnson Investigated For Partygate Whilst Russia Set to Invade Ukraine Any Day Now
What does it say about how low Western society has deteriorated that a PM is being investigated for some trivialities when a country like Russia is on the eve of attacking a Western allied nation, namely Ukraine? For fuck’s sake, during WW2, Churchill was not punished for walking around with a big fat cigar in his mouth, a glass of champers in one hand and a bottle of brandy in the other. In times of grave national stress, leaders have to cope the best they can do, and if it means letting off some steam with a bit of booze, so be it. These forces who are pushing this Partygate nonsense are anti-Western elements, agents working to destroy us from within, and the intelligence agencies need to take these people out forthwith. The utter pathetic ridiculousness of it all certainly qualifies the Partygate fiasco as being Beyond Satire.
Woman Charged With ‘Bodily Harm’ After Fighting Off Syrian Rapist
The woman who fought off a rapist was charged with ‘bodily harm’ by police for defending herself. The attack occurred in Vienna. Beyond Satire or just another example of EU legislation gone very wrong. Women should be allowed to do anything to rapists without the fear of punishment.
Shortly before midnight on Tuesday last week, the 22-year-old woman wanted to enter the entrance area to her apartment building on Schönbrunner Strasse in the district of Meidling when she was attacked out of nowhere. The attacker pushed the woman into the courtyard, immediately grabbed intimate parts of the body and pushed his victim to the ground, according to Austrian newspaper  Kronen Zeitung .
But then the rape attempt took a dramatic turn: the woman, with presence of mind, managed to pull a knife out of her purse. She stabbed her attacker several times with it until he let go of his victim, grabbed her purse and ran away badly injured.

Beautiful Card From Meghan and Harry Celebrates Holidays,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/44443-beautiful-card-from-meghan-and-harry-celebrates-holidays.html,2021,"The beautiful card released from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Montecito, California, USA, was a gift to the people for another wonderful year of profits.
Across the internet, the masses positively gushed about the incredible picture card celebrating the holiday season of Christmas and New Year from Harry and Meghan.
The Sussexes have truly come far, and are now celebrated by everyone in the USA and the UK.
“They are such a brilliant couple, so giving to everyone with their words. Just yesterday, while I was vomiting into a bucket, I heard Harry lecturing on the radio about how to act and think. Well, he helped me get the rest of the mackerel out. Thank you, Harry!” Elisa Knowles, from Plaistow, England, revealed on her Twitter account.
The glorious Sussexes have had an astounding year at the top of the pile, and are now revered in America as America’s long-lost royal family.
Joe Biden addressed Meghan and Harry today after receiving the card in the mail.
“We always wanted a royal family in the United States of America, and what better than a royal couple who are so in tune with communism. When the ANTIFA Bolsheviks take over America, they will put Harry and Meghan at the top of the state pyramid…or something like that, shibado, num num num! Nurse?

Marxism is a very powerful anti-democratic, anti-free speech ideology, and it has been adopted by and infiltrated all media/universities/government/schools in the West. Pushed by China, and the CCP, demoralization of many Western nations is now complete.
People are now clamouring for more totalitarianism and censorship, because they have been programmed to do so over decades of indoctrination.
You have been taught to hate your own skin colour, to bow down and kneel for hating yourself, to hate your own heritage/history/biology. Men have been mentally castrated, emasculated to detest their own biological makeup.
When George Orwell wrote 1984, he never envisaged such a horrendous totalitarian control system unfold as the Woke Marxist Thoughtcrime internet that has taken shape now.

Fleeting Fame of British Celebrities Exposed,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41520-fleeting-fame-of-british-celebrities-exposed.html,2021,"There’s something about D-list British celebrities that’s well below standard, and if one remembers the 90s with  Eastenders  starlets like Daniella Westbrook and Brian Harvey of the sickly boy band  East17,  their banal cockney stardom was a rite of passage for the common folk who aspired to be lifted from the grime of anonymity.
Embrace the wonder and power of drugs when you look at Daniella Westbrook’s face today in 2021, her skin ravaged by years of cocaine abuse, her nose practically hanging off the destroyed cartilage, she is a stark contrast to the youthful beauty she exuded, she has been through the mincemeat machine more than once, a testament to the excesses of Uncle Charlie. One could postulate that Keith Richards looks better than her, even though he has probably done more drugs than any other soul in the rock’n’roll firmament, and he’s still fucking standing loud and proud. To compare a D-list soap opera actress and one of the greatest rock’n’rollers to ever live is a moot point, talent and career wise, but in the context of looks, there is a certain validity to it.
Brian Harvey, on the other hand is the same ilk as Daniella Westbrook, and he was shamefully a member of some erroneous boy band some decades ago, and is a lesson in the Music Biz’s Mephistophelian ways. How fleeting fame is to many, exploited by evil pedo scum managers these idiots thought they made it, they were sold the dream, yet are now penniless. Harvey now lives in a mid-terraced property in some shit hole part of London, there are no private jets or long winding driveways.  East17  are the epitome of Music Biz nightmares, performing monkeys with egos the size of skyscrapers fuelled by cheap low-quality drugs that have absolutely nothing to show for their putrid performances — absolutely nothing.
Fame is indeed a fleeting moment for many, one only has to peruse the right side of the Daily Mail front page on the web, to wonder who these people all are? Each week a new crop unveils itself, how much did they pay their PR people to get to that innocuous and irrelevant level of existence, these people have no discernable distinguishing features they all look and act the same. It is very hard to even remember their names, and they’re supposed to be ‘famous’ celebrities. All these disgusting vile narcissists vying for that little bit of attention from an increasingly jaded and terminally bored public.
This is why Harvey and Westbrook are the poster children for the morbid death of British celebrity-hood, the devil wrote them up a contract, and they squandered the opportunity, but that’s not the devil’s problem – it never is – he’s still going to collect even if the deal was completed or not.
Choke on your cocaine you gluttonous untalented pukes, look at Daniella Westbrook’s repellant face today and for one second in your mind imagine how beautiful she used to once be, if that ain’t the devil talking through a crack pipe, then what is?
Alternatively you can watch a Brian Harvey rant on YouTube where he is visibly having a complete paranoid drugged up schizoid break down in front of his subscribers.
Whatever the case, there is no rhyme or reason to the way things worked out for these two examples, it just is what it is, and to watch their slow car crash online is somehow liberating, because at the time of their heyday, you knew they were shite and part of a sick celebrity circus of banality, and years after the fact, the proof is in the pudding, to add another cliché to the proceedings.

It does not matter if an image today or piece of literature is perceived as ‘racist’ today, it is a record of humanity in all its forms, and a record of history that should be preserved in all its glory. If history is erased, however nasty it is perceived in the future, then humanity cannot see how it evolved in thought and perception. Deleting history dooms humanity to keep repeating questionable parts of history over, and over again.
Where this hammer and sickle fall every month is another sign that Western democracy and the tenet of basic freedom of expression puts its foot one step closer to the grave.
The despicable demented pieces of cat piss who have brought themselves to cancel some of the Dr. Seuss books, are vile merchants of the enzootic soviet creep that is converging on all Western history, literature, art and science.

Mysterious Man May Know Where Lady Gaga’s Stolen Dogs Are,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41173-mysterious-man-may-know-where-lady-gagas-stolen-dogs-are.html,2021,"Lady Gaga’s dog walker was shot and her two French bulldogs, Koji and Gustav, were stolen Wednesday night in Hollywood, a source close to the singer revealed.
The source said the  celebrity  “is offering half-a-million dollars to anyone who has her two dogs, no questions asked.”
There are many theories going around about who stole the dogs that belong to the celebrity.
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said a man was shot during a robbery before 10 p.m. outside Lady Gaga’s residence and was transported to the hospital in stable condition.
The male suspect, who looked Chinese, took the two bulldogs from the victim, used a semi-automatic handgun and fled the scene in a white sedan, according to police.
One source has allegedly come forward though, and is keeping his identity a mystery due to the nature of the crime.
“I know who took the dogs. I was walking through China Town the other day and accidentally took a wrong turn. In the alleyway were these two little bulldogs that looked suspiciously like the ones Gaga lost.
“It was dark, but I could see these Chinese cooks come out of the backdoor of a Chinese restaurant illegally open. The dogs were in cages, and the Chinese took them into the kitchen. I then heard chopping sounds after a little yelping.”
The Chinese eat dog meat all the time, and believe dog meat has special medicinal properties. There is even a dog eating festival held every year in  Yulin, Guangxi Province, China  where dogs are brutally skinned alive then cooked.
The man then went into the Chinese restaurant to confront the cooks but instead ordered some Chop Suey, because he said it smelled so good.
“After I finished my meal, I crunched down on something hard. It was part of a dog’s collar, it was partially readable I could only make out the letters G-U-S-T.”
After projectile vomiting over the table, the man was thrown out of the restaurant by four angry Chinese waiters, who kept saying what a waste of good food. The waiters then scraped up the vomit to put it in the Won Ton soup for other customers.
Lady Gaga’s entourage were not replying to questions about the alleged incident.
The investigation is ongoing.",Entertainment

Legacy rock bands like Led Zeppelin were pretty much untouchable, that is until the #metoo monster reared its ugly head from beneath the soiled sheets of rock star excess.
Some #metoo snivelling male shill has gone and written a book with unsubstantiated rock’n’roll rumours from over 50 years ago, that may or may not have happened — allegedly. We will not even mention this fungal wart lodged firmly in the arse crack of humanity because to do so might somehow promote their obscene puritan yellow stained book.
How far back do these #metoo lunatics want to go? How about the Spanish Inquisition or the pillaging Viking raids on the coasts of Britain 1000 years ago? What do these hysterical flapping women want from men and history. Yes, the history of men and women is indeed messy, but why dreg it up? This reverse witch hunt is truly ridiculous and completely useless.
Fucking rock star hotel rooms after a gig were smoke-filled Dionysian orgies, no one even saw a face or knew a name, the groupies would all fight over each other to fellate the band, or plonk their bottoms on some rock star’s straining phallus for the hundredth time that night. Amongst the farm yard animals, dead fish, Mars bars and lines of coke, televisions were thrown out of closed hotel windows, groupies were chained to plumbing pipes and some damn great rock songs were written, inspired by these exquisitely Bacchanalian tour jaunts that lasted for years at a time.
Do what thou wilt, and they did, including Ozzy sniffing ants, Motley Crue lining up girls like pinballs, Bowie being served up another willing participant amongst the thousands before, and Jimmy Page receiving exactly what he signed that contract with the horned one in the first place to bloody receive.
Groupies came thick and fast, from Cynthia Plastercaster who made plaster casts of rock star cocks as a form of art, including Jimi Hendrix. Groupies like Nancy Spungen, Bebe Buell, Pamela Des Barres and all the other girls fighting for the ultimate prize after every gig were the juice that rock’n’roll ran on, apart from the booze and drugs that is.",Entertainment
Formerly Funny Aussie Actress Loses Weight and Comedy Ability,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/45205-formerly-funny-aussie-actress-loses-weight-and-comedy-ability.html,2022,"Yeah, we’re talking about Rebel Wilson, who in turning Woke and losing weight is now as funny as anal prolapse surgery conducted with a rusty blunt scalpel. Obviously Wilson, a celebrated Hollywood actress can afford the trainers; the nutritionists, the surgeons and the chef cooked macrobiotic or whatever diet she gets, but can she afford losing her entire humorous repertoire all in one go? Being ‘Woke’ is the antithesis of all creativity, comedy and acting, but Wilson still managed to crawl up the ass of ‘Wokism’ anyway.
The FAFTA Awards, an overflowing shitberg of woke virtue signalling celebrity luvvies all sniffing each other’s bottoms, is a nauseating celebration of mediocrity and champagne socialism all mixed into a bucket of anti-art, anti-creative soviet woke ideology that is more in tune with the former Soviet Union than anything within what once was a democratic free society. What these peddlers of pseudo-Marxist wokeness fart out in their diminutive arse kissing ceremony is an ode to banality and a peculiar brand of conformism that even NPCs in a computer game would baulk at.
Such is the demise of Hollywood and the British Film ‘Industry’ in recent decades that it now mirrors the current state of the Music Biz. Woke agenda after woke agenda is pushed by these despicable cunts. One supposes, if they pursued true artistry and creativity, Chinese communist money would stop funding their foul pusillanimous projects.

This is exactly why these actresses and actors can afford to go woke and tow the soviet party line, because they know that whatever they do, however despicable the picture they star in, Chairman Mao, or Xingping Pong will continue pumping millions of Chinese Yuan into their already overflowing bank accounts.

The Male Feminist’s Guide to Tappin’ That,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/40759-the-male-feminists-guide-to-tappin-that.html,2021,"1.  Avoid eye contact. My Dude: there is nothing more outwardly aggressive than treating a woman like she’s your equal. It’s an archaic practice—a slowly fading remnant of the patriarchy—an insult to her status as an object of your affection. If you  must  sneak a glance at her visage, do it quickly, and then return to shredding up cocktail napkins as you mutter incoherently.
2.  Agree with every statement she makes. If she tells you that her shoes are killing her, tell her they’re killing you, too. If she tells you that they cost a fortune, tell her they were worth every penny. There is no shame in contradicting yourself. Actually, there is. See what I did there?
3.  Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Take responsibility for everything that has ever gone wrong in her life. If she bitches about the traffic, tell her “totes my bad.” If she says the salmon is delicious, say “I’m sorry I didn’t recommend it more highly.” If she tells you to stop apologizing so much, don’t fall for her trap, this is a test of your resolve. Push your bottom lip out as far as it will go and start whining like a puppy. In fact, this is a perfect opportunity to show off your baby-talk skills. In a whimpering moan, tell her: “aww, I’m sawwee.” Now go ahead and rehearse that a few times. There you go! Now you’re getting it!
4.  Remember: backbone = turnoff. Whatever you do on this date, Homie, do it curled up in the fetal position. Pro-tip: pop a thumb in your mouth and give it a hickey. Chances are good that she won’t be able to resist cradling you in her arms—these are her primal instincts—it’s the same reason she refers to herself as ‘Mommy’ when she’s talking to her dog. As you nuzzle into her, listen closely: if you hear her humming and wishing you a sleepy-go-night-night, you can start patting yourself on the back—she’s DTF, bro—guaranteed.
5.  Liken her to all the strong women in your life. Nothing gets the juices flowing like hearing some heart-warming anecdotes about your lesbian Aunt Trixie and her wild sense of abandon. Mega bonus: if the little lady has slathered herself with perfume, close your eyes, lift your nose and sniff. Then, unblinkingly and in your most delicate whisper, tell her it reminds you of that time you helped your Gram-Gram make her ‘extra-special’ pot-pourri.
6.  Profess an affinity for self-proclaimed ‘sluts.’ My Man: no modern woman wants to feel like you’re sizing her up for a long-lasting and meaningful relationship. That sort of thing went out the window along with chastity-belts and witch-dunking, Your Piousness. Assure this little filly that you intend to ghost as quickly as possible. Think about it: the last thing she needs in her life is some asshole junking-up her Netflix algorithm.
7.  Present her with a gift. Chocolate, flowers, jewellery—all fine and dandy (if you’re a chauvinist). If you really want to showcase your unrivalled sensitivity, have your ‘manhood’ prepared ahead of time by a professional taxidermist and wrap it all up in a fancy, red ribbon. She’ll appreciate the pluck. Pun intended.

Naturally, the world revolves around this pea-brained narcissistic trickster, as she engages more and more fantastical impossibilities.

Well, the poor emasculated Harry is now an automaton who parrots everything from the social justice soundbite gallery and even knows all the correct hashtags if questioned.

The Church of Scientology’s leader David Miscavige, has already visited the couple’s Montecito mansion, and rumour has it that Meghan and Harry got on with the cult chief like a house on fire.
“Miscavige sees Harry and Meghan as a real coup for the Church. Oprah introduced the couple to Miscavige. Along with luminaries like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, amongst many Hollywood celebrities in the Scientology cult, the profile of the Church would be raised to legendary status with the new additions,” one Scientology observer revealed on Wednesday.
Harry and Meghan have already been audited, and now carry e-meters wherever they go. Auditing can be an expensive business, and Scientology cult members dish out sums like $10,000 for each audit, sometimes running multiple times a week. You don’t have to be an accountant to realise that money can be pissed away very quickly, enriching the Church of Scientology’s already overrunning coffers further.
According to aides close to the couple, Harry has suddenly been cured of his aversion and anger towards the royal family.
“As soon as he put that e-meter on his head and swished it around, Harry invoked the great Thetans into his bruised soul cleansing him of the negative standard memory bank eons accentuating Harry’s beingness and determinism. His engrams were through the fucking roof man as he went into Est repair mode getting out of his constant service facsimile, and his genetic entity elevated to extreme havingness mode through his reactive mind. I immediately called INCOMM as we went into overrun, and Harry’s OT got a hold of him with infinite perceptics. Harry’s restimulation verificational setting was full of self determinism getting ridness of the suppressive persons in his life. Harry then gave me $20,000 right there and then making me very happy,” the Scientology operator in charge of the former royal revealed in the latest edition of  Freedom Magazine .
It’s safe to say we won’t hear from Harry and Meghan for a while. Thank you, Church of Scientology for your services. Just send the pair to Sea Org and put them in a cage cleaning floors for the rest of their sorry lives.",Entertainment
What Happens When the Masses Stop Enjoying Filming Themselves?,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41256-what-happens-when-the-masses-stop-enjoying-filming-themselves.html,2021,"The masses were given their toys to amuse themselves a few decades ago, amongst the encouragement of grotesque narcissistic indulgence in taking selfies of themselves every 30 seconds, there were the YouTube videos where the masses were given their 15 minutes of fame as Warhol prescribed all those years ago.
What are you going to do after you’ve taken the 100,000th selfie of your face? Which one is the best shot, as you review each one on your hard disk for hours and hours.
What happens however when the masses get bored of filming themselves constantly doing banal tasks? Will this sense of existential ennui cause a major fault line in the system?
By keeping the masses amused at all times is a form of control that serves the controllers very well. Not only are the masses engrossed in their inane pursuits given to deserving ridicule from their Masters, but their conditioned actions also engenders a false sense of importance to the controlled population. You are important because you get 5 million views on your YouTube video of you peeling potatoes, or that photo of a salad on Instagram has over 10 million comments.
Women holding mobile phones to their bodies, their faces, brings out a collective mass euphoria flooding the overall trench of sickening narcissistic deceit and lies prevalent on social media. Of course in today’s society to see women taking pictures of themselves every few minutes, and posting it on some social media site is perfectly acceptable behaviour, however when men do it, there is a certain revulsion as the preening men exude a trait that used to be reserved for the forever camp in the past. Again, today it is perfectly accepted within society for men to be emasculated prima donnas prancing around taking pictures of themselves every five minutes.
It could, however, get rather dangerous if the masses wake up to their conditioning, and the social experiment is exposed. This is why the controlling bodies need to keep inventing new ways to humiliate the masses by constantly giving them new toys to play with.
For the aware, to watch all these people doing these things they do on social media, and everywhere on the internet is truly embarrassing to humanity, and it is also extremely sad to watch such levels of degradation being celebrated by morons who effectively have no control of their minds or bodies.
It’s okay, go and take another pouting photo of yourself, and add it to the thousands already on social media.

Mr Johnson said, “We should be proud that the BBC bought a load of non-existent PPE from a company that sells second hand dolls because the Director General is mates with the companies owner. It was the sort of decision that I can applaud as it stops people talking about that exam thingy the other week. Anyway, I’ve heard the BBC intends to replace Songs of Praise with Gary Linekers’ guide to mosques.”
A spokesman told us, “This whole row has been excellent for the Government. It’s stopped everyone talking about how utterly inept and corrupt we are. I mean, we tried threatening people with being invaded by brown folks from France. That normally works but the exams thing just wouldn’t go away. This Proms thing has really helped as it totally takes attention from us.”
Mr Johnson later told us, “Whiff-whaff, Latin, brrrth, whaff-whiff, fight them on the beaches.”",Entertainment
Nigel Farage leaves LBC for remake of Howards’ Way; Nigels’ Way,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/06/11/nigel-farage-leaves-lbc-for-remake-of-howards-way-nigels-way/,2020,"Nigel Farage has left LBC and got a job on a new remake of Howards’ Way called, Nigels’ Way.
Producer Bill Board told us, “Nigel plays Nigel, a man who has experienced 2 redundancies in 6 months. He leaves London and settles in a seaside town on the south coast of England.”
“Nigel is struggling at the beginning. His kids increasingly hold him in contempt. His wife initially hates her new life and wants to move back to London. This leads to the breakdown of their marriage. We see Nigel hit his lowest ebb with him attempting to give a speech to some empty chairs in his living room.”
“But then things change. Nigel meets some alcoholic xenophobes that happen to be members of the local yachting club. Nigel becomes involved and gradually regains his sense of purpose. He begins campaigning for the ships at the local Navy base to be allowed to sink small boats carrying refugees that he encounters whilst out on his yacht.”
“When this fails he forms a band of brothers with other members of the yachting club. Nigel leads them into the English Channel to do battle with the refugee boats. But they quickly learn they don’t have enough skill. But this isn’t about skill at harassing refugees. It’s about a man finding purpose and camaraderie in his life again through xenophobia.”

Boris Johnson evades detection to win 2020 season of Hunted,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/04/20/boris-johnson-evades-detection-to-win-2020-season-of-hunted/,2020,"Using an impressive combination of stealth, sneakiness and bare-faced cheek, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has trounced both his opponents and his pursuers to claim victory in the 2020 season of Channel 4’s hit reality series
Celebrity Hunted
.
The show in which contestants go on the run for a month and attempt to evade capture by ex-police, intelligence officers and chase teams in blacked-out 4×4’s has gripped viewers since 2015. Despite having access to the fugitives’ personal data, ANPR. CCTV and other powers of state, the hunters led by the Investigative Journalist and ex-detective Mark Wiliiams-Thomas, couldn’t even get close to the elusive Johnson.
“It was astonishing!” said Williams-Thomas, “We had trackers on his bank cards, mobile phone and Twitter account. We even had drones over Chequers. I’ve never encountered such a devious bastard in my life!”
“We though Johnny Mercer was brazen when he sneaked in and out of Parliament to vote, but we’d expect such things from a trained soldier. Mercer can’t hold a candle to Johnson though. We staked out five COBRA meetings following information that the PM generally attends these during national emergencies, but it appears he was tipped off and didn’t show. He was thumbing his nose at us live on the BBC one morning. Our snatch squad was there within minutes and thought they had him surrounded only to watch him vanish into a fridge. They checked the fridge and he had gone, fuck knows where. Probably Narnia or Diagon Alley or somewhere equally magical.”
Johnson’s crowning moment was undoubtedly when he checked into St Thomas’s Hospital in London. Amid blanket media coverage he managed to vanish in plain sight for three whole days while the hunters posted teams on every exit. “We had to step back that time.” admitted Williams-Thomas. “We knew exactly where he was, but obviously we couldn’t just run in and grab him. The NHS staff were stressed enough as it was without us barging in and causing a scene. Turns out he was playing possum and we fell for it. Genius!”
After that, the trail went cold. Johnson’s Twitter account fell silent and he simply disappeared without trace with his pregnant partner. It is unclear whether he made it to the extraction point, but as nobody seems to know where that is, it’s safe to assume he did.
“We give up.” sighed the exasperated Williams-Thomas. “We’re really fed up with chasing shadows and have to concede that the best man won. We probably won’t do another series as frankly, this was an embarrassment. Wanker!”",Entertainment
Prince Harry gets job as Prince Harry look-alike,https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2020/01/20/prince-harry-gets-job-as-prince-harry-look-alike/,2020,"Prince Harry has a new job as a Prince Harry look-alike in Canada.
His new boss told us, “There’s a lot of attention on Prince Harry at the moment. With that attention then demand for a Prince Harry look-alike increases. We’d had several applications but nobody that looked right. Then Prince Harry turned up and he was perfect. He can do the voice and everything. We’re sure he’ll be a success.”
A spokesman for Prince Harry told us, “Who says a lifetime of cutting ribbons isn’t useful? Prince Harry has only been looking for work a week and got a job already. This should serve as an example to people out there. Don’t lose faith because if all else fails you can become a look-alike of yourself.”
It’s rumoured that Prince Harry’s first engagement will be as a replacement for Prince Andrew at a Royal Family photo call. One insider said, “He’s perfect for it. He knows all the script and everything”
The spokesman has refused to comment on allegations that Prince Harry will play Prince Harry in The Crown. “It could get confusing when he plays the part of Prince Harry impersonating Prince Harry as Prince Harry in The Crown. It might just be easier to get Ed Sheeran to do it.”",Entertainment

Luis Manzano As Carlos Yulo?,https://adobochronicles.com/2024/09/03/luis-manzano-as-carlos-yulo/,2024-09-03T14:41:58-07:00,"In a move that’s sure to raise eyebrows and possibly some high-flying flips, Carlos Yulo reportedly wants Luis Manzano, an actor known more for his witty banter than athletic prowess, to portray him in a biopic. Never mind that Manzano stands a foot taller and has a physique better suited for action flicks than a pommel horse. The real question is, will Manzano have to train in gymnastics to accurately portray Yulo? Perhaps he’ll channel his inner Simone Biles, or maybe Yulo will be his own stunt double—though the sight of Manzano gracefully sticking a landing with Yulo’s much smaller frame would be a cinematic miracle. Of course, there’s always the option of CGI or, better yet, letting Artificial Intelligence do the heavy lifting. In any case, we’re in for either a laugh or an Olympic-level performance, albeit one where the judges might need corrective lenses. Lastly, will Vilma Santos, the real-life mother of Luis, play Yulo’s mom, Angelica, in the biopic?",Entertainment

After an unexpected “reveal” during his latest Olympic attempt, a prominent porn site swooped in with a tantalizing $250K offer for Dupont to showcase his… assets. While millions enjoyed the unintentional peek for free, paying viewers might soon have to open their wallets to see the real thing. Critics argue this move could tarnish his athletic reputation, but let’s face it—pole vaulters aren’t exactly household names. Besides, how many medals can one buy with $250K? Ammirati’s dilemma is a true test of where the real value lies: in gold medals or golden opportunities.

Leading the charge was OVP worker and blogger Tio Moreno, whose relentless tirades painted the girls as villains in the latest airport drama. Ironically, his boss VP Sara Duterte pulled a BINI herself when she jetted off to Germany amidst the chaos of Typhoon Carina. Caught on camera, Duterte sported a face mask and a hooded sweater, missing only the “S” emblazoned on her chest – “S” for “Shukran!” Was it a fashion statement, or a desperate attempt to blend in with the crowd? As the nation recovers from the storm, we can only wonder if VP Sara will return donning a new persona, or if Tio Moreno will start his own line of face-obscuring gear.

In the age of honorary titles and political theatrics, quite a lot, apparently. Take First Lady Liza Marcos, recently designated as an honorary Auxiliary Vice Admiral with the Philippine Coast Guard. “Honorary” is the operative word here—an accolade that stirs the pot of public opinion. Critics rage that real service members earn their uniforms through blood, sweat, and sacrifice, while others wear them with less noble intentions, betraying their oaths. Then there are those who join the reserves, either through rigorous training or, let’s be honest, a few well-placed political connections. And who can forget the actors donning military garb for the sake of entertainment? In the end, a uniform is merely fabric and stitching.

Forget that we already have the Philippine Arena with its 55,000 seats; Clark Airport aims to double that, although it would still not be anywhere near the 132,000-capacity Narendri Modi Stadium in India. But what if—and here’s the twist—the stadium isn’t just for one night with Swift? What if the venue’s real purpose is for a future Pope Francis mass when he visits the Philippines? Imagine the outcry: “Why build a stadium for one mass?” The sensationalism would be off the charts! Or would it? It’s almost as if the Philippines is planning for something bigger, like a multi-use facility for both rock stars and religious icons. But who needs practicality when you can have hype?

He described the girls as “not beautiful,” hiding behind their masks. However, BINI, demonstrating wit sharper than Moreno’s misguided satire, arrived for their concert clad in identical hooded sweaters and full face masks. In an ironic twist, they effectively turned Moreno’s critique into a fashion statement. It appears Moreno underestimated the creativity of BINI and the amusement of the public, who watched as his own ridicule turned against him.

When she said, “Ang ating totoong sarili o pagkatao ay parang West Philippine Sea, hindi nila pwedeng angkinin at baguhin,” she perhaps forgot that the world community doesn’t officially recognize the West Philippine Sea. Much like a mystical island on the horizon, the West Philippine Sea was conjured up by former President NoyNoy Aquino in 2012 through Administrative Order No. 29. Yet, global geographical maps remain unshaken, and the West Philippine Sea endures mainly in the minds of a hopeful few. Unlike this cartographical phantasm, the realities of LGBT communities are vivid and undeniable. Vice Ganda’s comparison is poetic but perhaps misses the mark, because the existence and struggles of LGBT individuals are as concrete and undeniable as the seas that surround us, official recognition or not.",Entertainment

While America and Britain export cultural behemoths like “American Idol” and “Britain’s Got Talent,” the Philippines graciously offers its homespun tribute act. Surely, global audiences will be spellbound by this karaoke-like contest. But let’s be honest—perhaps the country would be better off shipping out its exquisite capiz shell crafts or mouthwatering canned adobo instead.

Surely, the network isn’t daring enough to think viewers can endure noon without Vice’s comedic chaos.

The absurdity of fake news reigning supreme is a testament to humanity’s penchant for embracing the ludicrous over the logical. Even the legendary Dolly Parton, adorned in anonymity, fell victim to the whimsy of appearance. She once anonymously joined a look-alike contest in Los Angeles.  She lost to a drag queen, proving that sometimes, a glittering facade can blind even the keenest eyes. So why bother with facts when fiction dances so seductively before us? After all, in a world where appearances hold more weight than substance, it’s easier to judge a book by its cover than to delve into the complexities of its contents.

When KathNiel breaks up, it’s not just a breakup; it’s a national tragedy, complete with memes and think pieces. As ordinary folks navigate their own tumultuous love lives, they look to celebrities for guidance, projecting their hopes and fears onto the glossy pages of showbiz magazines.

Perhaps he expected a profound revelation about the secrets of the cosmos. Yet, even if Dee had answered with the wisdom of a sage, one can’t help but wonder: who is Whang-od, and does anyone outside Abunda’s inner circle care? The judges would likely have scratched their heads, pondering the cosmic significance of a name lost in the black hole of irrelevance.

Is Broadway fatigued with the Marcos saga, or have theater-goers rejected the notion of a theater experience without plush seats? Perhaps the Great White Way isn’t ready for a show that challenges the hegemony of cushioned comfort. Could it be that American audiences, accustomed to Les Misérables-style epics, find “Here Lies Love” a bit too shallow and a tad too brown?

The disappointment among Noranians and Filipino film enthusiasts is palpable, as they were eagerly awaiting a rare opportunity to witness the magic of Philippine cinema’s true superstar. It’s quite the cinematic paradox when a festival that claims to celebrate the best of Filipino cinema manages to exclude one of the most iconic figures in the history of Philippine entertainment. It’s as if they’ve decided to hold a Lechon Festival without the actual lechon. How can we possibly have a meaningful discussion about the true queen of Filipino cinema without considering the astounding contributions of Nora Aunor? Instead, we are presented with a selection that includes the likes of the “Star for All Seasons” Vilma Santos and the “Mega Star” Sharon Cuneta. Now, don’t get me wrong; Vilma and Sharon have had their moments of glory, and they’ve given us some fantastic films over the years. But let’s not kid ourselves; they are but mere mortals compared to the celestial presence of Nora Aunor. It’s like hosting a “Who’s the Greatest Actor of All Time” contest and omitting Meryl Streep while throwing in a few Hollywood newcomers. Nora Aunor is not just an actress; she’s a national treasure, a legendary performer who has transcended generations. Her contribution to Philippine cinema is nothing short of monumental. The exclusion of “Pieta” from the festival is a blatant injustice, a cinematic crime of epic proportions. Nora Aunor is a national artist, for heaven’s sake!

The comedian had previously opened up about his plans of having a baby with Perez through a surrogate in an interview with former Manila City mayor Isko Moreno. After hearing of the couple’s plan, thousands of Filipinas have sent letters to Ganda offering their services as surrogates.  Some have even expressed their willingness to have a one-night stand with Perez just so the couple can finally realize their dream. Applicants have stated various reasons for their offer.  Some have said it would be a honor just to carry the baby of one of the most famous celebrity couples.  Others have revealed their sad stories, saying being selected as surrogate is the only way they know to uplift their dire financial need.

Religious group Philippines for Jesus Movement earlier sued Vega for his rock rendition of “Ama Namin,” or the Lord’s Prayer, which was denounced by many as “blasphemous.” Pagante was charged under Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code provides the penalty for “immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows.” It wasn’t clear whether Pagante would be posting bail for his temporary freedom.  What’s clear is that he’s fighting back! In a message sent directly to The Adobo Chronicles, Pagante said he is counter-suing the religious group, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines and Parish officials of Quiapo Church for immoral doctrines, idolatry and grave threat to public safety.  This is connection with the annual Traslacíon celebrating the feast of the Black Nazarene. “When I performed as Jesus, I was merely practicing my craft as an entertainer.  No one was physically hurt during my performance.  Nothing immoral about that,” he said. Pagante added: “What could be more immoral than a public display of idolatry, parading the Black Nazarene like a rock star, and putting the lives and safety of devotees at great risk?

Why bother the President for the mischief of the show hosts? Perhaps a more effective approach would be for Senator Revilla to ask the hosts of the show, particularly the wealthy Vice Ganda, to dip into their deep pockets and ensure that the workers receive their wages during the suspension.

With hosts prancing around in outrageous costumes, dancing to the same tired tunes, screaming, and laughing hysterically at their own jokes, these shows are a caricature of entertainment. They feed the masses a steady diet of shallow content, promoting mediocrity as the new normal. The obsession with celebrity gossip, love teams, petty drama and occasional insensitive and offensive banters overshadows the more pressing issues facing the country. While some argue that these shows offer an escape from daily struggles, they inadvertently foster a culture of ignorance. The incessant product placements and commercialism only serve to enrich the networks while viewers are left intellectually bankrupt. In the end, these shows might offer momentary amusement, but they also contribute to the long-term dumbing-down of the Filipino population.
