"On its “Independence Day”, the Philippines remains a sad and CONFUSED colony",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/on-its-independence-day-the-philippines-remains-a-sad-and-confused-colony/,"Today, the 12th of June, is the Philippines’ imagined “Independence Day” — the day when she unilaterally declared herself “independent” of her Spanish colonial master. That was not to be for long as history would go on to reveal. Way above Filipinos’ pointed heads as their “revolutionaries” patted themselves on their backs, Spain and the United States had already been negotiating the handing over of the little colony to the latter for a tidy sum of $20 million.
It remains debatable to this day whether the Philippines actually did become an independent state half a century later on the 4th July 1946 (the Philippines’ recognised independence day). Consider that for a moment and then take stock of what is happening in the Philippines today. Filipinos find themselves caught in a catfight between two dominant partisan camps today — the Dutertards loyal to former President Rodrigo Duterte and the Marcostards who are loyal to current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. The object of the spat? None other than which contemporary hegemon to latch on to.
On the right corner of the ring are the Dutertards and their continued attachment to the infamous (depending on who you ask) “pivot to China” of their cult leader. On the left corner are the Marcostards — this time joined by, well, leftist elements — who find warm fuzzy comfort in Uncle Sam’s familiar embrace. This quaint political squabble between incumbent and “Opposition” exhibits a microcosm of the intellectual bankruptcy that is the Philippines’ national “debate”.
Glaringly absent in this “debate” is a set of indigenous principles upon which can be put up as stable reference for what it means to be an independent Philippine Nation. This is because these “debates” are framed by nothing more than personal loyalties and, now, two flavours of colonial mentality.
The most disturbing aspect of this bipolar partisanism can be seen on the Left Corner — an emerging Axis of Intellectual Dishonesty that sees the “liberal” Yellowtards and extremist communists in bed with their historical arch-enemy: the “evil” heir to the Marcos Dynasty no less. The coagulation of this Axis affirms the colonial and financial power Uncle Sam continues to exert on Imperial Manila’s traditional oligarchy. The Philippines’ learning-impoverished population and citizenry of lazy thinkers provides fertile ground for a battle of hegemons’ ideologies and global agendas.
The Noted One himself observes in a recent Inquirer piece using, as context, the ongoing “investigation” into the ghostly background and personal circumstances of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo who managed to deftly navigate the Philippines’ convoluted bureaucracy to secure local political power despite her sketchy national origins…
Investigations so far have been racist in their lazy assumptions and breezy unwillingness to take into account the messy state of the documentation of many Filipinos, the different subgroups among Chinese Filipinos, and differences between Pogos’ and Beijing’s efforts to influence officialdom.
In short, left to politicians’ devices, investigations into critical issues and execution of essential imperatives are no more than means for these politicians to fulfill media exposure agendas or, worse, used as smokescreens to mask or distract the public from more confronting core truths about how things came to be. No surprise then that expensive and disruptive initiatives like these devolve into nothing more than public circuses that deliver no results.
Here is where we circle back to the old imperial dynamic — that of the hands global powers-that-be play in stirring up unimportant frenzies in societies populated by lazy thinkers and comprehension-challenged people. Colonial powers do what they do because they can. It’s all business and nothing personal — a fact that makes the immense emotional investment Filipino partisans and “activists” sink into their personal cult followings even sadder.",Others
Leila De Lima threatens to sue former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Will she succeed?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/leila-de-lima-threatens-to-sue-former-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte-will-she-succeed/,"Former Senator Leila De Lima, newly released on bail and now surrounded by Yellowtards, priests, and “journalists” is locked and loaded. “It’s reckoning time,” she reportedly crows — a battle cry made today’s top headline by no less than the Inquirer.
But of course, right?
But how much credibility as a practitioner of law does De Lima wield? This is someone, after all who seems to bow more to a foreign “court” than to the authority of the Supreme Court of her own country. This is evident in how, even today, she makes the International Criminal Court (ICC) a pillar of her threats against former President Rodrigo Duterte.
She also scoffed at the former president’s remarks against her after she voiced her support for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC).
ICC is investigating the previous administration’s campaign against illegal drugs.
Duterte previously said de Lima can “go together” with ICC, as he tossed the matter aside.
In reaction, de Lima asked, “Am I a human rights violator? Am I a killer, let alone a mass murderer?”
“Siguro ang ibig sabihin lang niyang ‘magsama-sama’ ay gusto lang niyang may makasama siya in that lonely cell at ICC,” she said in jest.
(Maybe what he means by ‘go together’ is that he wants someone to go with him in that lonely cell at ICC.)
Indeed, back in 2019, De Lima exhibited behaviour unbecoming of an officer of the judiciary which could even be regarded as grounds for disbarment. De Lima at the time had counted on an initiative being mounted by the US government back then to coerce the Philippines into releasing her from detention by banning Filipinos seen to be instrumental in her detention.
Think about it for a moment. The US is implementing a measure to ban Philippine government officials on the basis of someone’s opinion that they had “persecuted” Philippine Senator Leila De Lima. This is a position taken regardless of what any Filipino court has so far ruled. It just shows how, to Americans, the Philippines still remains a quaint little colonial outpost.
The Philippines’ Supreme Court at the time upheld a June 2018 ruling on De Lima’s arrest and detention on drug charges…
The high court denied “with finality” De Lima’s motion for reconsideration and said it would no longer entertain future pleadings or motions.
“…No substantial arguments were presented to warrant the reversal of the questioned decision,” the court said in a notice.
The Yellowtard-Communist Axis that make up much of the Philippines’ so-called “Opposition” nonetheless continue to make the ICC intervention into domestic affairs a pillar of their ideology. Old habits die hard and the Philippines today remains a laughingstock of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — the only country in the region that lacks an indigenous conviction robust enough to get over a historic fixation on its “victimisation” by former colonial masters. Today its “thought leaders” remain locked in quaint “debate” over which global power to cling to — United States or China — as camps use local politicians as proxies to organise themselves into polar cults of personality and loyalty to the day’s global hegemons; the administration of current President Bongbong representing the influence of Uncle Sam and the Duterte clan representing that of the People’s Republic of China.
Where does the influence of an independent Philippines fit in this picture? Well, what exactly these “thought leaders” mean when they drop the term “independence” is the subject of yet another idiotic Filipino-style “debate”. So let’s not hold our breath waiting for an answer to that last question.",Others
Makapili or Makabayan Part 2: The lies that brought the US military back to the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/makapili-or-makabayan-part-2-the-lies-that-brought-the-us-military-back-to-the-philippines/,"Philippine President Bongbong Marcos has adopted a pro-America foreign policy that was reportedly at the insistence of his cousin, Philippine Ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez. This has resulted in Marcos being received warmly in the US after he allowed American access to additional bases under the Enhanced Cooperation Defense Agreement (EDCA), all under the guise of civil and humanitarian assistance.
The US militarization of the Philippines, including expanding military joint exercises in contentious areas has only increased tensions in the disputed territories in the South China Sea, proving once again the “deterrence” that Babe Romualdez, Senators Risa Hontiveros and Juan Miguel Zubiri, and former Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, among others, used to justify more US military presence in the Philippine was a big lie to the public.
President Marcos initially promised the continuation of an independent foreign policy following his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte but, apparently it seems, that was also just lip service.
How many times did America betray the Filipino people?
If the US is really on the Philippines’ side, why is the US not escorting the Philippine Coast Guard in resupplying the WW2-rusting BRP Sierra Madre, or better yet replace it with a new one? Countless Filipinos died in Marawi, Mamasapano, and other conflict areas even with reported US military presence. Why did the US betray the Philippines’ claim to Sabah? If the said EDCA bases are to support Philippine interests, why are the US military bases surrounding Taiwan, instead of Sabah or the West Philippine Sea or in typhoon-prone areas like the Visayas region?
Any thinking person can see that these EDCA bases make the Philippines the target of America’s enemies, and only serve America’s agenda in containing and provoking China using Taiwan.
Are our politicians aware that over 500,000 people have died in the Ukraine-Russia conflict — a war instigated by the US and NATO — in less than two years? Or that millions have died in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and the national wealth of these countries taken over by US companies, after the US promised to “help” those countries.
Hijacking the President’s Powers
Like the “red scare” of McCarthyism of the US in the 1950s, Jonathan Malaya of the Philippines’ National Security Council (NSC), without any evidence, claims that there are Chinese operatives who are working with media personalities who are working with the Chinese in swaying public opinion in China’s favor. Then he would later say that the NSC is not participating in any witch hunt. Ironically Malaya had no qualms over Duterte’s China policy when he was a former undersecretary at the Department of Interior and Local Government. He also did not mention that Rappler, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), and Vera Files received millions from the CIA-linked National Endowment for Democracy (NED).
Jay Tarriela, spokesperson of Philippine Coast Guard, even called Filipinos who don’t blindly support the Marcos government’s policy in the West Philippine Sea as “unpatriotic” and “traitors”. He would later claim his statement was personal belying the fact that he makes the statement donned on his uniform in public platforms, perhaps a skill he learned from the time he was caught cheating in the Philippine Military Academy and even had the gall to sue the august institution.
Ambassador Romualdez, who has repeatedly praised Tarriela, has single-handedly hijacked the Constitutionally-mandated powers of the President to be the sole architect of Philippine Foreign Policy. Recall that Romualdez had the gall to agree with the US for the Philippines to accept 50,000 Afghans with the knowledge of President Marcos, whom Senator Imee had exposed and raised alarm over possible “American spies” who fled their Taliban-led country.
Marcos Pro-America Administration Isolating the Philippines in Region
What is incomprehensible now is the hate and vitriol being pushed against China when it has done nothing against the Philippine mainland and the Filipino people save for the “encounters” in the disputed areas in the South China Sea. China’s change in stance in the South China is a logical reaction to Marcos allowing the US to convert the Philippines into an American military aircraft carrier with missiles pointed at China.
At the recent Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Jakarta, Marcos pushed for the adoption of a resolution for a common stand to be taken by ASEAN member countries on the South China Sea disputes but it wasn’t adopted. There was no common statement against China and once again, the Philippines stood alone, exposed, as the American proxy in the region and within ASEAN.",Others
The Philippines as the Pariah in ASEAN,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/01/the-philippines-as-the-pariah-in-asean/,"The administration of President Bongbong Marcos is about to mark its second year in office but it still has not been able to make much headway solving the problems Filipinos face in their daily lives. Rice prices, for example, continue to accelerate with the cheapest at around P50.00 per kg, despite the supposed bumper crop in the last quarter of 2023.
The prices of other basic commodities remain high. Meanwhile, farmers have been dumping harvests of tomatoes and other vegetables because middlemen are not buying their crops for transport to Manila. The logistical bottlenecks continue to be a major reason why farmers and fishermen are among the poorest in the country.
While major economic problems hound the people, the focus of the Marcos administration continues to be on the South China Sea disputes and “security cooperation” agreements with Western-allied powers, practically isolating the Philippines within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) whose members continue to refuse to take sides between the United States and China. So far, ASEAN has not gone beyond issuing joint-statements calling for the reduction of tensions in the disputed areas and its diplomatic resolution.
Only the Philippines gave the Americans open access to military bases around its territory. These are supposedly for “civil defense” but, in reality, are staging areas for American military forces in the event of hostilities between the US and China over Taiwan. There are also increasing joint-maritime operations in the South China Sea between the Philippine and the US military.
More concerning is the latest news of the US Navy’s “clandestine” transfer of 39 millions gallons of fuel from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to the Philippines, as exposed by Senator Imee Marcos, who also warned about the “pre-positioning of military supplies in the country” as tensions flare in the region, which is only exacerbating the situation. The Philippines is evidently becoming an outlier in ASEAN. No less than Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Liong asked the confronting question: Is the Philippines wanting to get in the middle of a conflict between the superpowers that could turn the country into a battleground?
Before Marcos’s US pivot, the Philippines was one with ASEAN in negotiating a code of conduct in the South China Sea. Now, it is mounting a campaign to get the influential ASEAN members, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, to negotiate on a country-to-country basis, for an individual code of conduct in the South China Sea.
The Chinese have continued to assert their claims but have repeatedly said diplomacy should prevail in resolving pending issues. It has also reiterated its commitment to peace in the meeting between China’s Xi Jin Ping and US President Joseph Biden during the APEC Summit in San Francisco, where Xi also met with Marcos in the sidelines. Washington had Vice President Kamala Harris meet with President Marcos in a nondescript room also in the sidelines.
China continues to enjoy healthy relations with other ASEAN member countries such as Vietnam, which Xi Jin Ping visited last December. China is the top foreign investor in Vietnam. The same is true with Indonesia, with the Chinese-built high-speed rail system between Jakarta and Bandung by being inaugurated in 2023 as well.
Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are also benefiting from Chinese investment and soft loans for infrastructure projects. Laos is benefiting substantially from the completed Laos-China railway and Cambodia has two brand new international airports, all with China’s help. Thailand and China are continuing to study the feasibility of the Kra Canal, which would connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea and cut travel time by bypassing transit through the Strait of Malacca. The estimated project cost is $30 billion.
Empty promises for the Filipinos
So far, the Philippines has not received much except investment pledges from America and a renewed commitment from the US Millennium Challenge Corp. which is the State Department conduit for the US Agency for International Development. What Filipinos do not seem to notice is the Americans selling military equipment to the Philippines in the same manner it does to Taiwan to the tune of billions of dollars while over 50% of Filipinos cannot afford a decent living. All if this while Marcos repeatedly insists that he continues to try to find solutions to the everyday problems the average Filipinos face.
Despite the intensive efforts to make it appear that the administration is succeeding, a recent survey showed that Filipinos are not satisfied with the government’s efforts at controlling food inflation. There is also the effort to stifle freedom of speech as both government officials label critical thinking Filipinos who are not in favor of the pivot to the US as traitors or “Makapili,” the term given to Filipinos who collaborated with the Japanese during World War II. These politicians forget the fact that Japan and America bombed each other in the Philippines resulting in the deaths of over a million Filipinos. It’s doubtful that the same officials are willing to die for the country in the event hostilities break out between the US and China over Taiwan.
Stifling free speech and press freedom?
Sonshine Media Network International, more popularly known as SMNI, was investigated by a congressional committee on legislative franchises for possible violations because of its criticism of House Speaker Martin Romualdez and its supposed pro-Duterte and pro-China stance. SMNI has since been suspended by the National Telecommunications Commission, following a resolution from the same committee, pending an investigation.
The majority of the pro-US Philippine media has remained silent over the silencing of ordinary Filipinos and SMNI because of their desire to keep Filipinos on the side of the administration and the US.
A proxy for Uncle Sam
The Philippines is now in a peculiar situation again in the region having become an American proxy once again. It is about to conclude a visiting forces agreement with Japan which would allow Japanese troops in the country in the same way that American military personnel are actively operating. If the bases were truly for civil defense purposes, why would an American tanker carrying 39 million gallons of fuel be bound for Subic Bay from Pearl Harbor? Is this meant for storage in the old Hanjin shipyard which now houses a US base after Hanjin was bought out by American private equity company Cerberus?
The fate of the Philippines hangs in the balance between Uncle Sam and Marcos. The real question is, who really has the best interests of Filipinos in mind? This is despite the fact that the Americans have a long history of just using the country and its people to its advantage.
When will Filipinos learn that Uncle Sam only looks out for himself and not his proxies?",Others
"A Tale of Three Viruses: How Smallpox, the 1918 ‘Spanish’ Flu, and COVID-19 Changed the World",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/a-tale-of-three-viruses-how-smallpox-the-1918-spanish-flu-and-covid-19-changed-the-world/,"The history of human civilization is riddled with course-changing epochs in world history related to the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. I learned that important concept in evolutionary medicine when I studied evolutionary biology as a graduate student. Not only did we study the history of evolutionary theory, evidence for evolution, the origin of life, the origins of animals and the Cambrian explosion, genetic evolution, molecular phylogeny versus morphological phylogeny, genetic evolution, natural selection vs sexual selection, microevolution vs macroevolution, species and speciation, and human evolution but we also explored some of the most important evolutionary issues in modern medicine. We learned how medicine is, in fact a form of applied evolution, and the vulnerabilities of human body from an evolutionary perspective, considering disorders ranging from cancer, autoimmune disorders and allergies. We also explored how quickly pathogenic microorganisms can replicate inside and how they can be transmitted from one host to another by studying the evolution of virulence such as the ever-evolving seasonal flu that rapidly evolves each year, and processes such as viral reassortment that give rise to new genotypes. Such is the case with the 1918-1919 influenza that killed at least 50 million people worldwide. Evolutionary biology helps explain why it was so virulent and how scientists can prepare for new pandemics. As people became very mobile, their pathogenic microorganisms have gone along for a ride. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond leaves space for the microbes that swept the Aztec empire at the beginning of the 16th century in his seminal book, Guns, Germs, and Steel:
The importance of lethal microbes in human history is well illustrated by Europeans’ conquest and depopulation of the New World. Far more Native Americans died in bed from Eurasian germs than on the battlefield from European guns and swords. Those germs undermined Indian resistance by killing most Indians and their leaders and by sapping the survivors’ morale. For instance, in 1519 Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with 600 Spaniards, to conquer the fiercely militaristic Aztec Empire with a population of many millions… What gave the Spaniards a decisive military advantage was smallpox, which reached Mexico in 1520 with one infected slave arriving from Spanish Cuba. The resulting epidemic proceeded to kill nearly half of the Aztecs, including Emperor Cuitláhuac. Aztec survivors were demoralized by the mysterious illness that killed Indians and spared Spaniards, as if advertising Spaniards’ invincibility. By 1618, Mexico’s initial population of about 20 million had plummeted to about 1.6 million people.
Mr. Diamond also makes a compelling case for the powerful influence of geography and environment in world history. According to him, many discoveries and scientific breakthroughs helped transform kingdoms in western Europe into empires that spanned the globe at the beginning of the 16th century. Some Europeans ventured to distant countries to spread their faith or gain religious freedom, but most went in search for metals and other commodities that would enrich their lives and the monarchs they served. Conquistadores from Spain who ventured to the New World made Spain the world’s largest and richest empire in the 16th century. He also explained that, when conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro arrived in the New World, they brought with them new diseases such as measles and smallpox that were deadlier than their weapons. Their movements have brought diseases to people who were never exposed to them before. In some cases, the encounter has been devastating (Diamond, 1997).
We also learned in our class that, for many centuries, these devastating pathogenic microorganisms and their human hosts in Europe had been in a coevolutionary arms race. As a result, Europeans had some resistance to the disease. But when these pathogens arrived in the New World, they began to infect human populations whose immune systems had not been part of the arms race. Native Americans had no acquired immunity to diseases colonizers introduced, and no horses, firearms, or swords to thwart the invaders. The impact of Europeans on the natives was devastating. They wiped out an estimated 90 percent of the residents of North and South America in the first few decades after first contact with Europeans. If not for the coevolution of humans and pathogens, world history would have taken a different path.
The Perfect Storm
Four hundred years after Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico and brought their pathogens for the ride, another virus killed more people than any outbreak of disease in human history that originated from Haskell County, an isolated and sparsely populated county in Kansas, USA. In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond’s 2005 sequel to Guns, Germs, and Steel, he explores several cases to explain the complex interplay of different factors that affect historical outcomes, including environment and government policies, the role of the mass media and intelligentsia, political leadership, etc. The unprecedented fury of the First World War that convulsed the world is an eloquent example of Mr. Diamond’s broader approach to his wide-ranging research.
Every history buff knows that the First World War originated in the Balkans, where the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, a 19-year-old Serbian nationalist, caused conflict between Austria-Hungary and Russia, two troubled empire with powerful allies. The conflict pitted the Central Powers against the Allied Powers. When war broke out in 1914, Americans opposed the involvement of US troops, and President Woodrow Wilson declared the country’s neutrality. Whether the sinking of the passenger ship SS Lusitania or the interception of the United States of the “Zimmerman Note” had triggered a cascade of events that led to the United States to join the war, the Congress and President Wilson had to mobilize quickly to rally the soldiers and the citizens behind their war effort with the help of the mass media and the intelligentsia.
In Media Control –The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda, Noam Chomsky explained that the Wilson administration had to do something about it. When they established the Creel Commission (named after the former Denver Post columnist George Creel, a muckraker who spearheaded the first modern-day propaganda of the Wilson administration) in 1917, he was able to “turn a pacifist population into a war-mongering population.” Among those who participated actively and enthusiastically, Chomsky continues, were the progressive intellectuals, people of the John Dewey circle, who took great pride in having shown that what they called “more intelligent members of the community” namely themselves, were able to drive a reluctant population into a war by terrifying them and eliciting jingoist fanaticism. In Intellectuals and Society, Thomas Sowell describes the propaganda techniques used by these members of the intelligentsia. He contends that the Committee on Public Information, aptly described as “the West’s first modern ministry of propaganda” was created and run by Progressive George Creel, who took it as his mission to turn public opinion into “one white-hot mass” of support for the war, in the name of “100% Americanism,“ with anyone who “refuses to back the President in this crisis” being branded “worse than a traitor.” And, he continues, “while the public was being propagandized on a mass scale – by tens of millions of pamphlets and with ‘war studies’ created in high school and colleges, for example – a Sedition Act was passed which forbade ‘uttering, writing, printing, or publishing any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the United States government and the military.’”
These factors as well as the unprecedented world travel enabled the explosion and created a perfect storm scenario that enabled the spread of a deadly influenza strain.
How did the flu from Kansas spread across the world?
The “Spanish flu” of 1918-1919, which caused tens of million deaths worldwide, is a misnomer because the outbreak had originated in the United States during World War 1. Countries involved during World War 1 suppressed their press and withheld information from their citizens except Spain. When their king, Alphonse X111, fell ill because of the flu, the pandemic that swept across the world became known as the ‘Spanish Flu.’ However, different epidemiological studies have identified Camp Funston in Kansas as the origin of the influenza outbreak. As the story goes, sometime in 1918, a prominent doctor named Loring Miner started observing an especially severe flu that cropped up among his patients in rural Haskell County, Kansas (Barry, 2005). Miner had seen influenza before, and he knew it well, but this was different and he was shocked by what he saw (Zimmer, 2013):
This virus ravaged his patient’s bodies fast, and it killed, sometimes within a single day. An unusually virulent strain had evolved and begun to spread within the local community. Normally, this kind of outbreak would not get far before disappearing. By killing its hosts too fast, it should have driven itself extinct. But his particular virulent strain did not die out. That’s because America was going to war. The same week that Loring Minor’s patients fell ill, two recruits named Ernest Elliott and Dean Nilson took the train Haskell County to Camp Funston, the second largest training camp in the country. Within a month, thousands of soldiers were hospitalized with the flu and thousands more were treated at infirmaries throughout the base. All the while, troops were being shipped between camps, and from the camps to the European front. Two weeks after that, influenza outbreaks hit other training camps. By that point, the virus had spread with American troops to the trenches; from there it swept across Europe and then China, to New Zealand and Australia, and back again to the United States. As many as 100 million people would die before the 1918 flu pandemic came to an end.
But how did this strain evolve to be so deadly? Wartime conditions changed the nature of selection acting on the influenza virus, permitting the evolution and spread of an extraordinarily deadly strain. Because it was wartime, troops were moving on overcrowded ships to filthy battlefields. Furthermore, President Woodrow Wilson strictly enforced the newly enacted “Sedition Act” that prohibited any news considered “unfavorable to the war effort of the US government and the military.” Normally victims of an epidemic become bedridden in hospitals or home. As a result, they make relatively little contact with healthy people. But at the end of World War 1, wounded soldiers were being put on trains and ships, where they could infect other bedridden hosts (Zimmer, 2013). The viruses could replicate faster because they didn’t have to travel far to infect someone else. If not for the participation of the United States in World War I, the virus would not evolve and become more virulent and the world history would have taken a different path.
How the COVID-19 fares against the world’s deadliest pandemics in history
Too many political pundits, social media influencers, TV host analysts, pseudo- intellectual obscurantists, journalists and modern-day Cassandras surrender to the cognitive bias of assessing the world through memes, anecdotes and images rather than statistical analysis, data and facts when it comes to disseminating information about the COVID-19. The contagion of fear and panic they spread is more virulent that the contagion of virus itself. Fortunately, the virus turned out not to be like the 1918 pandemic because it was relatively mild in terms of virulence and fatality rate. Still, that was little comfort to the families of the estimated 278,000 people (as of March 21, 2020) who have contracted the virus and at least 11,570 who died of the strain, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. However, one of the characteristics of viruses is its ability to mutate at a high rate and change the nature of selection, permitting the evolution and spread of an extraordinarily deadly strain from human to human.
For example, subsequent pandemics have evolved every few decades after the reassortment (blending) of the 1918 flu virus such as the “Asian flu” of 1957-58 that killed 1.5 million people and the “Hongkong flu” of 1968-69 that killed 1 million people. These strains continue to circulate today but cause less mortality because human populations have developed immunity to them.
Nowadays, hundreds of thousands of people die each year in the United States alone from influenza but they don’t make worldwide headlines and create worldwide panic. However, the worldwide pandemic we have to worry more about and what experts really are afraid of is a new strain of flu that the human population has not been exposed to before, one that virtually everyone will not have any immunity against—one that scientists believe is worse than the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed tens of millions worldwide. Scientists recently discovered a triple assortant that mixed genes from classic swine flu with genes from bird viruses and human viruses. From our class, we also learned that even the most optimistic scenarios for how the next worldwide flu epidemic (pandemic) might proceed are grim. Experts believe that reassorted influenza virus can affect 20% of the world’s population, with close to 30 million people needing hospitalization, a quarter of whom will die. Pandemics result when a virus to which most people have no immunity, usually an avian strain, acquires the ability to transmit readily from animal to person, and then from person to person. This can happen by the virus mutating so that it can be passed between people, or it could exchange genes with a common human flu strain.
Case in point: In 2002, a mysterious new disease began to spread through China. At first, a Chinese farmer came to a hospital suffering from a high fever and died soon afterward. Other people from the same region of China began to develop the disease as well but didn’t reach the world’s attention until an American businessman flying back from China fell ill on a flight to Singapore and eventually died in Hanoi, Vietnam. The disease was given a new name: SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome (Zimmer, 2013). The outbreak of SARS almost triggered a global recession. Fear of the virus caused serious financial damage to businesses. During the height of SARS, nobody was going to restaurants and people didn’t want to go shopping. Estimates of economic impact ranged from $40 billion or so. If you’re looking for the economic impact of the current global pandemic, you’re looking at an impact measured in the trillions of dollars.  Experts now believe that the odds of a global recession are more likely to happen than it was a month or two ago when the COVID-19 swept across the world. What is scarier is that experts in epidemiology, public health and evolutionary biology had been warning us about a global pandemic for years and we paid a high price for not listening and heeding their advice.

Yet another anti-jeepney article: How Manila’s iconic Tranvia system was relegated to a mere historical footnote by Filipino “activists”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/yet-another-anti-jeepney-article-how-manilas-iconic-tranvia-system-was-relegated-to-a-mere-historical-footnote-by-filipino-activists/,"Indeed. We’ve written so many of them already, and yet here I am writing yet another one. To be fair, writing anti-jeepney articles is one of the easiest things. For some background on our proud tradition of anti-jeepney, check out this little animated GIF…
This animated GIF was hand-crafted by Yours Truly way back in 2000 — back in a time when criticising what were then pillars of Philippine society and culture, jeepneys included, was regarded as shocking. Our regard for many of these formerly shocking insights on Filipino culture has since been normalised and now form part of polite conversation: that Filipinos’ tropical culture predispose them to a lack of foresight; that Filipinos suck at saving, accumulation, and, therefore, capital expansion; that ours is an inherently unjust society despite it being constituted by an outwardly religious people; and that all these facets of Filipinos’ culture dysfunction find their collective embodiment in the jeepney.
Jeepneys, in short, represent everything that is wrong with the Philippines. Nonetheless, these derelict contraptions continue to apply an astounding grip on the sensibilities of the country’s foremost “thought leaders”. In a recent Rappler “report”, Isagani de Castro Jr presumes to compare jeepneys to vehicles that had become “cultural icons” in other countries.
Can you imagine the Philippines without its jeepney? Or Thailand without its tuk-tuk? Hong Kong without its Star Ferry? London without its double-decker bus?
These modes of transportation have become cultural icons in these places, and phasing them out would mean losing part of that territory’s soul.
It is interesting that de Castro, in his “report” also wrote about Japan’s streetcars and how, along with the other examples he cited above, gushed about how they are “prime examples of how cultural transport icons boost tourism”. De Castro failed to remind his readers that pre-war Manila had, itself, been known for its iconic streetcars. Manila’s tranvias have been cited as once-upon-a-time being the “envy of Asia”. Adrian Gamble wrote about these, at the time, “modern steam- then electric-powered streetcar and interurban rail service that once lined the streets of the Philippine capital” which “consisted of nearly 100 kilometres of track and carried more than 35 million passengers during its peak in the 1920s.”
By the 1920s and into the ’30s, the Manila Tramway became one of the most extensive tram networks in Asia, rivalling those in far more populated cities like Hong Kong (600,000 by 1930) and Tokyo (4,000,000 by 1930). Its 100-kilometre urban and interurban service carried a recorded 35 million passengers during its peak year in 1925. The tramway was a central part of the rapidly modernizing city, as the former colonial port town was growing up fast. The American influence and capital that had flowed into the Philippines following the US takeover brought with it a host of impressive Beaux-Arts and later Art Deco edifices, as a series of new office towers, government buildings, and train stations began to transform the Philippine capital.
To prop the jeepney up alongside historic public transport icons of other countries and leave out the one that actually holds a stronger claim to that pedestal attests to the selective “thinking” that Filipino “thought leaders” apply to their work. The way Filipinos habitually choose mediocrity over world-class achievement manifests itself today in how the Philippines lags far behind its peers in Southeast Asia in the development of modern mass public transportation. Why do Filipinos find such disturbing comfort in short-sighted solutions to their most profound problems. The mystery persists.",Others
Why Filipinos are More Enamored with America than with China,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/why-filipinos-are-more-enamored-with-america-than-with-china/,"It was reported that the Chinese Embassy in Manila has accused the United States (US) of stoking tensions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). Chinese Embassy officials further claimed that the US is doing this to advance its own geopolitical interest in the region. Of course, right on cue, Duterte sycophants, who are likened to a bunch of Beijing Kool-Aid drinkers, have marched to the drumbeat of the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo. So many articles and blogs are being disseminated by these Duterte worshippers that even Stevie Wonder could see their effort in shifting the narrative from Chinese aggression and encroachment of our territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the “White American bad boys promoting their self-interest at Filipino expense” from a mile away. Such nonsense idea that the whole conflict is merely about America’s “Proxy War” against China seems so glaringly obvious to favor the Chinese position (besides being factually and historically wrong). For a while I thought these Duterte worshippers were just being useful idiots. Now I realize that they are just plain idiots. However, despite going on overdrive with their pro-China messaging, Filipinos still trust the US the most when it comes to the WPS issue, among other things. China, on the other hand, is dead last when it comes to being trusted by Filipinos. Where might this awe of America over China be coming from despite America having lost to China when it comes to military and economic strength, as Davao blowhard, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (FPRRD) said?
I am not going to repeat my critique of the Duterte sycophants’ claptrap. I believe that I have already pointed out many flaws in their propaganda and the intellectual bankruptcy of the Chinese Brown-nosing Policy that their fentanyl-dosed deity seems to be championing. What I would like to dwell on are probable reasons why Filipinos still have a higher regard for America compared to China. Afterall, data shows that the US has the highest number of emigrants from the Philippines while China’s numbers don’t even appear on the radar when it comes to places Filipinos choose to move to. If Americans are so evil and dumb as what the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers seem to be pontificating, why do Filipinos choose to pursue the American dream over the promise of Chinese luck and prosperity? Why do Filipinos still seem to trust gas station sushi more than China?
Don’t get me wrong, I do not intend to minimize China or its contribution to our country. Afterall, how else can I afford to buy a matching Louis Vuitton belt and a pair of loafers for five bucks? How else can our beloved FPRRD continue (pain-free) with his incoherent rants against President Bongbong Marcos (PBBM) and America without China’s role in making sure fentanyl supply is flowing like the Niagara Falls? So, shouldn’t China’s great contributions and values be looked at more favorably than those dumb knuckle-headed fascist “American Imperialists”? What makes America so great in the eyes of the Filipinos? Let’s assess these Yankee characteristics, in terms of military strength, economic status, (scientific) intelligence, and cultural impact, shall we?
Military
Throughout history there have been a few countries that have dominated the world in terms of military strength. There was Egypt, Rome, the Mongols, Spain, France, Britain, and others. Presently, America has the most powerful military in the world. What separates America, especially in recent history, is its magnanimity after defeating its enemies. American military greatness is not just evident in its firepower but also in terms of its use of power. Case in point, after defeating Nazi Germany and after levelling Japan, America helped rebuild those countries. After World War 2, America’s military force remained intact as it had the most battle-hardened navy the world has ever seen, it possessed sky darkening clouds of B-29 bombers, and it possessed alone (at that time) the atomic bomb and the will to use it. The world was still licking its wounds from the war in 1945 and America could have conquered any recovering country in the world back then had it been the same as any other military superpower throughout history. But what did America do with the once in a lifetime military advantage it had? America actually scrapped many of its naval ships, drove steel bars through the wings of their B29 bombers and began the largest demilitarization process in the history of the world. It also sent billions of 1940s dollars (through the Marshall Plan) to its former mortal enemies to get them back up on their feet. This isn’t just a one-off but actually a pattern. In 1991, the US military routed Iraq and drove them away from Kuwait, a country invaded by then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. America could have taken the oil but what did it do? America helped Kuwait put out the fires that Saddam Hussein caused and went back home. Throughout the decades after World War 2, America has only gone to war in response to aggression and not to conquer or subjugate other countries (even though it could have).  On occasion the United States intervened in other countries like Grenada or Haiti or Bosnia, but it never stayed to rule those countries. Now what about China’s history of invasion? Did any Duterte sycophants ever fact-check Chinese Communist Party spokesperson Mao Ning for her claim that China has never invaded any country? Yeah, not holding my breath on that one. If China cannot be trusted for its whitewashing of its blemished history in terms of military aggression and invasion, can we really blame the Filipinos for distrusting the Chinese when it comes to respecting our sovereignty and sovereign rights?
Economics
America, by far, remains the largest economy in the world with $28.8 trillion US dollars in GDP and $85,370 in GDP per capita. The runner-up, being China, has $18.5 trillion US dollars in GDP and $13,400 in GDP per capita. Interestingly enough, America has 332 million people compared to China’s population of 1.4 billion people. Since the world’s population is roughly 7.9 billion, it is interesting to point out that despite America only having around 4% of the world’s population compared to China having around 18% of the world’s population, America still produces more than 1.5 times the GDP of second place China even with just a little more than 23% of China’s population. Sure, things like Lebron Nike shoes or Apple iPhones may be manufactured in China but the ideas to create such money-making products still come from America. In fact, America has been on top of the innovation age in recent history. There have been about three waves of innovation ages since recorded history. There’s the agricultural age, the industrial age, and now we have the Information Age. During the 19th century America became the world’s largest grain exporter. During the late 1880s to the early 1900s, America became the world’s leading industrial nation. Now in the Information Age, America leads the world in terms of global information and communication technology market share. Sure, your laptop or your iPhone may very well be manufactured in China, but it is still America who keeps most of the money. It is worthwhile to point out that it actually is where ideas come from that is important and that many of the innovative ideas that propel the world’s economy primarily comes from America. Is there really anything new that comes from China or are they just good in stealing technology and reverse engineering American innovation? I’ll leave that question for my readers to discuss. What is important to point out is that America is not just economically massive, but it is economically nimble as well. Filipinos often migrate to other countries for a better life. Given America’s economic success borne out of its creativity, innovation, and economic nimbleness, is it any wonder why America’s grass looks greener than the shrubs of China’s Gobi Desert?
(Scientific) Intelligence
So how many times have we heard that Americans are dumb? Social media certainly is replete with Americans deserving of the Darwin Award. We have American kids being shown on TikTok being clueless on what year the War of 1812 was, which state the State of Utah is in, or how many states make up the USA. But is it really true that Americans are stupid, and the Chinese are far more intellectually superior? So let us do a comparison of scientific output and impact of the two countries. America still leads the world in terms of the volume of scientific publications produced. The metrics remain consistent in terms of citable documents, citations, and if we look at citations per document China does not even come close to America’s numbers. Why is this information significant? We have to realize that each year, scientists around the world write research papers and these papers produce scientific citations which is tantamount to a measure of how much groundbreaking science is being performed and produced. From 1996 to 2023, America had more than 515 million citations whereas China only had 145 million. This means that America had more than 3.5 times as many as the country that the Duterte supporters glorify. Is this just me being an America worshipper? Maybe that is the case if there were no empirical evidence basis to support my argument. Unfortunately for the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers, the numbers are there for everyone to see. America, by far, still trounces China in terms of scientific intelligence and America is beating China’s butt even with just around 4% of the world’s population and only 23% of China’s. Even just looking at inventions, America is the hub of all innovative inventions as most new technology was invented in America. Just by comparing the numbers of patent grants alone from 1980 to 2022, America has received a total of 6,184,653 while China received 4,570,636. Wow! It sure looks like a rude awakening for the Duterte worshippers to see that the country they worship is actually scientifically inferior to the “nation of idiots” they love to bash and vilify.
Cultural Impact
In terms of cultural impact let us look at the comparison of the highest grossing movies of all time. Data shows that America, by far, has produced the most in terms of highest grossing films. In fact, most of the movies (if not all) in the Top 50 were produced in America. The highest grossing movie of all time in China, “The Battle of Lake Changjin”, did not even appear on the World’s Top 50 list. In terms of music, America still holds the most number of albums sold in the world with Michael Jackson lording it over the musical world.
I am not, by any means, discounting the talents of people outside of America. There certainly are a lot of people with amazing talent all over the world and China certainly has no shortage of talent. However, the most successful products that came from amazing talents mostly came from American production. Jay Chou, is the all-time king of Chinese music record sales, yet his most successful album does not even appear on the world’s all-time top list. Empirically speaking, America still tops the list of countries that have the most impact in international popular culture. Remember, such cultural impact to the world with America having just around 4% of the world’s population compared to China’s 18%.
Look, let us not unnecessarily stretch this any further, although we could as it is so much fun bursting the Duterte pro-China bubble. The point is that it is not surprising why Filipinos generally still look more favorably towards Americans and America compared to the Chinese and China. Am I merely drinking the American Kool-Aid here? Perhaps. However, the numbers actually do show that America still seems to dominate China in aspects that are a lot worthy of awe and respect. We have not even touched on the current geopolitical turmoil between China and the Philippines yet. A study by Mark Gabriel Wagan Aguilar reveals that the primary drivers for Filipino distrust towards China point to the perceived Chinese threat, their displayed aggressiveness, and superiority complex. But that is for another day to discuss.",Others
The Real Pawns,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/04/the-real-pawns/,"The recent scandal that shook the almighty kingdom of Duterteland seems to have triggered a slew of defensive social media posts from Former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s (FPRRD) sycophants. As recent news coverage has shown, FPRRD’s former spokesman Atty. Harry Roque revealed that FPRRD accepted a “gentleman’s agreement” with Beijing, when he was still president, to “maintain the status quo” that neither China nor the Philippines will move to conduct any improvements in the Ayungin Shoal. This agreement effectively limited Philippine vessels to only deliver water and food to our troops stationed at the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War 2 Era Philippine ship grounded there, and not any construction materials to fortify it. Dutertards have been quick to downplay the revelation saying that there was nothing secret about the deal. Missing in the Duterte narrative is the fact that the deal FPRRD made was already a tacit surrender of our legal position in Ayungin by acknowledging China’s terms. We’ll delve more into that later.
How did we really get into all this mess? Was it because of FPRRD’s boneheaded “gentleman’s agreement”? (Quite an oxymoron as FPRRD is hardly known to be a gentleman, but I digress.) Was it because of President Bongbong Marcos Jr’s subservience to America, as Dutertards seem to be pushing in their narrative? Was it because of the late former president Noynoy Aquino’s belligerent stance against China during his term? The answer to all the questions is a ‘No’. The issue started way back after the then-called Magic 12 senators led the country to saying ‘No’ to extending the US bases renewal in the Philippines in 1991. In a nutshell, there was enough anti-American sentiment to kick the US forces out of the Philippines back then. What was the root of the anti-American sentiment? Well, it was really mostly the left’s usual anti-“Yankee Imperialism” schtick. Sure, we’ll hear about “American atrocities” from previous wars (not just the from the Philippine-American War), as if America has only contributed evil and misery to the world and that its abusive nature is like a case of herpes that simply won’t go away. But at the end of the day anti-American sentiment just boils down to nothing but the jingoistic claptrap of “Americans Bad, Filipinos Good”. The very same thing that FPRRD and his sycophants have been promoting since FPRRD rose to power and up to now.
On December 21, 1992, the Military Bases Agreement with the US was officially terminated. Without American presence a power vacuum in the area was created. The next closest emerging power back then was China and sure enough, early in February 1995, the Philippines was caught off-guard by finding out that the Chinese has taken a territory that is within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Chinese forces were found present with a Chinese flag flying over the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef that is only around 200 kilometers away from Palawan. After the Mischief Reef invasion, another Philippine-claimed territory was invaded by China in 2012 – the Scarborough Shoal. In addition to the invasions, China also interfered with Philippine Oil exploration activities in the Reed Bank in 2011 as well as illegally built installations and artificial islands on Mischief Reef in May of 2013. Yes, this is the very same China that Sara Duterte has praised as generous to us in Mandarin and that Imee Marcos has claimed to have never attempted, in any way, to take us over.
So now that we have essentially lost control over Mischief Reef and the Scarborough Shoal, how should we deal with the China threat regarding Ayungin and the other territories in the area where we have a claim on? To his credit, Philippine president Noynoy Aquino led the Philippines against China in an international arbitral tribunal landmark victory where the Chinese claim over almost the entire South China Sea, through its self-defined 9-dash line (which has been upgraded to 10 or perhaps even 11 now). We know that this bogus China-defined line was largely overruled by the international tribunal. However, instead of building on the legal victory of Aquino, then new president Rodrigo Duterte decided to take a different tact by using a Neville Chamberlain-like Appeasement approach. For avid students of history, we remember how former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used such a diplomatic approach by making concessions to an aggressive foreign power (Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany) in order to avoid war. Chamberlain embraced this policy as the British people during the 1930s were desperate to avoid the slaughter of another world war (they just went through World War 1 just around a little more than 10 years prior) and that domestic issues such as the economy was deemed to be more important to focus on. But as history has shown us, the Appeasement approach was shown to be a failure because Nazi Germany’s expansionism continued, and British war engagement ended up being unavoidable. Nowadays, this Appeasement diplomatic approach is widely discredited but for some reason Duterte and the Dutertards still believe and insist that appeasing an aggressive and powerful expansionist China is the only solution to avoid a war.
So, under President Marcos’ approach of taking a principled stance of protecting our country’s national interest by working with other friendly nations that share common values and interests with us such as the United States, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, the EU, India, and many more, are we likely headed for war? The Dutertards seem hell-bent in making the people believe so. This is not entirely surprising as it is no secret that FPRRD and the Duterte partisans adhere to the anti-American sentiment, the very same sentiment espoused by those who kicked the Americans out of the Philippines in the early 1990s which created a power vacuum that led to our current predicament. Moreover, FPRRD and a few of the well-known Duterte sycophants are, or at least have been, beneficiaries of the graces of China. So, what is the connection between the war narrative being peddled by Duterte sycophants and the anti-American sentiments?
The Chinese Communist Party adheres to the Zhou dynasty era strategy taken from Sun Tzu’s book The Art of War called the 3 Warfares Strategy. This consists of: public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare. The idea behind this strategy is to win a war without firing a single shot but by merely using three fronts.
Public Opinion Warfare
This is currently being done by shaping public opinion using the all-too common anti-American (or anti-West) sentiment prevalent among the left and Duterte supporters. It basically serves as an all-too common read meat for a pack of wolves to be excited about. Infest the discussion about Chinese encroachment and aggression by invoking a favorite boogeyman, American intervention and prodding, and the whole issue shifts from China’s encroachment and aggression to America merely using the Philippines for its own selfish interest. Then of course, once Filipinos see America as the bad guy then the old adage applies: “The enemy of my enemy, is my friend”. Before you know it, we’ll all be joining VP Sara Duterte in unison.
Psychological Warfare
China has, and continues to intimidate its competitors, using its military’s image of size and strength. They flaunt their huge naval fleet and military power to give everybody a scare. The aim, of course, is to undermine our ability to conduct combat defense and deterrence operations by shocking and demoralizing our military personnel and supporting civilian populations. But if a country’s leader is dumb enough to cower in fear just like Duterte, then China already gets a huge upper-hand. A leader projecting a submissive stance by saying: “Do you want war against China? I’ll tell you, even on the coast beach of Palawan, before you can take off, the missile of China would be there in about five or 10 minutes. It would be a massacre if I go and fight a war now. We are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side.”  Even if it is true that our military strength is no match against China’s, the projection of submissiveness and weakness from a leader affects the morale of his troops. The reason why China loves Duterte is because Duterte’s pusillanimous mindset plays perfectly well into their strategy.
Legal Warfare
China has used, as its legal basis, its historical ownership of the South China Sea. As US Major Morgan Martin of the US Naval Institute correctly said:
The PRC’s psychological and legal warfare activities go hand in glove and are focused heavily on the South China Sea. Alleging historical ownership, China has claimed several islands in the region, ignoring protests from neighboring countries and international tribunal rulings to the contrary. The area has significant untapped oil reserves and is a major global trade route; gaining exclusive control of the South China Sea would contribute a great deal to the PRC achieving regional and global hegemony. The ways it has attempted to do so are prime examples of psychological and legal warfare in action.
The PRC initially used legal warfare in the South China Sea by appealing to international legal bodies to legitimize its territorial claims. When those bodies have rejected the claims, the PRC has branded them as illegitimate and refused to abide by their findings. This ultimately undermines the legitimacy of these bodies and decreases stability in the region, as neighboring nations become more uncertain of the legal status of the South China Sea.”
Unfortunately, the Philippines had a president from 2016 – 2022 who willingly served as China’s useful idiot by even supporting China’s sore-loser tantrum when he said: “They (Aquino administration) filed a case, we won. That paper, in real life, between nations, that paper is nothing. …  Actually, in street parlance, I would tell you, ‘Give that to me? Son of a bitch, that’s just a piece of paper. I’ll throw it in the wastebasket.”
So, is President Bongbong Marcos Jr.’s approach going to lead us to a war we cannot win and where our mutual defense treaty partner, the United States will simply leave us out to twist in the wind? The Duterte sycophants seem to be going overtime in pushing for that narrative. Sure, there is always a possibility of the worst outcome, but probability is another question. How probable is an armed warfare with China be? Would it be in China’s best interest to trigger the US-Philippine mutual defense treaty should it decide to pulverize the Philippines with its powerful army and weapons? So, from dealing with a small country with an inferior armed force, what benefit will China gain if its action will escalate the situation by having a powerful nation with around 10 times more nuclear weapons than it has, enter into the mix? That is just the United States, what about our other allies that President Marcos has gained who expressed willingness to support us with our territorial defense? So far, the Philippines has the United States, the EU, Japan, Australia and about 16 other countries that have expressed support to the Philippines and the rule of law. To get into a war with the Philippines will further risk China into further isolation on the world stage. Despite its belligerence regarding its loss on the international arbitral ruling against the Philippines, it recognized that international law is not on its side! That is why it has resorted to gray-zone attacks against the Philippines to keep things from going to a full-scale war. If it really was intent on war China certainly has the capability of pulverizing the Philippines in less than a day. But it hasn’t and it likely won’t precisely because there are too many factors at play that may make things a lot riskier and a lot worse for its situation. The 3 Warfares Strategy is what it has chosen and continues to play. Unfortunately, we have FPRRD and the Duterte sycophants who seem to be acting as unwitting agents for the Chinese Communist Party to carry out at least some components of its 3 Warfare Strategy.
It is quite refreshing that we now have a president who is taking a principled stance with regards to protecting our country’s EEZ. The agreement that President Marcos Jr.’s predecessor made with China was essentially a tacit surrender of our ownership of the Ayungin Shoal. Former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio said: “President Duterte knew that without repairs, the BRP Sierra Madre would soon collapse and, thus, end our presence in Ayungin Shoal, … Yet Duterte agreed, in a concession to China, that the Philippines could only bring food and water to BRP Sierra Madre and would not bring materials to repair the Sierra Madre. … Duterte’s ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ was lopsided in favor of China… That ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ was a disguised surrender of our EEZ rights over Ayungin Shoal as it gave China veto power over our exclusive right to erect structures on Ayungin Shoal”.",Others
Donald Trump’s rallying cry is now “Fight!” — just like that of the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/donald-trumps-rallying-cry-is-now-fight-just-like-that-of-the-yellowtards/,"In an ironic twist of fate, former United States president Donald Trump is now basking in the limelight following his survival of an assassination attempt over the weekend. The Colonial Master’s politics now mirrors the necropolitics of its Mini-Me in southeast Asia — except that the beneficiary of the violence lived to fight on. CNN reports…
With a white bandage over the ear clipped just two days earlier by an attempted assassin’s bullet, Donald Trump stole the show when he made his first public appearance since the shooting on the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
Trump joined the man he’d chosen hours earlier as his vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in a box in the 10 p.m. Eastern time hour for Monday night’s final speeches.
The crowd chanted “fight” — the word a bloody-faced Trump had shouted several times, while pumping his fist in the air, as the Secret Service rushed him off the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.
It was just a small eternity ago that a similar “fight” (Laban!, in Tagalog) rhetoric created the cringy political mythology that would plunge the Philippines in an idolatrous stupor that would go on to span more than three decades. The assassination of former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 set the stage for the ouster of then President Ferdinand E. Marcos and usher in the Philippines’ Yellowtard era. This was an era of limp-dicked nationalism characterised by martyrs-as-hero idols (chief of whom was the now-late former Senator), the release of communist rebels many Filipino soldiers worked hard to track and capture, the accelerated decline of the Philippine military’s fighting capability, and the erosion of Filipinos’ English language proficiency.
Interestingly, there seemed to be no real will to walk the “fight” in the Yellowtard talk. For that, the Yellowtards relied on their chums in the New People’s Army  (NPA) — the terrorist arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines —  to walk their talk. Not that the NPA were any more effective. The NPA had evidently seen the back of their glory days and, in recent years, languished as a sad nuisance side show in the Philippines. To cite a recent example of the lameness of the Yellowtard “fight”, the campaign of former Vice President Leni Robredo who put in a competing bid for the presidency in the lead up to the 2022 elections flew a pink banner and used misguided gender ideology as pillars to their efforts to woo what remains an essentially conservative society. Not surprisingly, that whole approach failed catastrophically.
So now Filipinos now find Father America on a similar boat. But this time it is the “bad guys” who are deftly engineering a public perception that is making the liberals shit their pants. Even more ironic, they now call for unity as Reuters reports…
U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity.
Within hours of Saturday’s shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications, including those that had highlighted Trump’s May felony conviction in New York state court relating to hush money paid to a porn star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 U.S. election.
“We must unite as one nation,” Biden said in White House remarks on Sunday, adding he would have an Oval Office address in the evening. Biden condemned political violence again, as he did on Saturday night, and asked Americans to “let the FBI do their job.”
The US has turned into Bizzarro Philippines — the Republicans shouting Laban! and the Democrats calling for “unity”.",Others
CIA hijacks Philippine foreign policy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/cia-hijacks-philippine-foreign-policy/,"The Philippines is now focused on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), with the expanded agreement covering access to an additional four Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) facilities and the expansion of an airstrip in the Balabac Island group in Palawan. It was Philippine Ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez who made the announcement, not the President and not even Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo.
President Bongbong Marcos is supposed to be the chief architect of foreign policy but there are many who are inclined to believe that Romualdez is in-charge, vice Manalo, who is also unabashedly, pro-US.
The Philippines and the US recently concluded a two-plus-two one-on-one meeting between US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with their Philippine counterparts, Enrique Manalo and Carlito Galvez last March. This was also under the auspices of Romualdez but what observers noted was while the US was able to obtain much concessions from the Philippines, the latter wasn’t able to receive the same in return, primarily on the efforts of the Philippines to access a bigger piece of America’s market. The US betrayed the Philippines again.
Did Ambassador Babe Romualdez fight for the Philippine interest as hard as he fights for US military interests in the Philippines?
Filipinos Collateral Damage for US Interest
While Marcos continues to enjoy popular support coming off his record win at the polls in May 2022, critical-thinking Filipinos are wary of his pivot to the US given the risk involved in provoking retaliation from China through increased tensions in the disputed waters in the South China Sea and the fact that China is the top trading partner of the country, and major partner in infrastructure development.
All of these developments are coming on the heels of the perceived weakening of the US with its failures in Iraq and Afghanistan and the largely ineffective sanctions on Russia, which has been relying on the advice of Iran for ways to go around the American ban given they have been under the same regime since 1979.
It doesn’t help that the US trade sanctions on China have had the effect of fueling anti-American sentiment in key regions around the world. China has brokered a semblance of peace between the Saudis and the Iranians. The same is true with Syria. There are also African countries which have announced their disengagement with their former colonial rulers such as France. There have been widespread protests in France and Germany against NATO support for Ukraine and the continuing escalation of inflation in the continent due to US and NATO sanctions on Russian energy exports.
By far the largest elephant in the room which remains unaddressed is the bombing of the Nord Stream pipeline and subsequent expose by prominent American journalist Seymour Hersh that the US was behind it.
How Many Filipinos Will Die for America?
The Philippines was on the wrong side of history when the Pacific War broke out, leading to over a million Filipinos perishing. But those were circumstances beyond its control because it was the subject of horse trading between the declining Spanish empire and the rising American empire.
Pax Britannia ended after World War II. Pax Americana began with the Monroe Doctrine and continued with the ascendancy of the US during the Cold War and the fight against the spread of communism in Asia.
Another million Filipinos died in World War 2, Japan and America fought each other in the Philippines and obliterated Manila.
While America continues projecting itself as fighting for good versus evil, it has created far more deaths and destructions since WW2, and had turned nations into warzones many remaining so to this day. American economic and financial hegemony through the dollar is ending and this development is too serious to just sweep under the rug and say that in the end, America will still emerge triumphant.
But we need to keep a close watch on the pro-American cabal surrounding BBM. They have his ear and he has been dancing to the tune they’ve been playing even before his inauguration. If the government and the AFP isn’t going to protect the people as provided for in the Constitution, then we, the people, have no other choice but to protect ourselves.
Is Babe Romualdez the Filipino Edward Lansdale?
One can’t help but compare Romualdez to Edward Lansdale, the former US Air Force officer who was the Central Intelligence Agency’s resident chief in the Philippines after World War II. It was Lansdale who engineered the rise of Ramon Magsaysay to the Presidency. Many believe he was also behind Magsaysay’s death in a plane crash in Cebu.
Lansdale also worked with the AFP in counter-insurgency operations against the Huks. Lansdale was believed to have recruited Ninoy Aquino as a CIA operative. The same is true with Ninoy’s close friend, Max Soliven, who attended college at Fordham University in New York. Soliven and Romualdez became close after the Marcos’ fall from power.
The crowning move, as it seems, has been secured, with the announcement that President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. will be embarking on a working visit to the US in May with a meeting in the White House with key officials led by President Joe Biden and top members of his Cabinet.",Others
Is the Philippines the Looming Ukraine of Asia?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/is-the-philippines-the-looming-ukraine-of-asia/,"Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos welcomed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a one-day visit to the Philippines after he spoke at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore which Marcos attended last week as the keynote speaker.
The visit drew a comparison at the situation of Ukraine, which is seen by geopolitical analysts as engaged in a proxy war for the US against Russia.
In less than two years, the war between Russia and Ukraine has killed and injured over 500,000 people, major cities have been bombed to the ground, and the long-term damage to infrastructure is incalculable.
Zelenskyy led thousands of his people to death and destruction of his country
More than 10 million people have been displaced, with over 6.3 million seeking refuge outside Ukraine. While Zelenskyy claims victory, he has to go begging for more money from Western-allied countries after over 500,000 people have been killed or injured, this is not including the millions in Ukraine who face severe hardship, especially during winter, due to the damage to essential services like heating, electricity, and water supply. Zelenskyy has also lowered the army draft age from 27 to 25, increased the penalties for those who refuse to join the war, and banned elections and persecuted opposition groups including the media.
Economic impact of war in Ukraine
Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) has shrunk by 25% since 2022 and now suffers a budget deficit of 23% of GDP (excluding grants). The Ukrainian Hryvnia has depreciated by 21% against the US dollar. Ukraine’s debt to GDP increased from 49% in 2021 to 85% today. Approximately 40% of Ukraine’s electricity-generating capacity destroyed since the war began. Russia currently has taken control of about 41,000 square miles (17.5%) of Ukraine, including territory occupied before 2022. These statistics highlight the extensive and ongoing suffering of the people created by the conflict with long term painful impact for both Ukraine and the broader international community.
Is the Philippines becoming an outcast in ASEAN?
Marcos’s speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue drew mixed reactions from political and policy experts because of the conflict in his statements about Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality and the balancing act member states are subject to between the US and China. Ironically, not a single ASEAN member has come out in support of Marcos’s policies in the South China Sea with regard to the disputed areas and the pivot to the US of the Philippines which has resulted in the trilateral alliance between the US, Japan and the Philippines. On the contrary, Singapore’s Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysia’s Anwar Ibrahim have warned of the dangers that the track the Philippines has undertaken under Marcos administration.
Unlike his predecessors, Marcos has given unfettered access for the US military to build bases around the Philippines, including in Cagayan province, facing Taiwan which China has repeatedly said is a red-line.
In contrast, ASEAN has continued bilateral discussions and expanded cooperation with China.
The Philippines has again adopted a policy of hostility against China similar to the policy of the Aquino administration, which resulted in the loss of Scarborough Shoal during the stand-off with China in 2012. Ironically, the loss of Scarborough was due to the US betrayal of the Philippines because Albert Del Rosario and Jose Cuisia “trusted” the US, and allowed the US to negotiate with China without the Philippines at the table.
The Ongoing South China Sea dispute between the Philippines and China’s significant economic implications
China is the Philippines’ top trading partner, with trade valued at $87.7 billion in 2022. However, in the first nine months of 2023, trade fell by 16% to $54.1 billion. Our trade officials attribute this to an overall slowdown in regional trade, but it cannot be discounted that, if bullets start flying, business will be significantly affected.
The decrease in Chinese tourist arrivals to the Philippines is felt more significantly by the local and provincial economies that depend highly on foreign spending.
China also quickly became the second largest source of foreign tourists to the Philippines reaching almost 1.7 million in 2019. Chinese tourists are known as the top buyers of luxury goods and accommodations worldwide, and that’s why many countries in the world are extending additional efforts to attract more Chinese tourist.
But Chinese tourists visiting the Philippines dropped to 263,000 in 2023, according to the Department of Tourism.
While the decrease may be partly due to China’s economic slowdown in the aftermath of the pandemic, there are also reports that the Philippines has made it harder for Chinese nationals to obtain visas during the Marcos administration, prompting Chinese tourists to go to other ASEAN countries, with less restrictive visa requirements. After all, any thinking person would ask: Why would you spend your money on a country that keeps provoking you?
While some of our politicians warn of a looming Chinese invasion, South Korea and Japan are putting more Chinese signs in their shops and even hiring Mandarin-speaking staff to prepare their countries for the expected resurgence of Chinese tourists. Chinese visitors to South Korea and Japan totaled about 2 million and 2.5 million Chinese tourists respectively. In 2023, Thailand attracted 3.5 million Chinese tourists, Vietnam had 1.75 million, and Singapore had 1.4 million. What is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Tourism doing about this?
Despite the numerous foreign trips Marcos had undertaken since he assumed office, foreign direct investment is still not even close to the levels attracted by other ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Despite the closer relationship with the US, tech giants Google and Microsoft opted to put their money in Malaysia over the Philippines. Philippine ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez boasted of billions in economic investments from the US. To this day, these are no where to be seen. Are we being fooled again?
The West is abandoning Ukraine after using it as a pawn against Russia
With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians dead and his country turned into a wasteland, Zelenskyy has to go around the world begging for support, a clear sign of dwindling US backing. Zelenskyy invited Marcos to the upcoming Peace Summit in Switzerland, which was accepted. The peace summit has been criticized by many experts for not inviting Vladimir Putin considering he is the president of Russia. Did anyone ask how can it be called a peace summit when the other party in the war is not invited?
Ironically, after Zelenskyy’s invitation was accepted by Marcos, the White House announced that President Biden will not attend the summit and that Vice President Kamala Harris would attend instead.

The Senate: a political institution that lost its luster,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/the-senate-a-political-institution-that-lost-its-luster/,"The Philippine Senate is a political institution that was created during the American occupation years. Also called “the upper house”, the Senate is a legislative body that can be traced back to the Philippine Commission, which was created to assist the Americans in administering government powers in the Philippines. According to the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Senate is composed of 24 senators, where 12 seats will be up for grabs every three years. A senator can only serve two consecutive six-year terms, for a total of 12 years. As senators are elected by the whole country, it requires candidates to be immensely popular as the electorate votes for 12 senators every three years.
Aside from its legislative responsibilities, the current constitution grants additional powers to the members of the Senate. Senators are needed to complete the Commission on Appointments, where approval is required from the aforementioned commission before department secretaries and ambassadors officially assume their duties in their respective departments or foreign posts. The Senate also has the ability to impeach the president and the chief justice, albeit requiring the House of Representatives’ (lower house’s) consent. In addition, the Senate ratifies treaties signed with other countries, whether bilateral or multilateral in nature. These strong powers granted by the constitution to the Senate provide an impression that, ideally, the upper chamber must be filled with respectable, competent, and dignified individuals who are committed to defend the interests of the Philippine archipelago and of the Filipino people. However, reality seems distant to what is ideal.
The current political reality is that, the Senate is no longer the political institution that it should be. This can be seen when one keenly observes and contextualizes the general and midterm elections held from 1992 until 2022. Three decades’ history of electing senators reveal patterns that put a spotlight light on how feeble and fragile political institutions are in the Philippines. With such, there are two election observations that must be noted vis-à-vis the Philippine Senate.
The first observation is that, the winning candidates who garner the most number of votes are usually showbiz or media personalities, or candidates who are directly related to these individuals The exemptions would be the 1995 elections with current Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 2016 elections with then-Senator Franklin Drilon, and the 2019 elections with current Senator Cynthia Villar. However, in the 2016 senatorial elections, Senator Tito Sotto ranked third, while current Senator Grace Poe held to the second position in the 2019 elections. This leaves the 1995 senatorial elections as the only genuine exemption to such generalization.
The second observation is that, the Senate is becoming a mere launching pad for politicians who eye higher positions in the next general elections, which are the Offices of the President and the Vice President. In the 1992 elections, then-Senator Joseph Estrada became Vice President and in the next general elections, he won the presidency with then-Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo occupying his previous position. In the 2004 elections, the ticket of Arroyo-de Castro emerged victorious, who both had legislative experience as senators. In 2010, then-Senator Benigno Aquino III won Malacanang and, last year, Ferdinand Marcos Jr cruised his way to a landslide victory for the country’s top position after also serving as a one-term senator. Only the 2016 general elections would serve as an exemption, as both then-Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and then-Camarines Sur Representative Ma. Leonor Robredo held no position in the Senate. Aside from the eventual winning candidates and then-Vice President Jejomar Binay, the 2016 elections were crowded with senators who ran for higher office.
Connecting these two observations regarding Philippine electoral results together, it becomes evident that the Senate is no longer the illustrious political institution that it was initially meant to be. Gone are the days when Filipino luminaries like Miriam Defensor Santiago, Juan Flavier, Blas Ople, and Joker Arroyo, who exemplified competence, genuine public service, and a solid understanding of Philippine realpolitik graces the Senate halls. Unfortunately, the senate has degraded and become a stark reflection of a deeply-embedded oligarchy and oligopoly that stubbornly resists political reform. However, these politicians cannot be blamed completely because the current political system of the Philippines incentivizes them to lean more towards popularity instead of competence. Luckily, the Philippines can learn from world history through the successes of the Roman Senate and the United States Senate, which are political institutions that played significant roles in nation-building.
Albeit different from its legislative powers that are associated with modern upper chambers, the Roman Senate served as a governing body from the formation of the humble Etruscan city-state of Rome until the eventual disintegration of the Roman Empire. The changing powers of the Roman Senate reflected the economic, political, and social realities that Rome has faced, where the aforementioned political institution served as the basis for the Romans in creating a strong state. Despite its shortcomings, the Roman Senate allowed itself to undergo structural reform and surrender some of its powers due to external pressures. This allowed the Roman state to effectively and efficiently respond to national exigencies which allowed the Roman civilization to last for more than a millennium.
On the other hand, the American Senate, which serves as the other half of the bicameral legislature of the United States, roughly plays the same roles and is afforded similar powers to that of the Philippine Senate. However, what sets the United States Senate apart from its Philippine counterpart is its structure. The current American Senate is composed of 100 senators, where each state is represented by two senators, who in turn are elected by their state electorate. Despite qualms over proposals to adjust the numbers of senatorial representation that would reflect their respective demographics, the two senators per state structure was designed to avoid tyranny of the majority. If it wasn’t the case, the sheer numerical superiority of the states of California, Texas, Florida, and New York can easily silence the interests of Vermont, Alaska, Delaware, and Wyoming.
Looking at the cases of the senates of Rome and the United States, the Philippines’ upper house must definitely undergo political restructuring. Ideally, the Senate must be an institution that acknowledges and works toward the protection and promotion of Philippine national interests, but the reality seems to be far from it as it has merely become a bastion of political ambition. How can representative democracy work in the Philippines when the upper chamber is predominantly represented by individuals hailing from Luzon and Metro Manila? Will these senators understand the hardships of the heavily-marginalized regions and provinces of the Philippines? If Filipinos desire political reform, most specially in the senate, it begins and ends with charter change.",Others
The only argument the Yellowtards and commies have against Bongbong Marcos is that he is a Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/the-only-argument-the-yellowtards-and-commies-have-against-bongbong-marcos-is-that-he-is-a-marcos/,"If there is anything that encapsulates just about all of what the Opposition has to argue against the recently-announced candidacy of former President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., it is the headline given to this Rappler piece authored by Lian Buan: “Dictator’s son Bongbong Marcos to run for president in 2022”. Being an avowed “social news network” in the service of the Yellowtards (the Opposition bloc of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) it is only fitting that Rappler‘s girlette frame her “report” around the only argument in the Opposition brains trust’s intellectual arsenal against the most winnable of this election cycle’s presidential bets.
Buan’s writing is fully in-character…
Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, will run for president in 2022 – in a move that aims to complete the family’s return to power 35 years after they were ousted by a civilian-backed military revolt and forced to flee the country.
Indeed, the whole of Yellowtardom owe their existence to this narrative of Filipinos having to be in a perpetual state of “vigilance” so as to ensure that the “horrors” of the “Marcos years” are to “never again” happen. Perhaps it is high time that these presumed “leaders” of the Opposition pause and reflect. If that whole premise remained as compelling as it once was 20 to 30 years ago, why do they now tremble at the prospect of “another Marcos” in Malacanang? Maybe it is possible that Filipinos have just had enough of all that shrill fear mongering.
The Yellowtards, it seems, would like to keep Filipinos imprisoned by this engineered fear forever. They regard Filipinos as idiots who need to be “protected” from their own curiosity lest they wander too far away from the bahay kubo. This they do by filling their minds with dishonest tales of the terrible tikbalangs and kapres that lurk in the forest.
In light of Bongbong Marcos now being in the race for the presidency, the Opposition need to confront the important question: Does “another Marcos” in Malacanang necessarily presuppose a return to authoritarianism? Consider too Marcos’s qualifications using sheer experience alone as the key metric. Buan herself points out; “Marcos has been in government for 28 years, starting in 1980 when he became vice governor of Ilocos Norte at age 23 and his father was president under Martial Law. He won as governor and representative of Ilocos Norte before serving as senator for one term from 2010 to 2016.” How do Buan’s preferred presidential candidates measure up to that? Indeed, the next most popular candidate could not even complete one gig as Mayor of his home city before setting his eyes on the top job. What’s up with that, right?
And then there is that election — the one that Yellowtardom’s Joan of Arc, Leni Robredo, supposedly barely “won” against Marcos. If Robredo had really been as popular as Marcos was in 2016, why does she consistently trail just about every one of her rivals in just about every reliable poll over the last several years? This, even as the same sample sets show Marcos consistently sustaining his numbers throughout. It’s one of those things that make you go “hmmm…”. As in, hmmmm… who really won the vice presidency in 2016? The mystery persists, specially so that then Commision on Elections (COMELEC) chairman at the time, Andy Bautista, remains holed up with his relatives in the United States refusing to face the music.
Remove the whole “Marcos is evil” ululation from the Yellowtard rhetoric and what does that leave them in a face off with Marcos in a debate? Big fat ZERO. It raises yet another important question: Shouldn’t Filipino voters expect more of their Opposition than the tired old “Marcos is evil” strawman that they’ve been hiding behind all these years? Certainly it is high time that more forward-looking minds be applied to the political “debate” — a debate the Yellowtards would like to blanket with the emotional blackmail they had been perpetrating against the Filipino people for no less than three decades.",Others
Philippine “nationalism” torn by Filipino partisans’ rabid loyalties to China and America,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/philippine-nationalism-torn-by-filipino-partisans-rabid-loyalties-to-china-and-america/,"Is the face of the new nationalism against China also a false one? The question should be asked and answered because as Randy David stated in his Inquirer column “Against China: The face of a new nationalism”, his generation’s nationalist bent was directed against the US and not China. “I never thought there would come a time when Filipino nationalism would be trained explicitly against China, rather than its usual target, the United States,” David writes. He then wistfully recalls the “heady” days of his youth…
Coming of age during the impetuous years of the ’60s, my generation had formed its signature activism in the struggle against the complex machinations of American imperialism. As undergrads at the University of the Philippines, we spent as much time in teach-ins outside the classroom as in our formal classes, discussing the reality of the US war of aggression in Vietnam and the role that the American bases in Clark and Subic played in the conduct of that unjust war.
When the battle was still ideological, National Democrats sided with China because they believed that communism was the solution to society’s problems. China even sent arms to the Communist Party of the Philippines, its front organisation the National Democratic Front, and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NDF-NPA) onboard the MV Karagatan, which was intercepted in Cagayan.
China has now shunned the export of communism as an ideology. It has embraced what it terms as the “one country, two systems” style of governance, which was the offshoot of the return of two territories held as colonial outposts by the British and the Portuguese in Hong Kong and Macau. It is now the second largest economy in the world and has managed to eradicate poverty in less than fifty years. It is an achievement where other countries had failed and it is admired because of its scale given its population of at least a billion people.
The US continues to be popular and embedded in the Filipino psyche. We identify more as American than Asian. The NatDems are hardly complaining about the pivot to the US of the administration of President Bongbong Marcos. In fact, they have toned down their traditional anti-Marcos rhetoric in support of its policy in the West Philippine Sea and the ongoing demolition of the Duterte family’s political brand.
The “mission” of Atin Ito, a recent “people power” activist stunt at sea, was supposedly successful even if it didn’t reach Scarborough Shoal because it achieved its objectives. In truth and in fact, what we claim as the Kalayaan Island group and Bajo De Masinloc, wasn’t part of the territory ceded by Spain to the US for $20 million in 1898. It was just that the territories had different administrators given the different conflicts which took place in China, as it transitioned from the monarchy of the Emperor, to the republican government of Sun Yat Sen. These conflicts are what enabled Britain and Portugal to establish outposts in Hong Kong and Macau. It is also what motivated Japan to try and conquer China before World War II.
Our sense of nationalism against China is false because the paradigm has shifted. China stopped the export of ideology under Deng Xiao Ping. It focused on nation building and succeeded. China is taking its place on the global stage without utilizing the usual hegemonic tactics of the Western powers. In fact, it pulled a fast one on America which turned China into its manufacturing hub for American companies and expected the Chinese to go to demand more freedoms and overthrow the government as its developed economically. But this didn’t happen. The Chinese government managed the transition well by keeping the people content with the leadership.
It can be said that China is now more progressive than any Western nation. It has also managed to keep its national identity intact which is why it lacks the West’s social unrest. In contrast, the US continues the export of ideology and with it, the wars being fought in the name of democracy throughout the world. What it has managed to do is bring China and Russia on the oath to developing closer ties as evidenced by the visit of Vladimir Putin to China last week.
The Atin Ito coalition was nothing but an episode of the teleserye that is the false sense of nationalism harboured by a number of Filipinos who are convinced that the US is the better alternative to China. We are the only country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that does not identify as Asian. ASEAN has not issued any statement of support for the Philippines in the South China Sea disputes. This is why certain foreign policy experts, such as the Ilokanong-Iranian Richard Heydarian, have been calling out ASEAN member countries.
The reality is, China is the regional leader, not only militarily but also economically. For the other ASEAN member countries, trade is more important than conflict and it is stupid to choose sides between China and the US. This is the practical and logical approach to take but, to Filipinos, making noise against China and embracing Uncle Sam is the right thing to do. Branding Filipinos who think critically and are against the Marcos administration’s foreign policy as traitors or Makapili doesn’t do any good for their cause. The Atin Ito mission symbolizes the Filipino penchant for show or palabas. It is not grounded on facts, ideology or principles but rather political expediency.",Others

The option has always been there but no one has bothered to test it until Duterte. Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) ran for Congress after her Presidency. This was largely ballyhooed by the Opposition but there was nothing illegal about it. The same is true with Duterte showing intent to run as Vice-President. He only needs a political party as a flag of convenience. He can win on his own as he did in 2016. The counter argument to be made is he can be a gadfly to the President who wins but it’s not within his nature to take an uncalculated political risk. He was in the 2016 race to win and he did in his own way on his own terms.
In a conversation with a GRP colleague last night, we analyzed the situation. Marcos wasn’t from the elite when he became a politician — provincial elite at best as his family was known in Batac. But, outside of Batac, Marcos was unknown. He would only rise to prominence when he ran for Congress and later Senator.
The environment in which Marcos won the Presidency in 1965 was different. In the present, the Philippines has 109 million Filipinos with more than half of them at voting age. There is the emergence of the new middle class; overseas Filipino workers (OFW) families who enjoy material wealth because of above-average incomes from working abroad. These are the masa who have moved up in the social rung of society. But their value system is still masa-based and Duterte appeals to them because of his promdi projection.
Duterte understands that continuity is needed to maintain the gains under his administration — “equilibrium” he said in his statement. The fate of the country depends on the power blocs that continue to support Duterte. On the opposite side of the political fence are those who are marginalized because they are out of power. But their main problem is they don’t have much to show for during the 30 years they were in power. Duterte and GMA are both septuagenarians but they still have what it takes to be leaders with gravitas.
There is, however, also room for an alternative to emerge — one who sees the niche in the middle between the two narratives which naturally evolved from the political division which began in 1986. This is why history’s jurors are still out with their judgement on the Marcos period in the country. It took twenty years before there came a President — Marcos — who did what needed to be done right after World War II. The Philippines had always been the leader in democratic initiatives in the region but it has almost always failed to progress because the root cause of the plantation-style political structure has never been addressed. That fundamental social problem persists to this day.
We are not privy to what goes on in the heads of GMA and Duterte but, surely, they have their respective ideas for what comes next. The Opposition, for their part, continue to be stuck in their old narrative. Instead of admitting their mistakes of the past, they continue in their belief that they did right and the public will gravitate back to them. Unfortunately for them, this is no longer the case. Their exploitation of former President Noynoy Aquino’s death ended just as quick as it began. Only their diehard supporters were nostalgic. The general public did not respond to the appeal to emotion because they made that mistake when his mother former President Cory Aquino died in 2009 and Noynoy became President despite his lackluster record as Congressman and Senator.
It is up to the worthy challenger to put forth a disruptive platform which will make an impact on the public. Otherwise, the public will go for what they have seen works.",Others
"UK Immigration, Lies in History and Wokeness Debunked by Simon Webb",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/history-debunked-simon-webb/,,Others
What the Philippines can learn from the late Shinzo Abe,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/what-the-philippines-can-learn-from-the-late-shinzo-abe/,"The assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the campaign period in Nara Prefecture sent shockwaves all over the world. In broad daylight while publicly expressing his support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he was shot from behind using a handmade gun. He was rushed to the nearest prefectural hospital but was declared dead roughly five hours after the incident. Japanese mainstream and social media were filled with news regarding the shooting of a former prime minister, stunning the world with gun-related violence in one of the most peaceful countries on the planet. Needless to say, Japan is a country in mourning. Japanese citizens are paying their deepest respects to Japan’s longest serving head of government after the Meiji Restoration.
As the longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, Shinzo Abe’s long political career yields many lessons to learn from. Hailing from a political dynasty that goes back way before Imperial Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, the late prime minister was colloquially labelled as a “thoroughbred”, referring to his political family pedigree. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi was a former prime minister and his father, Shintaro Abe was the foreign affairs minister of then prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980’s. His brand of leadership is an oxymoron, which can be described with contradictory adjectives. With his visits to a Japanese war memorial in Yasukuni Shrine and for formalizing the Quad and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP), he was both a nationalist and a globalist. For actively opening up Japan to trade, labor, and tourism while being prudent in exercising state powers, he can be called as a liberal and as a conservative. Japanese politics expert Tobias Harris has succinctly found the exact word to describe the late prime minister: an iconoclast.
However, his long term in office was not without its fair share of controversies. The highly publicized “Moritomo Gakuen” scandal, which implicated his wife Akie Abe, suddenly caused the drop in then Prime Minister Abe’s approval ratings. Also, the annual ceremony called “Sakura wo Miru Kai” sponsored by the prime minister’s office was flagged for its financial and budgetary irregularities. Finally, the faulty execution of Japan’s early Covid-19 policy, most specially with the “Abenomask”, generally generated negative reactions in the Japanese public. These unresolved national-level issues paired with his worsening gastrointestinal disease eventually led to his resignation. His untimely demise had unfortunately created more questions than answers in modern-day Japanese politics and society.
As the party leader of LDP, the late prime minister was highly supportive of changing or amending the provisions of the 1947 Japanese constitution. This American-backed pacifist constitution established a unitary parliamentary system of government. The most controversial portion of the current Japanese constitution is Article 9, which states that Japan will renounce war as a sovereign right. This was included in the aforementioned constitution, specially with Imperial Japan’s bellicose actions that led to the Second World War. However, geopolitical dynamics of the Pacific are changing drastically and threats to security of the Japanese islands are present. As the only country devastated by two nuclear attacks, having Russia, North Korea, and China at one’s doorstep will make any country feel uneasy. With these imminent threats imposed by these nuclear-armed nation-states, Shinzo Abe advocated for changing this restrictive constitution to address these national insecurities.
Similar with the late prime minister, Filipinos should welcome and take the necessary steps in changing the provisions of the 1987 constitution. Even though the contexts in amending the 1947 Japanese constitution and the 1987 Philippine constitution are completely different, the constitution sets the tone as to what kind of institutions are to be created. This constitution should be amended in accordance to the needs, challenges, and future threats that a country might face. As what US President Thomas Jefferson also advocated, the highest law of the land should be rewritten roughly every two decades. This highlights that constitutions are not meant to last forever in its original form, but must evolve together with the state and society.
Right after his death was publicly confirmed by the prefectural hospital, messages of condolence from various heads of states and governments poured into Japan. Japanese nationals from all walks of life offered flowers, beverages, and prayers to the late prime minister. His official residence in Tokyo, the LDP office near the Japanese Diet, his headquarters as the Representative of Yamaguchi Prefecture’s 4th District, and even the exact location of his assassination in Nara were filled with offerings from ordinary individuals. This explains how Japan respects public office and their officials beyond politics, which is a remarkable reflection of what mature liberal democracies are ought to become.
In a similar manner, all Filipinos must respect public office, whether one is an elected politician, a bureaucrat, or an ordinary Juan dela Cruz. Burning effigies of public figures, throwing of unnecessary insults and tirades, and instigating civil disorder that is being promoted by these activist groups will not create an atmosphere of political accountability. These provocative actions risk escalation that lean towards violence. Filipinos must be politically mature in decision-making, and let their votes serve as society’s true voice as the basis for political mandate. This “live and let live” attitude is a central tenet for any functioning democracy.
Aside from prayers and messages offered to the late head of government, the current Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida quickly denounced Shinzo Abe’s assassination during the campaign trail. This act of terror is an attack on democracy, as what the current prime minister has mentioned in his public speech. He also called for ordinary citizens to practice their right to suffrage and resist such threats to protect and defend the peoples’ freedoms and democracy itself. Eventually, the sitting prime minister’s political party, the LDP was awarded with resounding victory, together with its junior coalition partner Komeito, even though such electoral victory tasted bittersweet in their perspective.
The Philippines too has its own share of experiences regarding election-related violence, where guns are banned and alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited during elections. These realities paired with a long history about guns, goons, and gold associated with Philippine politics created Filipinos who have lost trust not only in the government, but with democracy. Philippine democracy has always been flawed, but it does not necessarily mean that the country must turn towards autocracy, despite these temptations. Genuine democracy demands greater participation of all sectors of the society resulting to plurality and inclusivity, and Filipinos must entrust themselves in creating a democracy that functions well and will serve the interests of the country. An inclusive democracy begins with people who are capable of defending their freedoms and is paired with a system that preserves such.
Beyond Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s demise, Japan will definitely move forward. The Japanese people learn from the past, but they never let their past alone define who they are as a nation.

A three decade throwback: the 1992 presidential elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/a-three-decade-throwback-the-1992-presidential-elections/,"President Ferdinand Marcos Jr had recently finished his first State of the Nation Address last month. Numerous analysts have lauded the president’s speech for showcasing what technocracy really is, most specially when he has enumerated his legislative agenda that should be prioritized by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Hopefully, Marcos Jr’s six-year term will guide the Philippines beyond these tumultuous times. Nevertheless, it’s a good time to rewind and analyze the presidential elections held exactly thirty years ago, which definitely led to various political, economic, and social repercussions that the country is currently experiencing.
The 1992 Philippine presidential elections was the first general elections held under the 1987 Constitution. Six years after the conclusion of the 1986 EDSA revolution, the Filipino electorate chose one president, one vice president, and 24 senators in national positions. The top twelve senators ended up serving for six years, while the next twelve were only for three years. These elections held the promises of the aforementioned revolution, which turned out to be broken promises due to the Philippines’ systemic and structural flaws, which were further exacerbated by the faulty constitution.
To contextualize the situation of the Philippines during the Corazon Aquino administration years, the whole country was experiencing various socio-political and economic problems. Political stability was nearly absent as the military, most specially from the members of the Reformed Armed Forces Movement (RAM), which mounted a number of coup d’état attempts against the government. Perennial energy shortages also didn’t help as regular blackouts dampened productivity of Philippine companies. In addition, servicing debt was a tedious task because of the great devaluation of the Philippine peso during the 1980’s. Institutionalized graft and corruption in both public and private sectors created more discontented Filipinos as poverty continued to dehumanize families.
Leading to the presidential elections of 1992, then-President Corazon Aquino decided not to vie for the presidency. Instead, seven candidates who held considerable influence in the Philippine political arena ran for the aforementioned position. These seven candidates can be roughly associated to two groups. Out of those seven candidates, five presidentiables can be classified under the Aquino administration, while the remaining two can be labeled under the opposition. The five administration-aligned candidates were Vice President Salvador Laurel, Senate President Jovito Salonga, Speaker Ramon Mitra, Agrarian Reform Secretary Miriam Santiago, and the eventual winner, National Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos. The remaining two opposition-aligned presidentiables were business magnate Danding Cojuangco and former first lady Imelda Marcos.
Paired with their vice presidential candidates, all of these presidentiables had their own respective provincial bailiwicks. Survey frontrunner Miriam Santiago had Western Visayas, while opposition candidates Danding Cojuangco and Imelda Marcos had Central Luzon and Northern Luzon respectively. In addition, Salvador Laurel had Batangas, Ramon Mitra had Palawan, while Fidel Ramos had Pangasinan. However, various surveys were initially pointing that Miriam Santiago is poised to claim victory, since she had popular support from various sectors of the society. The youth aggressively backed her candidacy, together with the Ilonggo diaspora in Mindanao. Businesses who benefitted from her no non-sense approach as immigration commissioner tacitly supported her. Her feisty character and unquestionable competence, paired with her increasing media exposure in uncovering corruption issues and abuses made her a sellable product in the eyes of most Filipinos.
Even though Sec. Santiago was technically a part of the government, the Aquino administration disliked her calls for reform, most specially during her tenure in the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). These conflicts-of-interests on the side of the Aquinos and Cojuangcos led to the said secretary leaving the cabinet. Later on, then-President Corazon Aquino confirmed her support in favor of the candidacy of Department of National Defense (DND) Sec. Fidel Ramos, where political pundits say that Pres. Aquino’s blessing was basically returning the favor towards Sec. Ramos for addressing the numerous coup d’états and military takeover attempts against her government.
Fidel Ramos, boasting a lengthy military and political career, was seen initially lagging in various surveys. A military-man by profession, General Ramos was indispensable in the administrations of presidents Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino. Nevertheless, his leap towards Malacañang was also faced with difficulties when the “Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino” (LDP) nominated then-Speaker of the House Ramon Mitra as the party’s official standard bearer. This led him to bolt from LDP and made his own political party, Lakas-CMD. Together with his massive political machinery, rich military background and Pres. Aquino’s support, he eventually won the presidency with roughly a fourth of the total votes cast, albeit with various election-related irregularities, which would include allegations that Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi provided financial support in millions of pesos towards his campaign.
If all numbers were taken into consideration, all of these candidates had good chances in winning the race towards Malacañang, including Liberal Party candidate Jovito Salonga and Nacionalista Party candidate Salvador Laurel, as long they were able to consolidate these various groups that they were initially aligned with. However, the complete polarization and disintegration of these groups demonstrate how Philippine politics never allowed the creation of grounds to unite nor set their differences aside. In turn, this created a series of presidencies where candidates only needed to win the most number of votes through plurality, instead of garnering a majority of votes. This trend was broken by President Marcos Jr’s electoral victory last May.
Aside from the reality that the assembled coalition to confront then-President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 crumbled in 1992, it can be observed that political parties in the Philippines are mere vehicles for politicians in winning elections. Philippine political parties are no longer about ideologies nor platforms, but instead institutionalized the careers of politicians who surfed the ebbs and flows of public sentiment. The 1992 elections showed to us that the two main political parties in the Philippines through the Nacionalista Party and Liberal Party have greatly weakened, but still hold a degree of influence in Philippine politics. Santiago’s People’s Reform Party (PRP) and Mitra’s LDP still occupy seats in the Congress, but Ramos’ Lakas-CMD and Cojuangco’s Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) have continued to exert significant influence. This can be observed with the current Vice President Sara Duterte’s alignment towards Lakas-CMD and NPC occupying five Senate seats. Albeit having no representatives in both the Congress and Senate, Marcos’ Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) has her son as the country’s current chief executive.
Unfortunately, the 1992 presidential elections was a testament to the failure of creating inclusive political institutions by the 1987 constitution. Ideally, competent statesmen and stateswomen like Miriam Santiago and Salvador Laurel should have been presidents in this country. These kinds of individuals definitely know how to run a government. Sadly, their names would be lumped together with the likes of Carlos P. Romulo and Claro M. Recto in Philippine history as the best presidents that the Philippines never had.",Others
A year after the Ukrainian crisis: what’s for the Philippines?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/a-year-after-the-ukrainian-crisis-whats-for-the-philippines/,"More than a year has passed since hostilities began when Moscow executed its special military operations on Ukrainian territory. Initially, numerous military analysts predicted a swift victory for Russia in a similar way when the port city of Sevastopol and the Crimean peninsula changed hands through false flag operations. However, the Ukrainians strongly defied these aggressions as they slowly pushed back the Russian military behemoth. Damage to properties and loss of lives are mounting on both sides while international media agencies have continuously featured human suffering in Eastern Europe. Despite tenacious fighting in Eastern Ukraine, there are no conclusive victories so far as a military stalemate is being reported from the battlefield.
Even though aggressions in Ukraine are currently confined in the annexed portions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, its economic shockwaves can be felt outside the Eurasian continent. Prices of basic food commodities like wheat and edible oil skyrocketed as both Ukraine and Russia are renowned exporters of these goods. Prices of hydrocarbons also soared in the global market as European countries started stockpiling energy reserves in the forms of oil and gas. In addition, as stockpiles of military hardware are being used daily in the launching of missiles and rockets in the frontlines, the demand to replenish them increased too. This leads to more procurements that favor arms-producing companies. These companies that form the military-industrial complex seem to be the only winners in this Ukrainian crisis.
Political consequences also shook the whole planet. The United States is supplying the Ukrainians with highly advanced weaponry systems that include javelins, stingers, multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), and the Abrams tank. Other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member-countries like Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom have also contributed European-designed military hardware like the Leopard and Challenger tanks. Russia’s neighbors in Finland and Sweden, which have adopted a more neutral stance in its history vis-à-vis Moscow’s security concerns, eventually applied for NATO membership. To make matters worse for Moscow, G7 countries are both denouncing and constraining Russia, where Russian institutions are isolated in the sectors of trade, technology, and finance. With a quick military victory out of its equation, the Kremlin was compelled to aggressively employ mercenaries in the form of the Wagner Group, while mobilizing and conscripting portions of the Russian population. It is safe to say that both Moscow and Kiev are locked in a battle of attrition.
Before contextualizing these developments, there is a need to understand the reasons that led Russia to occupy Ukrainian territories, which is an interplay of various factors. Prior to its dissolution, Ukraine was an integral part of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) as it was considered the Soviet breadbasket and a key host of nuclear weapons during the Cold War. With its relatively flat terrain, Ukrainians had witnessed the armies of Nazi Germany pushing their way into major Russian cities like Stalingrad and Leningrad in the Second World War. This has generated a historical paranoia in the Kremlin, where buffer states would serve as security guarantees for Moscow. With NATO member-states in this military alliance multiplying in number after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian insecurities intensified and eventually led Russian President Vladimir Putin to modernize and invest in its military capabilities. With the Kremlin relatively confident in its initial actions towards Ukraine, it annexed some of these territories from Kiev, albeit at a high cost.
Institutions created through multilateral agreements in the forms of NATO and the European Union (EU), backed by the United States and its allies, confronted Moscow by imposing sanctions, freezing financial assets, and limiting trade with Russia. This is a bitter pill to swallow, most specially in Germany — a country known for its energy dependence — which continually purchased Russian oil and gas under competitive prices. With Moscow being isolated from the global market, it can no longer easily obtain imported commodities from other countries unless they utilize a third-party player to facilitate these transactions. Russian banking institutions were also not spared, as they were severed from the SWIFT system, which integrates and simplifies international money transfers.
These economic sanctions slapped against Russia initially decreased the value of its currency, the Russian ruble. With such devaluation, Russia experienced inflation rates that seemed unmanageable at first as global companies withdrew from the Russian market. This drop in confidence was exacerbated by the looming possibility of higher unemployment rates as job opportunities evaporated. In addition, Russia’s economy isn’t as complex as other more sophisticated economies such as those of Japan, Switzerland, or South Korea, which didn’t bode well for Russian economic outlook. However, massive interventions instigated to address capital flight and timely adjustments in its monetary policy have cushioned its adverse effects. By pegging the ruble to gold and by propping up demand for the Russian currency through hydrocarbon trade, the local market gradually stabilized. Both New Delhi and Beijing became stopgaps for the bleeding Russian economy as India and China stepped up the volume of hydrocarbon purchases from Moscow in pursuance of their own economic realpolitik.
In an attempt to further isolate Russia, the International Criminal Court (ICC) had recently formally issued arrest warrants for the Russian President on account of alleged war crimes similar to the late Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. However, the chances of Vladimir Putin being arrested is effectively close to zero as the ICC has no jurisdiction over Russian territory. In addition, the current world order that is anarchic in nature dictates that international law is not as strong as what is purported on paper. Russia’s current standing as a great power among nations makes these arrest warrants no more than pipedreams — mere PR devices to make President Vladimir Putin accountable.
The Ukrainian crisis leaves the Asian peoples to address the biggest elephant in their room — the conflict between Beijing and Taipei. This geopolitical issue has never been resolved since Imperial Japan left Taiwan in 1945. With Chinese and Taiwanese territorial waters lying geographically close to the Philippines, such escalations erupting in the Taiwan strait can be considered as a possible national security threat for Manila. Various possibilities are being entertained by Japan as their southernmost prefecture in Okinawa is host to American military bases. Does the Philippines even have feasible contingency plans when push comes to shove between Beijing and Taipei? In the event of military action from China, local government units in Okinawa display no confidence in housing thousands of refugees fleeing Taiwan. How much more about the capabilities of Batanes islands?
Unfortunately, many Filipinos still think that the United States will unilaterally resolve these geopolitical issues. Despite being deliberately written in the constitution that the Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy, mendicant diplomacy still seems to be pervasive in the Filipino mindset. The dilapidated World War II era BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal is testament to continued Filipino dependence on their forrmer colonial master’s security umbrella. Just looking at how the administration of former President Noynoy Aquino clumsily fumbled in its management of the Scarborough Shoal issue by portraying American assurances in a high pedestal while blaming Chinese actions instead of adopting de-escalation tactics summarizes how disassociated from reality many Filipinos are when it comes to geopolitics. Indeed, ignorance is bliss.",Others
Is the Ninoy Aquino assassination of 1983 still a significant part of our history?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/08/is-the-ninoy-aquino-assassination-of-1983-still-a-significant-part-of-our-history/,"I was one of those who joined every major protest action against the Marcos dictatorship at that time. My view, in large part, was shaped by my professors who were mostly anti-Marcos. They controlled the narrative then and I had not developed my critical thinking skillset at that point. I couldn’t see the inconsistencies in the narrative and so I fell for it hook, line and sinker.
This narrative — of a glorious “people’s revolution” that the grassroots spontaneously mounted on EDSA leading to the ascent to power of the late Cory Aquino — is one that is still lapped up by prominent thought leaders as Inquirer columnist Randy David demonstrates gushing about its core tenet in his recent piece “The significance of Ninoy Aquino’s assassination” where he writes…
As pioneers in the art of deploying people power to oust a dictator, we Filipinos like to remember the four-day phenomenon that overthrew the Marcos regime as virtually bloodless and nonviolent. But if we shift our gaze to the long years of resistance preceding the collapse of the dictatorship, it would be hard to miss the countless lives that were brutally destroyed by the regime.
Such is the grossly-misappropriated credit in Filipinos’ imagined faculties for self-determination that persisted for decades since 1986. After a year of the Cory administration, I became disillusioned because I saw the return of the political structure which left the country in gridlock. By that time, I knew that Cory was not going to live up to the promises she made, what with anomalies left and right in her government, exposed by no less than Max Soliven and Louie Beltran, two of her husband’s staunchest supporters.
Contrary to what David and his fellow Yellow Narrative cheerleaders assert, EDSA was nothing more than a power grab because then President Ferdinand E. Marcos made the mistake of not issuing a succession plan. It was made worse by the rift between the power blocs in his administration. former First Lady Imelda Marcos, “crony” Danding Cojuangco, and then Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile, all saw themselves as succeeding Marcos but the patron did not designate a successor. Marcos wouldn’t have been toppled if he didn’t give in to the Americans and called a snap election. The hubris that came with thinking that he was still in control ultimately led to his downfall.
Sadly, we are still worse off than when we started again after 1986. Our problems are worse and there is not much hope in sight. The only hope was the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte but that was cut short by the pandemic. We now have another Marcos in power, the son Ferdinand Jr.
We were warned about Junior by both his father and Duterte but there was not much of a choice in 2022. Duterte’s succession plan involved his daughter Sara and his trusted aide Bong Go running for the two highest posts but the former would not acquiesce to his wish. History has come full circle. The Aquinos have been discredited and consigned to oblivion. Marcos Jr. is following in the same path.
There are no upcoming leaders in sight who have the gravitas for the presidency. We have clowns in Congress and the Senate. Duterte warned of this eventuality when in one of his SONAs he stated that the system was rotten from the core. The future is bleak.",Others
Songs of praises to the glory of Noynoy Aquino will fail to move a politically-mature Filipino public,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/songs-of-praises-to-the-glory-of-noynoy-aquino-will-fail-to-move-a-politically-mature-filipino-public/,"Manila Standard columnist Banayo conspicuously leaves out former President Ferdinand “Apo Lakay” Marcos in the mention of Philippine Presidents in his piece “A stone for the edifice” where he shares his own version of Pantheon. The piece is obviously in praise of the recently departed former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino.
It is easy for us to criticize presidents from the armchairs and the laptops we write upon.
A free press and the freedom of expression, after all, are the hallmarks of democracy, without which, authoritarianism prevails. The checks and balances enhanced by public criticism are essential to fostering good governance from our rulers by pointing out shortcomings and when substantiated, failures in moral and legal standards.
But we should give credit where credit is due. To snipe at perceived failures of a former president simply because these are borne by biases and prejudice are not only in poor taste, but poor judgment.
Let history judge, and let generations after, measure the stone, or stones, each president leaves in the edifice of nation-building.
Banayo seems to have forgotten the maxim that with great power comes even greater responsibility and expectation. Elpidio Quirino was felled by his golden pisspot. Ramon Magsaysay died under mysterious circumstances in a plane crash. Diosdado Macapagal was a one-term President brought down by the Stonehill scandal. Fidel Ramos was off to a good start but it’s he who’s largely responsible for our water and power woes up to this time.
The truth is there wasn’t much reconstruction and rehabilitation from the destruction wrought by World War II until Marcos became President. Since his ouster, it is only now that the focus on infrastructure has been realized. Perhaps the better question is, why can’t we heap praises on Presidents while they are still living? Why do we have to wait for them to pass on? Perhaps it’s the heat of the moment? Most of the public tend to believe media reports without being able to read between the lines. Then there is partisan bias fuelled by class issues. I’ve said before that two of our biggest problems are the entitled rich and the entitled poor. It’s the middle class who bears the most burden but they are also the most silent as they go about their daily lives.
Tomorrow will mark the seven-day anniversary of Aquino’s passing but the edification will not end. The bashing that Aquino got which began during the middle of his term has Duterte enduring the same from the beginning of his. It is not likely to end after he steps down. Duterte doesn’t bitch and whine. He doesn’t make demands on the owner of a broadcast network or a broadsheet for some anchor or columnist to be removed. He has been called all sorts of names but he doesn’t react. Compare this with the President who was furious over the term “noynoying” which came to be used to describe the overall character of his administration. This was coined by the print media then due to the then President’s seemingly long absences from the public eye. Aquino never held Cabinet meetings. He also never bothered to visit troops in their camps. He didn’t bother to show up for the arrival honors of the men massacred at Mamasapano, who followed the orders he had given as commander in-chief.
The best barometer of a President’s performance is the public’s judgment. Post-Marcos presidents have had no success anointing their chosen ones. Ramos’ victory was tainted by electoral fraud. It was thinner than President Rodrigo Duterte’s 39% plurality. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s (GMA’s) candidate Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro lost in 2010. So did Aquino’s Mar Roxas in 2016. Should Duterte’s anointed win, would that finally silence his detractors? Not really. Our politicians have not yet reached that level of maturity. The same is true with the public. In this case, it is the classic chicken-or-egg conundrum; which comes first? The maturity of the politicians or that of the public?
We are facing huge challenges brought about by the pandemic. They will not end soon. In the coming election, we should focus more on issues, not personalities. We shouldn’t fall for motherhood statements anymore. What we need to hear and read about are concrete plans if action moving forward. We shouldn’t fall for edification traps which tug at our emotional heartstrings which has often ended in us, the public, holding the short end of the stick while politicians laugh all the way to the bank with our monies.",Others
What the US pullout from Afghanistan could mean for the future of Philippine-US relations,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/what-the-us-pullout-from-afghanistan-could-mean-for-the-future-of-philippine-us-relations/,"I was a college student at the University of the Philippines when the United States was struck by a series of acts of terrorism on September 11, 2001. As my college friends and I were having dinner, live footage of the burning twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City after each of them were struck by an airliner was being shown on television, with people running away from the area and the buildings eventually collapsing. Later news reports came in, saying that the Pentagon, the massive Arlington, Virginia headquarters of the US Department of Defense and the US Armed Forces, was also struck by an airliner, causing a section of it to catch fire. Another airliner crashed in a sparsely-populated region of the US state of Pennsylvania after taking off from Washington, DC.
With thousands of people killed, it was later revealed that what happened back then were acts of terrorism because of the seemingly coordinated and choreographed way that the airliners were utilized as bombs. American authorities revealed that Saudi nationals linked to Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire who was the leader of Al Qaeda, a global terrorist organization hijacked the airliners and flew them to specific targets in New York and Arlington, Virginia while the airplane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania was supposed to strike another major Washington, DC area target. Bin Laden was immediately named as the mastermind of the terrorist attacks on US soil, with the Americans accusing the Taliban, a religious fundamentalist group that controlled much of Afghanistan and imposed overly strict interpretation of the Muslim Sharia Law over Afghans, especially women, of harboring him.
The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were used as justification by the United States Government in planning and executing the invasion of Afghanistan, with the help of its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Americans and their allies, backed by their powerful and high-tech weapons and equipment, and well-trained and well-equipped armed forces, got into Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban from power, with them first supporting a provisional government before backing a new leader in Hamid Karzai. While Afghanistan continued to be occupied and the country was being prepared for the route towards having a Western-style “democracy” and military, the hunt for Osama Bin Laden continued, with the Americans eventually finding and killing him not in Afghanistan but in a mountainous region of neighboring Pakistan.
After 20 years, countless American and non-American military and non-military, and Afghan civilian and combatant lives lost, and US$2 trillion spent on both the war and supporting the Afghan government and military, the United States and its allies decided to slowly but surely pull out of Afghanistan, leaving the administration and destiny of the country completely at the hands of the Afghans. America’s NATO allies were the first ones to gradually withdraw from Afghanistan. The United States, being the country with the most number of troops and assets on the ground, planned to do a phased withdrawal, with the Americans believing that the Afghans were ready for the future on their own since their government and military were well-prepared after years of preparation and support, and trillions of US dollars invested to make it possible.
However, the United States and its NATO allies did not completely crush the Taliban. With its wounds healed after the beating that it got from its Afghan rivals and their foreigner allies, the Taliban consolidated its forces and slowly regained lost territory while also secretly conducting meetings with the Americans and other foreign occupying forces. Taliban representatives even reached out to the side of then Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to explore the possibility of forming a coalition government, which Ghani firmly rejected. As the Americans and their NATO allies finally made it clear that they would pull out from Afghanistan, the Taliban took its chance and started its sweep across the country.
In a matter of weeks, the Taliban took control of almost the entirety of Afghanistan, taking key cities and provinces with little or no resistance from members of the Western-backed and -equipped Afghan military and police. Within several days, the Taliban reached the outskirts of the capital, Kabul, causing Ghani to flee to Tajikistan and other Afghan officials fled to other countries and to still non-Taliban-controlled portions of the country. The quick turn of the events forced the United States and its NATO allies to suddenly change course, bringing back their own troops, this time to evacuate their embassies and their nationals out of Afghanistan as quickly as possible in scenes that were a reminder of American military helicopters evacuating Americans and South Vietnamese nationals from the rooftop of the United States Embassy in Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City).
Taliban forces finally entered Kabul and occupied the presidential palace. For them, they began reaching it to the rest of the world, projecting a seemingly “reformed moderate” image while promising the protect the rights of Afghans, especially women, while “operating within Sharia law.” This did not calm down ordinary Afghans, many of whom went to the Kabul Airport in hopes of catching a flight out of the country or tried to cross border crossings towards Pakistan and other neighboring countries to flee for their lives. Images of people desperately trying to cling onto and eventually falling to their deaths from American C-17 military transport aircraft carrying US nationals were shown on televisions, computers and mobile phones worldwide, painting what seems to be a total breakdown of order in Afghanistan after 20 years of occupation by the United States and its NATO allies and a doom-and-gloom scenario of uncertainty for the country and the region as the Taliban returns to power.
I do agree with the idea of the United States and its NATO allies pulling out of Afghanistan after being there for 20 years. To start with, they should not be in that country or have entered that country at all despite what happened on September 11, 2001. Second, the people of Afghanistan should be able to determine the fate of their country and society without the intervention of outsiders. Third, the lives of many American and NATO soldiers were sacrificed unnecessarily for a war that their countries should not have launched or got involved into at all, especially with the United states and its NATO allies entering a country without having a full understanding of its geography, culture and realities on the ground, which is perhaps the reason why the Taliban is still standing and has returned to power after 20 years.
However, the United States and its NATO allies, with their decision to move into Afghanistan, gave their commitment to the Afghan people and the Afghan government to help rebuild their country, military and society. Maybe the Afghans themselves can be faulted for depending on Westerners too much, especially for rebuilding their military and infrastructure. However, the Afghans would not have done so if there seemed to be no commitment to them coming from the Westerners, even if US President Joe Biden, in his most recent speech, said that the United States “never intended to do nation-building work” in Afghanistan.
Some may think that the consequences of the pullout of the United States and its NATO allies from Afghanistan, especially the country being taken over once again by the Taliban, are limited to Afghanistan and its adjacent countries. That is not really the case, as the move by the Americans would put into question their commitment to the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and other allied countries.
For instance, American officials, invoking, among many things, the 1951 Philippine-US Mutual Defense Treaty, have repeatedly expressed their commitment to “help defend” the Philippines against China in case conflict in the South China Sea arises without actually giving any specifics unlike the commitment that they gave to the Japanese, South Koreans and Taiwanese. The pro-American Filipinos tend to perceive this something that the Americans are going to honor. The current Afghanistan situation put that United States commitment to the Philippines in question since the Americans themselves pulled out from Afghanistan and Biden himself said that they “never intended to do nation-building” in that country in sharp contrast to the expectations set by their Afghan counterparts. It is now a fatal mistake for the Philippines and Filipinos to even have the perception that the Americans are going to become their “knight in shining armor” once a military conflict arises given the conduct of the United States in Afghanistan.
What is happening in Afghanistan now should be a reality check to the Philippines and Filipinos in the sense that the Philippines and Filipinos have no one else but themselves to depend on when it comes to defending the country and its interests. This is exactly the reason why President Rodrigo Duterte is pursuing an independent foreign policy by being friends with everybody, from fellow Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to the United States to the European nations to other Asian powers such as Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and India to Israel and the Middle Eastern countries to non-traditional allies such as China and Russia. Some may call it “fence-sitting” or, as what members of the political opposition, the Jose Maria Sison-led Far Left individuals and groups, and “wokes” brand it, “being a sellout to China” but an independent foreign policy is a pragmatic approach by Duterte and the Philippines to get what it wants politically, economically and militarily without getting deeply involved with only one side of the geopolitical pole or even engaging in a political or, worse, military conflict with another country. Duterte seems to have seen in advance what is happening to Afghanistan right now, hence his decision to pursue a pragmatic approach towards Philippine foreign policy upon assuming office.
The Philippines can avoid becoming an Afghanistan because there are measures in place to prevent it from happening. One is the Anti-Terrorism Law, which is a remedy against the rise of possible activities that may perpetrated by extremists and religious fundamentalists, as what almost happened during the Marawi Crisis from several years ago. The other is the current independent foreign policy which protects the Philippines and Filipinos from the serious consequences of failed alliances or the non-fulfillment of commitments made by the United States or any country. The fourth is having a pragmatic leader in Rodrigo Duterte, who was able to come up with the right political moves, especially in the conduct of the nation’s foreign policy, because he is not beholden to any local or foreign power or any ideology.",Others
Legal fees incurred by Aquino gov’t in The Hague to “win” Ph-China arbitration case BLEW national budget,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/legal-fees-incurred-by-aquino-govt-in-the-hague-to-win-ph-china-arbitration-case-blew-national-budget/,"A source has provided us with the copies of what appear to be two collection letters sent by the US law firm of Foaley Hoag, counsel to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in the arbitral case it filed before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.
The letters clearly define the issue of Itu Aba as delineated by former Solicitor-General Florin Hilbay, in his rejoinder to former Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio on the matter of the case filed before the PCA against China, after the loss of Scarborough Shoal to the Chinese.
The letters are addressed to Solicitor-General Jose Calida, then Acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo and Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel Romualdez.
It would appear that the administration of then President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III failed to provide for payment of attorneys’ fees in the national budget for the services rendered by Foaley Hoag. It seems to have come to a point where they resorted to a threat to file suit in Manila to collect on the amount owed them. The amount in question is $803,000.00. This is over and above what had been initially paid upon their acceptance of the case and other fees and expenses related to the same. There has been no public accounting of the cost of the case except for published estimates that it was well over one billion pesos.
Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the arbitral “win” of the Philippines over China and the opposition and even the US Embassy in Manila, as well as the US State Department issued statements hailing it as historical and serving the cause of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. We leave it up to you, our readers, to decide if we actually “won.” There is also the matter of who really benefited from the case as it has been revealed by both Hilbay, and former Senator Antonio Trillanes, in the piece we ran yesterday, that then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario, was calling the shots and not then President Aquino himself. Trillanes was taking his instructions from President Aquino but Del Rosario was also negotiating with then Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell, who was in direct communication with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying.
As we have noted, the arbitral case has not had the desired result of the Philippines gaining back control of Scarborough Shoal. In fact, the arbitral panel ruled that it should be for the joint-exploitation of China and the Philippines without mention of sovereignty.

US unilateral pullout from Afghanistan a warning to its “allies”: Americans are NOT the good guys,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/us-unilateral-pullout-from-afghanistan-a-warning-to-its-allies-americans-are-not-the-good-guys/,"In his Inquirer piece today “Afghanistan: Biden’s ‘Fall of Saigon’ moment”, columnist Richard Javad Heydarian quotes former US ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker who “points out” that “the rot ‘began under President Trump when he authorized negotiations between the US and the Taliban without the Afghan government in the room,’ which was ‘a huge demoralizing factor for the Afghan government and its security forces’.” He then writes how “the Taliban could have been kept at bay and eventually compelled into a genuine power-sharing agreement with the democratically elected leaders. But Biden was determined to quickly disentangle his country from the Middle East in order to focus on the real threat, which is China.”
Javad conveniently omits that Biden could’ve waited until the peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government produced concrete results in Doha. What Biden did was unilaterally pullout US troops without an exit strategy. Biden can blame Trump all he wants but Trump didn’t order a pullout. It was Biden who did which is why all this is on him.
Afghanistan is a warning to all “American allies.” The US defers to no interests other than its own. This was the case in Vietnam. In the Philippines the ugly truth was, after World War II, the US didn’t give a rat’s ass about its only colony. Its focus was on Japan. The Philippines was given “independence” but in name only because the Constitution was amended so Americans would still have parity rights. There was no Marshall Plan for the rebuilding of the country. Even reparations from Japan were set by the US in the Treaty of San Francisco signed in 1957. It wasn’t until Ferdinand Marcos was elected in 1965 that the Philippines began to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during the war. We were treated like vassals. The Americans kept their bases which was what was important to them. It kept their presence in the region that was likely to be overrun by left-leaning leaders like Sukarno, whom they also ousted in a coup.
The US actually supported Marcos’s declaration of martial law but they eventually turned against him because of the non-renewal of parity rights and the shortened military bases agreement for which Marcos demanded compensation for their use. The Opposition is predominantly pro-US because they would like the Americans to kick out President Rodrigo Duterte. Former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada who was ousted in a “people power” coup in 2001 was also a victim of US hegemony. The Americans wanted Erap out because he favored all-out war against the Muslim secessionists. The US favored autonomy bordering on independence because they wanted new bases near the Strait of Malacca which is a vital shipping lane. They laid the groundwork with infrastructure investments in Mindanao through USAID. The General Santos Airport and Makar Wharf were to be the new Clark and Subic. If not for the timely Supreme Court ruling declaring the claim of ancestral domain as the basis for autonomy then the US would’ve had its way in Muslim Mindanao.
Duterte has been playing a delicate balancing act between the US and China. A shooting war between the two powers would have the Philippines caught right smack in the middle in the same way it found itself in World War II. The Opposition will sell us out if ever they seize power again. We will lose the gains we have made with the independent foreign policy Duterte has adopted. But make no mistake about it. The minute China makes an attempt to take back Taiwan, there will be conflict between the US and China. Without proximity to Taiwan we cannot avoid the fallout specially with the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in force.
The fall of Afghanistan means the Taliban and other Islamic fundamentalist terrorists will have a safe haven of operations again which means a higher threat level for Muslim separatists in Mindanao. We shouldn’t forget the lessons of Marawi which is why the leaders of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BAR) should be more assiduous in the development of former conflict areas under their control. The fall of Afghanistan has made Muslim autonomy an election issue particularly with funding and the ongoing implementation of the peace agreement and the Bangsamoro Organic Law.",Others
Debunking the Yellowtard fantasy that “God takes an Aquino whenever the Philippines is in trouble”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/debunking-the-yellowtard-fantasy-that-god-takes-an-aquino-whenever-the-philippines-is-in-trouble/,"The eminent political sociologist Randy David weighs in on former President Noynoy Aquino’s death and, predictably, he also employs gaslighting. In his Inquirer piece “The outside of politics”, David all but plants a halo upon the head of Aquino. Incorruptible, honest and decent are the adjectives used. It’s as if the average Filipino didn’t suffer during the Aquino administration.
The economy was doing fine but what of its effect on the populace in terms of expanding metropolitan areas carrying the burden of an influx of migrants from the poorer regions in their search for employment? What of the politics of vengeance when it was floated that a truth commission be established to look into the corruption during the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA)? Then there are the costs associated to the canceled awarded infrastructure projects. Northrail and the Laguna Lake Dike and Circumferential Road were two of the biggest. The cost to the Filipino people was north of P1 billion for each.
David is careful not to sound like he is exploiting the death of Noynoy. But he is. The mantra is God sacrifices an Aquino whenever the country is in danger. He writes that he hopes it would “fuel a powerful drive for the return of decency, dignity, and diligence in government.” It’s as if they have a direct line to the good lord. Maybe this is why the Church is always on their side. But the other elephant in the room maxim with religious basis, also applies to them; why do bad things happen to good people?
Juan Ponce Enrile and Imelda Marcos have outlived all the Aquinos. Is it safe to say they’ve cut a deal with the devil and sold their souls in exchange for longevity? It is not really up to us to judge who should die or live. It is extremely bothersome that those who are supposed to be good Catholics are actually the one who wish their political enemies dead. The term for this dysfunction is religious narcissism. Those who are without sin should cast the first stone and thou shalt not worship other gods, listen to false prophets and engage in idolatry are the tenets violated. The messaging is uniform. An Aquino has been sacrificed at the altar of Philippine politics.
It is time for the Filipino to wake up from his stupor of worship for the poon that is President Rodrigo Duterte and go back to the fold of decency and righteousness. This is the parable of the prodigal son. In the Netflix series Lucifer, the banished angel starts out as evil but turns out to be a real angel deep inside such that he is considering replacing his father who wants to retire. Duterte was obviously ailing since 2018 but since last year, he’s made a recovery. The Yellowidiots constantly speculate about his health and any prolonged absence in public has them speculating if he’s dead. They publicly wish him dead. But here he is still alive.
Duterte does not mince words in speaking to and of his political enemies. He is not anything like an Aquino or a Mar Roxas. To the Yellowidiots, he is Lucifer personified. But why is it he’s still alive? If there is a god, why hasn’t he taken evil out by making him dead? Duterte’s record is there for all to see. But the main difference is he doesn’t make false claims about his achievements. Corruption is still present. Drugs has been minimized. Infrastructure projects have been completed. People feel safer in the streets.
I’m no Duterte apologist but I’m sure as hell not going to be gaslighted by Yellowidiots. We all lived through six years of the Aquino administration. We couldn’t wait for it to end but wasn’t excited at the prospect of a Roxas or Jejomar Binay Presidency. What the Yellowidiots are too proud to admit is maybe god had a hand in making Duterte President. To his credit, David engaged a bit of reflection close to that effect…
Listening to the outpouring of grief, lamentation, and praise for this quiet and self-effacing president on his death, one cannot help but ask if the electorate in 2016 saw things differently, so much that they threw all caution to the wind and picked someone who was his antithesis to succeed him. What was it they were looking for at that time which they thought had been lacking in Noynoy Aquino?
In their book, however, any suggestion that God had a hand in Duterte’s ascent to power is blasphemy because God wouldn’t do that to them. Up to the very end, the Yellowidiots remain self-righteous and very, very much entitled. In case they forgot, Duterte’s formative years were also spent with the Jesuits at the Ateneo de Davao. But it goes without saying that he had long been excommunicated because he didn’t fit the mold. Then again, neither did Noynoy because he had always been an average student at best.
It’s a fact of life that if you’re not part of the Establishment you don’t get anywhere in this country. Duterte broke that mold. We have had two Aquino presidents in our history and both turned in sub-par performances as leaders of the country. We know better than to fall for this canard being peddled again. We should be emphatic on May 2022 when we put the final nail on their symbolic coffin.",Others
Lack of a strong national identity makes for dog-eat-dog Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/lack-of-a-strong-national-identity-makes-for-dog-eat-dog-philippine-politics/,"For a political and social scientist, Professor Antonio Contreras surely is naive. But he can also be pragmatic when it comes to his own self-promotion. Borderline personality disorder? Maybe. In his Manila Times piece he rails against the “dirty politics” of these times…
Popular culture has reinforced the image of politics as devoid of virtue. From “Scandal” to “House of Cards” to “Game of Thrones,” what we see are representations of politics as a world full of ambitious and greedy men and women deploying the art of power to serve their interests as they indulge in revenge, backstabbing and betrayal. Alliances are no longer emanating from trust but from convenient realignments ruled by the principle that the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
But if there is one corrosive element that is now pervasive in politics, it is that of betrayal, where former allies become new enemies simply because of ambition. This is precisely dangerous because it violates the very foundation of a body politic, which is built on trust. Social contract subsists on trust. Political representation is founded on the idea of trust. This is why betrayal of public trust rises to the same level as a high crime that warrants impeachment.
History is replete with the stories of how empires came about. The Roman Catholic Church evolved out of the Holy Roman Empire. Religion was the excuse for hegemony. There was royalty and there was the masses. America was supposed to be the land of the free. But look at how divided it is now. These divisions have been there since the British came. Up to now, there has been no justice for the American Indians but black lives matter, Asian lives matter, Hispanic lives matter and so on and so forth.
Contreras has no love lost for populists and conservatives but embraces the leftist-liberal-militant progressives. They too have their own power base. It’s not like they’re pure as driven snow. Has Contreras been face-to-face with a veteran politician like say, Danding Cojuangco? I doubt it. The Professor is limited to academic and therefore theoretical constructs.
My theory is politicos without provenance like former President Ferdinand Marcos suffer from the psychological dysfunction of proving something to themselves or for themselves. Marcos was a brilliant student but he wasn’t beyond the pragmatism of politics. Look at how he risked it all by shooting Julio Nalundasan. What did he and Danding have in common? It might have been the fact that Danding saw how his branch of the family was marginalized by Doña Ysidra. That drove him to succeed and go past what his forebears achieved. It’s interesting to note that Danding never retired. Of the Cojuangco family’s branches, it’s only Danding and his cousin Ramon’s branches which still have both money and power. The Cory branch has lost both. Theirs was the favorite of Doña Ysidra.
If you think about it carefully, President Rodrigo Duterte’s generation is the last vestige of the established power blocs which ruled the country beginning in the 50s through the 70s. Most of the progenies of the powerful politicos then weren’t able to make the transition. Marcos is most successful because his two children have made it as far as the Senate. Juan Ponce Enrile ends with JPE. Ramon Mitra’s children have only made it as far as Congress. Doy Laurel has none. Ninoy Aquino produced his wife Cory and Noynoy. But Noynoy doesn’t have the gravitas to continue having a say. The same is true with Gerry Roxas. The greed for power and money is what has kept the Philippines from becoming as progressive as its Asian neighbors.
The average Pinoy doesn’t identify as Asian. Most political scientists like Contreras suffer from the same malaise. The culprit has always been the lack of a national identity. It is not about political ideology as the Professor claims when he puts it all on the shoulders of Niccolo Machiavelli, writing;
If there is any irony, Machiavelli may have provided us a weapon. We the masses just have to keep fighting the corrupt political “nobility,” even as we yearn for a leader who will check their power and fight for us.
Contreras will never admit it but it was Duterte who broke the political template. He has gone beyond party politics. He doesn’t draw most of his support from oligarchs but from the people. Maybe this is why the National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose stated that Duterte could be recognized by history as one of the greatest, if not the greatest President ever, in the history of the country. This is why I believe that the 2022 election will not only be transformational but also cathartical.",Others
"To the very end, Noynoy Aquino was a man-child and boy-king rolled into one",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/to-the-very-end-noynoy-aquino-was-a-man-child-and-boy-king-rolled-into-one/,"I keep reading Yellowidiot tweets lamenting how the late Noynoy Aquino “died of a broken heart”. Thing is, for most mature and responsible adults, life is about the choices one makes. No justification for pity parties please. Noynoy made his bed and he laid on it. He had his psychological dysfunction which was evident because he was the only son and couldn’t measure up to his father.
Noynoy’s father Ninoy wasn’t what he was projected to be. He may have had an epiphany in detention but the fact that he plotted his own death so Cory can become President was insidious. He still wanted to get even with then President Ferdinand Marcos for the perception the latter robbed of him of what he thought was his destiny, the Philippine Presidency. Both Marcos and Ninoy had gravitas but the former had better intellectual abilities and was an outsider much the way President Rodrigo Duterte was in 2016 and is even to this day.
There are men who stand out among other men. Men who don’t think they control their destiny but it is really destiny that chooses them instead. In Noynoy’s case, he was given the opportunity to be a great leader but he still chose to serve a minority rather than the greater majority of the Filipino people. If it was even half true that the Opposition are the “silent majority,” as they claim to be, why haven’t they been able to win elections post-Aquino?
As President, Noynoy (known at the time as “PNoy”) couldn’t set aside getting even with his and his family’s political enemies. He was driven by hatred. He wasn’t man enough nor had the gravitas to look at the forest instead of the trees. The opposition at the time was more than willing to work with him. There was no impeachment and no destabilization plot during his administration.
By the midpoint of his administration the public was frustrated but he implemented measures to assure his chosen candidates victory in the midterm election. He jailed his political opponents thinking that he could ensure a Mar Roxas victory in 2016. But Duterte came in from left field after making a big mark on the radar of the national political scene. Lila Ramos Shahani relates how she asked his uncle, former President Fidel Ramos, to endorse PNoy in 2010 but Tabako refrained. When he saw through the continuity plan with Mar Roxas, Ramos made sure Duterte would run. Indeed, it is to Duterte’s credit that he didn’t become a Ramos puppet. That’s because it was never his nature to be one.
PNoy stands in contrast to all that. He had to rely on his inner circle even for the decision-making on the prognosis of his serious illness as Rene Almendras related during his eulogy. Aquino was a man-child and boy-king rolled into one. He couldn’t become his own man in his youth. He couldn’t become a real man even when he was President.",Others
Cory Aquino and the dumbing down of Philippine Media the root cause of decline in quality of Filipino legislators,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/cory-aquino-and-the-dumbing-down-of-philippine-media-the-root-cause-of-decline-in-quality-of-filipino-legislators/,"Harry Roque’s law partner Joel Ruiz Butuyan complains about the quality of Senators but doesn’t put the finer on who should be blamed. Butuyan writes in his Inquirer column “Comparing past and present senators” today of “the faces of senators of the past renowned for their brilliance, juxtaposed with pictures of senators of the present who are regularly ridiculed.”
But, see, that’s actually on the leaders who tolerated the culture of mediocrity. Prior to the 1986 “revolution” that toppled the government of President Ferdinand Marcos, how many actors won elective office? Only one if my memory serves me right, Joseph Estrada. Rogelio De La Rosa ran but withdrew from the race. Actors confined themselves to local government unit (LGU) races for Councilor.
It was the Cory Aquino administration which opened the floodgates to actors switching over to politics. This was made possible by the TV networks which switched over to totally gross programming standards. Pilipino became the norm. The nightly newscast and FM radio stations weren’t spared. Even the anchors themselves became celebrities in their own right which saw the election of Noli De Castro to the Senate and Ted Failon to Congress.
Butuyan writes…
According to people’s reminiscences of politics before the Marcos dictatorship began in 1972, politicians of those years captivated the masses with their eloquent speeches, and crowds trooped to election rallies to be enthralled by the oratorical brilliance of their leaders. Our parents and grandparents chose their leaders based on superior intelligence, sterling track record, impressive academic credentials, and unblemished reputation.
What Butuyan will not admit is standards were lowered post-Marcos. The bastardization of institutions went into high-gear. Post-graduate degrees were for sale. This is why government bureaucracy is in a sorry state as well. Appointees and career officials may meet the qualifying standards but don’t have either or both the competence and the experience. Sadly even the better educated on paper are also lackluster. Just look at Drilon and De Lima. The Vice-President takes the cake. She doesn’t articulate like a lawyer. You can’t make much out of her statements because they’re basically word salads in a mix of English and Pilipino.
The main culprit is the freewheeling liberal-leftist democracy we have. There is no emphasis on discipline and high standards for government service. Government has actually become the dumping ground of the mediocre. Contrast this with Singapore where potential leaders are subject to rigorous training in terms of educational background and experience. The Senators of today hire intelligent staff members to do their thinking and write speeches for them. Diligence is also sorely lacking. In place of this is complete staff work but this is dependent on the quality of the staff they hire. Good talent is also a rarity these days. What makes it worst is hiring is also not based on qualifications but connections and loyalty to the principal.
This is why we have barely competent elected and appointed officials occupying government posts. If we want the country to become respected then we should put in the hard work of reforms in the socio-political and economic aspects of society. Otherwise we will continue our descent into becoming a nation of morons.",Others
The @1Sambayan June 12 fiasco was a validation of Duterte and a vindication of Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-1sambayan-june-12-fiasco-was-a-validation-of-duterte-and-a-vindication-of-marcos/,"I was thinking of an epitaph piece for 1Sampayan yesterday after that fiasco of a launch. It seems the universe read my thoughts and here’s Randy David with his weekly Inquirer column. In today’s “Making the republic work”, David laments how “supposedly responsible and educated Filipinos” find appealing the idea “that a Sara Duterte-Rodrigo Duterte tandem might be the ideal team for the country in the 2022 presidential election”. He writes how “disturbing” this is, pointing out how…
It can only signify the final erosion of what is left of our national self-esteem, and the total distrust in the ability of the nation’s political class to govern.
Our problem as a nation runs deeper because on one side we have the “good” who claim they mean well even if they don’t. The other side of the equation are the “bad” who are supposedly the ills of society but are actually able to do some good. As a sociologist, David should know better what ails the country. It’s not really that hard to find the root cause. The political system is closely tied in to the socio-economic structure. This was the system of government the Spaniards put in place. A plantation-style theocracy which is why there is a parish in every town. The Americans didn’t bother to improve on these constructs because their immediate priority was subjugation.
The elite had bigger dreams — “Independence”. It was good working for the colonial masters but it was better if power was in their hands. We all know how the story goes. US priorities changed after World War II. Independence was granted but not totally. In effect, the elite became our new masters. The two-party system was nothing more than a political convenience. There was no practical ideology. Politics wasn’t issues-based. It was centered on politicians who were the feudal lords who controlled regional fiefdoms that could deliver the vote, legally and illegally if the need arose.
The infrastructure which was in place pre-war was never rebuilt post-war. The Americans shepherded the Japanese so they would be in their corner and we never got paid for the reparations due. The elites focused on rebuilding what they lost during the war. It was only after Ferdinand Marcos won the Presidency that major infrastructure projects were launched. Marcos had a vision for the country. Unfortunately it was clouded by Imeldific. The Rose of Tacloban, then First Lady Imelda Marcos, wasn’t prepared for her role and suffered a nervous breakdown. But after treatment, she got her head screwed on straight and was prepared for the role of her life.
The opposition during martial law were the elites displaced by Ang Bagong Lipunan. Marcos understood the need for a national identity to unite Filipinos. Thus the myth of Maharlika was born. The problem was the country wasn’t actually independent because the Americans were still lurking in the background. The Philippines still served as their first line of defense in the Pacific. It was also a staging area for any conflict in the region. The US bases played a crucial role in the Vietnam War and the coup in Indonesia which toppled Sukarno.
After Marcos was ousted, “democracy” was restored. Since then, the political dysfunction only got worse. The Yellows (partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) embarked on a cult-building indoctrination campaign and the Yellow Ribbon replaced the flag. Instead of the standard of excellence in government with the best and brightest, the culture of mediocrity was ushered in. The wholesale dismissal of officials who were identified with Marcos was part of the cult-building. None of the long-term development plans were retained. It became build-as-you-go. This is why the national capital region is the mess that it is now. Worst was the brain drain that took place. Most of the talented Filipinos left to work abroad. Government became the haven of the idiot and the indolent.
The Opposition finally reaped what they sowed yesterday, the 12th of June 2021. The 1Sambayan coalition didn’t have any viable candidates to present to the public nor did they have a platform. It was still the same old narrative from the Marcos era about “freedom and democracy”. No sooner after they named their bets that the same began issuing polite statements basically saying we don’t want anything to do with you. Democracy died yesterday because the Opposition committed political suicide. Instead of insults and destablization the Opposition should have focused on taking a fiscalizer role and working with the administration. They don’t have the patience and diligence to put in the hard work which only served to expose their lust for power and the absence of a genuine concern for the welfare of the Filipino people.
This is the vindication of Marcos. I have often wondered why his lineage could only be traced back to his parents. There is nothing to find after them. Marcos was obviously of Chinese descent. Up to today, Marcos remains an enigma. It will be thirty-six years in 2022 since the 1986 “revolution” toppled Marcos. That’s how long the reign of the Yellows lasted. It’s all but a formality now. It is imperative that a new opposition rise. Our more progressive regional neighbors are ahead in their nation-building process. We need to catch up. A genuine opposition would still uphold the best interests of the country first and work with the administration after the election. EDSA and “people power” should be thrown in the trash. It’s about time that we give the Constitution the respect it deserves. For that matter, we should amend or do away with the 1987 Constitution en toto.
The Chinese have said that in crisis, there is opportunity. In the midst of the pandemic where the only certainty is uncertainty exists the opportunity to rebuild and build back better. The Opposition will never admit that there have been gains in the last five years. Duterte didn’t make good on all of his campaign promises but he made good on those which have an immediate impact. The 2022 election is not a referendum on Duterte. It is validation for him and vindication for Marcos. Singapore has a democratic dictatorship. Perhaps what worked for them would also work for us.",Others
Philippine Opposition partisans remain stupid about political history because of idiots like Bart Guingona,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/philippine-opposition-partisans-remain-stupid-about-political-history-because-of-idiots-like-bart-guingona/,"The Philippine Opposition remain as stupid as they are this late into this election cycle because of all the wannabe artistahin “influencers” and “thought leaders” their partisans habitually tingala to. Thank the scars of our colonial past for that. Seeing this recent tweet of his, it becomes hard to really understand which planet Yellowidiot Bart Guingona lives on, for example.
What I do know is, I myself was a Yellowidiot from 1983 – 1987. The minute the 1987 Constitution was finished by the Constitutional Commission, however, I was done being one. There was some hope in the Fidel Ramos administration but the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program and the PEA-Amari scam (Public Estate Authority joint project with  Thailand-based development group Amari Coastal Development Corporation) dimmed that hope.
Following that, I knew from the onset that then President Joseph “Erap” Estrada wouldn’t finish his term. He was an outsider and had little experience wielding the levers of power. Erap needed a good and trustworthy adviser. But he had none. I didn’t like how Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) succeeded Erap but when she survived that coup attempt of sorts with the resignation of the Hyatt 10, she gained my respect. That increased after the 2008 financial crisis which barely affected the country. She put into place fiscal legislation which strengthened the economy even if highly unpopular and at a large cost to her political capital.
I wanted Erap to win in 2010 if only for him to be vindicated. Erap was offered exile but he didn’t accept it. He chose to make a stand. He may not have been detained at Muntinlupa but we now have a better idea of what house arrest means since the onset of the pandemic. I knew Noynoy Aquino was going to be a fuck-up but he was a shoo-in after former President Cory Aquino died. Either he got enough votes or the justification for fraud was there. Why? Look at how Erap came in second in that crowded field when he had to go up against Manny Villar with all his money.
I didn’t think Rodrigo Duterte would actually run to begin with. Having had four encounters with the man when he was Davao Mayor in the 90s, he wasn’t Presidential material but he wasn’t as stupid as he projected himself to be. His Matina “clubhouse,” where he held office, was filled with books. Duterte loved wine, women and song at that time, but he is also a voracious and wide reader. It’s reflected in his vocabulary when he speaks. In five years he has done what he could. It is not enough and his administration isn’t perfect but I don’t think for a moment that he has fallen short on what he could deliver under the circumstances. Noynoy’s flagship program were the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects but these did not have a palpable impact on the lives of the average Pinoy. Duterte will finish his term with infrastructure projects completed from Luzon to Mindanao. His legislative agenda hangs in the balance as there is still pending economic reform bills pending in Congress. He is rushing what he can get passed before June 30, 2022.
The Opposition should stop with their black propaganda and their obsolete appeal to emotions. They should be doing the hard work of developing an alternative platform of government to present to the people for the 2022 election. Instead of the vicious politicking since 2016, they should have taken their role of fiscalizer maturely and responsibly for the people they are supposed to serve. Gaslighting worked to their advantage during the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos and Erap. But it won’t now. The public has seen through their duplicity with their dumping GMA when they had a falling out. Noynoy’s being an idiot President was the last straw. That was the last time an appeal to emotion worked in their favor.
We need a mature and responsible opposition playing the fiscalizer role helping the government in nation-building. We don’t need an opposition who will focus on shortcuts to get back power through destablization and impeachment. This is why the national artist for literature, F. Sionil Jose, said that Duterte may yet be the greatest President after Magsaysay. History is not yet done with Rodrigo Duterte. But it is done with the Yellowidiots.",Others
Europe is erasing its history because Big Brother is watching,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/europe-is-erasing-its-history-because-big-brother-is-watching/,"Symbols of Western Europe’s irrevocable past as imperial powers are coming down as people take to the streets supposedly to protest racism and injustice. Historical symbols deemed “inappropriate” have become the targets of vandalism and removal petitions. In London, the statue of slave trader Robert Milligan has now been taken down from West India Quay. In Belgium, the statue of King Leopold II in Antwerp has also been removed.
What is next? Who is next?
George Orwell foretold all of what we are seeing today in 1949 in his prescient book 1984…
…every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.
Better get it done. Big Brother is watching.
Orwell’s story of a dystopian future where people are allowed to communicate only using a prescribed set of words and live under the watchful eye of “Big Brother” has come true. Big Brother today is the Political Correctness (PC) Police and their tool is social media. The “Party” consists of members of so-called Wokedom who enforce the use of their preferred correctspeak which assures society operates under a perpetual state of gender, ethnic, and historical confusion.
It’s an historical cleansing that aims to deny an entire generation the facts of their history and important features of their culture and society. And to think some of these very same members of the Party themselves get all crybaby over “historical revisionism”. The fact is, many Western European countries amassed their wealth and power on the back of brutal conquest and enslavement. Indeed, all of this is well-documented and this information examined by scholars in these societies’ academe and research organisations where free inquiry reigns supreme.
The culture of free inquiry that had transformed much of Western Europe from fearful superstitious societies into nations of exploration, conquest, and wealth creation is seemingly under threat now that the technology exists to implement a true Big Brother as Orwell envisioned it. The irony that escapes the Party is that much of the wealth and surplus time and headspace that enables liberalism — and its perverted offspring, woke culture — to flourish today was built on this very lust for conquest and exploration.
Perhaps, by focusing too much attention on what are really just quaint symbols, wokedom are highlighting more the reality that the winners (regardless of how right or wrong they happen to be) get to write history. Back in 2015, Warner Brothers, owners of the iconic Dukes of Hazzard franchise terminated the licensing of “General Lee” toys. This followed a shooting incident in the US state of South Carolina in which nine African Americans were gunned down in a church by white gunman Dylann Roof.
The Dukes of Hazzard was a popular series that aired on CBS from 1979 to 1985. The General Lee was the iconic 1969 Dodge Charger that was at the centre of the hit show. It sported an image of the Confederate flag on its roof. The Confederate flag, which was flown by a confederacy of secessionist slave states that fought Union troops in the US Civil War, has long been regarded as a symbol of American slavery and general redneckery. On the other hand, southern Americans also see it as a symbol of their culture and heritage.
Because of the shooting tragedy in South Carolina, calls to eradicate the flag from American culture and history grew and big retailers like Walmart started refusing to sell the flag. But is the Confederate flag or, for that matter, any icon or image really that important a symbol of racism or (again for that matter) any social movement, belief, or tradition?
Like those “offensive” statutes, the swastika and, the Confederate flag, the crucifix, for example, was also a potent symbol that rallied people to perpetrate hideous atrocities, perhaps at scales that likely dwarf the numbers of lives lost to Nazism and American and European slavery. But unlike the swastika and the Confederate flag (and perhaps other statues and symbols to be taken down in the future), the crucifix still hangs at the altars and facades of the Catholic Church’s towering edifices. And why not? The Roman Catholic Church is one of the winners of centuries of genocidal religious warfare and ethnic cleansing. Why, for example, are Native Americans not offended by the crucifix when this was a symbol hoisted on poles and displayed in fluttering flags when Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro brought to bear the full force of the Inquisition upon the Inca people in the 16th Century in what is now modern-day Peru?
Maybe some people just have so much idle time on their hands that they are able to go about life being pissed off about a statue or symbol. Interestingly enough, it is the racist Danny Vinyard played by Edward Furlong in the 1998 film American History X who quipped, “Life’s too short to be pissed off all the time. It’s just not worth it.” Perhaps wokedom should take some lessons from the very characters they love to hate.
Where does it end? If humanity leaves wokedom to its extreme devices, it will end up in such an Orwellian future. In fact, we may already be in it. Big Brother is watching.",Others

A Few Facts About the Arbitration Against China.
Florin T. Hilbay
I read with amusement and disappointment retired Justice Antonio Carpio’s 1 July 2021 piece in the Inquirer. Let me take this opportunity to point out falsehoods and inaccuracies in his story, and tell the nation a few facts about this interesting case.
During my time as Solicitor General of the Republic, I served as “agent” in the arbitration between the Philippines and China. An agent is the sole and formal representative of the State, with full authority to speak for and bind the nation. I was appointed by authority of President Noynoy Aquino. I’m pointing this out from the get-go not to brag about my role but to establish my “skin in the game” — I was the legally accountable officer and my actions as agent were the official acts of government. What is narrated here takes from this background.
On the other hand, Justice Carpio’s formal designation was, as he correctly pointed out, that of an “observer”- he had no direct and formal relationship with Pres. Aquino; was not officially part of the legal team that handled the case; and did not have any authority to speak for or bind the Republic during the arbitration. While his expertise on the matter is a given, as an observer, he had no skin in the game. And yet, he has somehow positioned himself as the voice on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) case, with authority to make accusations and insinuations ex cathedra.
First. When I assumed the position of Solgen, the WPS arbitration was a mess, given what was done to the former agent. J. Carpio had accused then Solgen and agent Francis Jardeleza of betraying the nation because of his actions related to the WPS. Consequently, J. Carpio opposed Jardeleza’s nomination to the Supreme Court (SC). He made the accusations notwithstanding that he only had second-hand information-he was never part of the team that discussed the WPS case at the palace and shouldn’t even have had access to confidential memos used as basis for the charges.
Despite the accusations, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) voted to recommend Jardeleza to the SC. One of those who voted for Jardeleza was then Sec. of Justice Leila de Lima, a member of the President’s legal team with personal knowledge of facts. When the objection was raised before the SC, J. Carpio’s own colleagues rejected his allegations and also voted for Jardeleza. Finally, Pres. Aquino himself appointed Jardeleza to the SC, with full knowledge of the then public allegations of J. Carpio. This history of embarrassing rejections should have merited the deepest of apologies to J. Jardeleza, a batchmate at UPLaw.
That the JBC, SC, and the President rebuffed these grave allegations should also have warranted, under fair conditions, an investigation of the thrice-rebuked accuser. It is worth reiterating here that the allegations were made by an outsider to the case even as the insiders themselves the authoritative decisionmakers, from Pres. Aquino down to his cabinet members -saw no problem with the actions of the country’s agent, J. Jardeleza.
Second. Prior to all this ruckus, I was informed by one of my legal assistants who used to work for J. Carpio that research was being done on how to legally justify the appointment of a sitting member of the SC as agent in the WPS arbitration. At the time, I didn’t even know: (1) what an agent meant-it was the first time I had heard of the term in the context of an arbitration, a field unfamiliar to me; (2) that then Solgen Jardeleza was in fact already the agent in the case.
Suffering from this ignorance, I even told this assistant that the model for that plan was the case of Justice Robert Jackson of the United States SC, who acted as prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials. It was only later on-to my horror-that I realized what all these prior events may have meant. In fairness to J. Carpio, I do not know if he knew what his staff was allegedly researching on, but if he did, then it placed him in a serious moral hazard when he made his accusations against J. Jardeleza.
Third. Given this politicized atmosphere, I sought to avoid being appointed as agent in the case. I already had a lot on my plate, and had no intention of butting heads with giants in the palace or any interloper for that matter. I was young, poor, unknown, did not belong to any organization, and had no powerful patrons. I also initially worried about my lack of rapport with the President’s trusted lawyers-ES Ochoa and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel (now Justice) Ben Caguioa. While they weren’t opposed to my appointment as Solgen, my understanding is that they supported their classmate, then Usec. (now Sec. of Justice) Meynard Guevara, a very kind and competent lawyer. What amounted to an ally in the cabinet at the time was Sec. Butch Abad (who belonged to a different faction) simply because the OSG handled the budget cases that were so controversial at the time. I thus held a powerful office, but had no political base myself. This was fine by me-I saw it as my claim to independence-though it also meant I was vulnerable.
To be sure, I certainly wanted to avoid having to go through the hell that J. Jardeleza just underwent. The publicity (and the eyebrow-raising campaign) generated by the charges leveled by J. Carpio clearly indicated that the WPS case was not just about the country’s case against China, but was also a power play among factions and interests. I didn’t want to be in the eye of that storm; it was a big wave I didn’t want to ride. I could only laugh seeing myself as a Frodo Baggins, minus the fellowship. I therefore made the formal request to ES Ochoa to have someone else handle the WPS case. That request, though initially accepted, was ultimately rejected. I became the agent.
Fourth. I had a challenging relationship Mr. Paul Reichler, the American external counsel hired by J. Jardeleza. Reichler is justifiably a legend, his competence in his field and showmanship in court quite unparalleled. While we agreed for the most part, we had an awkward relationship and at times argued quite intensely.
The core problem was his insistence on proposing joint development between the Philippines and China as a compromise in case we lose the so-called Itu Aba issue. In fairness to Reichler, he was consistent from the day we met until the hearing on the merits in trying to convince me to sign on to a strategy that would justify joint development. I rejected all these proposals for a compromise. (I’ve written about these events in a now public memo to ES Ochoa and J. Caguioa. I’ve also written about it in an article with the Ateneo Law Journal), Truth is, the Itu Aba issue was simply a proxy for the debate over joint development. I was against joint development because it is impermissible as a matter of constitutional law (my area of expertise). With specific reference to China, we simply can’t enter into an economic compromise with a country that doesn’t respect our full sovereign rights.
The other issue were the professional fees incurred by gov’t. This was a serious matter because public funds were being used and the ones accountable were the signatories — myself, ES Ochoa, and Sec. Abad. Politically as well, the palace worried some people were being made to believe their views were important when in all likelihood, the only reason they were being considered was because the gov’t was being billed for them. I politely declined the mild suggestion to consider terminating services of external counsel, as it would have created a greater mess instead of a happy solution.
Fifth. Given Reichler’s views on joint development, I put myself on the lookout for anyone in the team supportive of that project. At the time, the only one in mind was Sec. of Foreign Affairs Albert del Rosario. This was because, in an earlier conversation with Senator Trillanes, he informed me that he believed Sec. Del Rosario was for joint development. Secondly, I immediately noticed Consul General Henry Bensurto (a knowledgeable, but wildly unpopular trusted assistant to Sec. Del Rosario on WPS matters) was in full agreement with Reichler on joint development.
In hindsight, I should have just immediately asked Sec. del Rosario his views on joint development. Sec. Albert is a great diplomat and an adorable, credible, and charming grandfather with a business background. I can understand why, from a diplomat’s and a businessman’s standpoint, a joint development to explore oil and gas in the Reed Bank might be a sound political option. But I simply held a different view and, as agent, had full authority to follow my own heart and mind. The call was mine to make and I refused to be labeled, in J. Jardeleza’s term, “a joint developer.” Strategically as well, I also thought that we should fully commit to winning the arbitration in its entirely and avoid unnecessarily injecting political and economic considerations which might undermine our cause and signal to the arbitrators a potential weakness.
I flagged this concern over joint development with all the insiders-Pres. Aquino, the legal team at the palace, my own team at the OSG, two of Sec. del Rosario’s assistants in the WPS case (the late Amb. Nitoy Valeriano and Amb. Ed de Vega). Seeking a media-savvy ally, I also informed an outsider, J. Carpio, but he dismissed my concerns. From that point on, I suspected he was also in favor of a deal with China.
Sixth. The situation came to a head during the hearing on the merits, where joint development became the sore point of conflict. Prior to the hearing and before leaving for The Hague, I got a call from Reichler where he proposed, yet again, that we signal our openness to joint development. Again, I said no.
At The Hague, I was given copies of the draft speeches of the various speakers for the Philippine team. One draft, that of Prof. Bernie Oxman, included Reichler’s offer of a compromise by way of joint development. I objected to the language, which brought us to the meeting J. Carpio refers to in his Inquirer piece. Entering that meeting, I knew I was in for a debate with Reichler and that he would probably be supported by Sec. del Rosario. To my surprise, that meeting included the observer, J. Carpio. I thought it was inapproriate that an outsider would be included, but did not openly complain. I maintained my opposition to the present language of the draft which included a proposal for joint development and insisted that counsel fully commit to the wave and ride out the full force of our arguments. In frustration, I emphatically declared that “I will not be the Solgen that sold this case to China!” That seemed to have sobered the other side.
J. Carpio states erroneously that I was instructing Reichler and company to flat-out refuse to answer any questions posed by the tribunal. In fact, all I wanted Reichler to do was answer consistent with my views against joint development. It was my right, as agent, to reject an offer of compromise I found unacceptable. I never even bothered to respond to J. Carpio — to agree or disagree with him — simply because he had no authority to attend that meeting in the first place. The meeting was adjourned and we decided to meet again.
In the next meeting. I decided to bring additional witnesses, Sec. Ronald Llamas (a close friend of the President) and former Senator Rodolfo Biazon (a great soldier and statesman). My additional purpose in bringing Sec. Llamas was this-in the event Reichler insisted again on including joint development, I would instruct Sec. Llamas to directly contact the President to inform him that the external counsel was resisting my instructions and undermining the case. That meeting, surprisingly, proceeded without fuss and ended abruptly. Sec. Llamas jokingly asserted the foreign lawyers were intimidated by my two bodyguards. In the end, I got what I wanted: the reference to joint development was deleted and the speech delivered by Prof. Oxman was brilliant. I emailed to thank and congratulate the esteemed academic.
Seventh. J. Carpio complains about an attempt to somehow exclude him as an “observer” during the hearings on jurisdiction at The Hague. Here’s the inside story.
The truth is, save for Sec. Albert and myself, almost no one among the proposed attendees wanted to attend the hearings if J. Carpio and J. Jardeleza were present, given the history between these gentlemen. I was told people were worried of a public altercation between the two old men. But Reichler requested a sizable contingent of VIPs to show the tribunal our seriousness and I agreed it was a good idea. The hearings drew nearer and we still couldn’t send our list of attendees to The Hague.
In desperation, I told ES Ochoa and J. Caguioa that to finally solve the matter I would pay J. Carpio a visit at the SC. Once there, I told him our awkward situation and asked for his assurance that he would behave during the hearings on the promise that I would seek the same guaranty from J. Jardeleza. He graciously agreed. At The Hague, we were able bring a good crowd of VIPs, for which the administration was criticized for promoting a junket. With help from Philippine ambassador to The Hague Jet Ledda, J. Carpio and J. Jardeleza were “socially distanced” from each other the entire time. These were some of the things I had to deal with as agent.
J. Carpio believes there were two single-minded factions within the Philippine team during this arbitration. This is the view of an outsider, which naturally misses out on the nuanced interplay among the actual players in the game. The reality is that the players were independent republics of various sizes, with interests and goals of their own. Some of them had actual skin in the game.
Eight. Given all these, I hope people understand when I say that when the decision came out in 12 July 2016, I felt a sense of relief more than happiness. Prior to promulgation, I felt guns of blame were aimed at me the moment any sign of defeat was written into the decision. But even this relief was tempered by the fact that I had little hope that the incoming administration would pursue the stance taken by Pres. Aquino.
With this in mind, I later on wrote in an op-ed with the Inquirer my position on joint development with China, stating that such proposed agreement is a “Trojan Horse in the West Philippine Sea” because such economic agreement would not only be unconstitutional but worse, lead to a potential waiver of our victory in the WPS.
Ninth. I was not surprised when the Duterte administration announced that it was entering into a “Memorandum of Understanding” with China with respect to joint oil and gas exploration in the WPS. This is the foundational agreement that leads to a joint development with China. In interviews, I pointed out that the model for this “MOU” incorporates the views of China on joint development in its dealings with former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a known ally of China. Any deal that flows from that MOU is therefore deeply problematic.
It also didn’t surprise me that both J. Carpio and Sec. del Rosario, in separate statements, have come out openly and repeatedly to fully endorse this compromise agreement with China. Their favorable views on this deal with China are publicly accessible. In all honesty, I find it unfortunate that J.Carpio, from defending the WPS, now happily descends to join this administration and China by lending his credibility to provide legal cover to this rotten deal. He even personally assures us that this compromise with China is “safe.” Does he really believe that China would be stupid enough to impliedly recognize our victory at The Hague by contract, even as everything that they’ve wanted, they’ve been able to get from President Duterte?
Tenth. In the final analysis, the one person who had the most skin in the game was Pres. Aquino. The decision to fight China and place the nation’s stock on the line was his and his alone. Regardless of what the lawyers, diplomats, economists, and generals may have told Pres. Aquino, this most difficult decision of his term was purely political, borne of courage of spirit and moral strength, not knowledge of any discipline. In my view, 99.99% of the credit over our victory in the WPS rightfully belongs to him. Without his courage to fight, there would have been no case to begin with. I also suggest to anyone and everyone who claims or believes that they have a rightful share in the balance of that credit-all.01% of it-to just burn it and throw away its ashes in honor of a great former president.

If Retired Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario had been for joint development of oil and gas resources with China all along, what was the reason for the Philippines spending P1 billion on the case? Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) had signed a joint-exploration agreement with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) back in 2004. A seismic survey had been conducted. Could it be that the case was filed only at the instigation of the US to give it cover in its continuing conduct of freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS) in the South China Sea? Was it a PR job to massage the passage of EDCA? Was it meant to finesse the implementation of then President Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia strategy? Or was it all of the mentioned in support of Uncle Sam’s initiatives with PNoy’s explicit blessing for continuing US support of his belligerent stand against China? Only Carpio and Del Rosario can and should enlighten the Filipino people whom they have been agitating to act against the pro-China stand of the President.
Malampaya’s reserves are projected to run out by 2024. Our power generation industry is firmly in the hands of oligarchs. More expensive renewable energy is being rammed down our throats and we’re already paying a feed-in tariff in our monthly Meralco bill. Nuclear is cheaper and cleaner but no one has been paying heed to its number one advocate former Congressman Mark Cojuangco. The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant has been idle since its completion and an annual budget is still set aside for its maintenance.

"Thank Ninoy for the holiday, I guess",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/thank-ninoy-for-the-holiday-i-guess/,"The greatest “heroic” act Ninoy Aquino did was to die face down on the tarmac of the Manila International Airport. Other than that, he was all optics and hot air, reminiscent of the vice-president today.
He didn’t die for the Filipinos, he died for his ambition. And it paid off for his wife and son.
Even his death was suspect. At the time, he was already dying from a heart condition. He refused to get treatment here, fearing Marcos’ “duplicity” which might get him killed through some medical “accident.”
And if he was indeed dying, then he was deemed better dead “assassinated” than dying from a heart attack. It’s good publicity.
There was no subsequent investigation on his death. The “investigations” all stopped abruptly and one Rolando Galman was pointed as gunman and Marcos as mastermind.
So here’s the thing: Marcos–let’s admit to it–was a brilliant man. Would it be really logical for someone like him to kill his most bitter political opponent at a time when the opposition is gaining ground and when he was gaining more and more enemies day-by-day?
I am no Marcos supporter, but really, things don’t add up.
Here’s some truth, though: Ninoy was no hero. Far from it. History is the ultimate judge and his purported legacy is being judged harshly.
Still, I guess we have to thank him for the one day holiday.",Others
The world will not wait for the Philippines to recover from COVID-19,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/the-world-will-not-wait-for-the-philippines-to-recover-from-covid-19/,"“Humanity” and all the goodness around empathy and charity sound nice on paper but, eventually, people and the rest of the world with clear pathways to the future move on. Those that are at risk of being left behind — the chronic poor, the sick and dying, and the not-so-smart — while entitled to some extent to the support of the “more fortunate” are faced with grim options. Grim as these options may be, the “well off” also have their limits. Empathy is not an infinite resource. At some point one needs to look out for Number One.
That the Philippines is in the situation that it is in today is not surprising. Even back in mid-April, the prognosis was clearly stark for the country and its enormous population of more than 100 million.
The haves with many options to draw from will continue to encourage compliance to the measures in place to stop the spread of the disease. The have-nots with few options — and even fewer things to lose — will, at some point, decide that getting back to the daily grind outdoors is worth the risk of catching the disease. It’s simple, really. Ultimately, complying to the lockdown will be a cost-benefit analysis.
It’s not much different from the decision making the average jeepney driver makes everyday. For the typical jeepney driver, it is a daily choice between driving a barely-roadworthy vehicle with faulty brakes while breathing in Manila’s toxic atmosphere or seeing himself and his family starve to death. It’s a no-brainer. When the novelty of the novel coronavirus wears out and the Philippines’ teeming masses decide that, between social distancing and making a living, choosing the latter is a no-brainer, the threat of acquiring COVID-19 becomes the equivalent of just another day risking life and limb driving a jeepney.
Is it the government’s fault that the Philippines now exhibits the worst track record of handling this pandemic? It is easy to argue that and the Opposition, thanks to their habitual lazy thinking and no-platform situation, works within that easy space. The fact is, the Philippines had long been ill-equipped to manage even normal public health concerns. Just the fact of its unreliable water supply and a waste management system that routinely dumps refuse into the Philippines’ waterways and coastal areas already makes the country a massive ticking health bomb.
The biggest issue of all is population. We are talking here an enormous population when measured against economic capacity. More importantly, the value of life in the Philippines is a confronting function of the inescapable law of supply-and-demand. More supply crushes commodity prices. The medieval attitudes towards health and safety proving this can be seen everywhere — a fact called that out too in mid-April.
Open manholes, sewage bubbling up at their front doors, hanging by the fingers off jeepneys and buses on their commutes to and from work, dining on pagpag, and even pimping their own kids to paedophiles — where does COVID-19 rank against those dangers working Filipinos eat for breakfast everyday? Very likely very much the same way a paper cut stacks up against a broken arm. In the long run COVID-19 will be just another one of those things that form par for the course in Filipinos’ lives.
People don’t care? That’s because care, like empathy, is a finite resource spread across 100 million warm bodies. This is why the field of statistics was invented — because only a practical — a clinical — way is essential when regarding enormous numbers. Indeed, as I said back then…
In fact [rich people have] never seen life the way poor people do — which is why the Philippines’ elite cocoon themselves in their chi chi gated subdivisions and chauffeur their kids to schools rather than encourage them to take public transport. COVID-19 will just be another wedge that insulates the rich from the poor. To the already high perimeter walls of the rich’s gated communities will be added more measures to socially-distance themselves from the rest of the Philippines.
The average Filipino shouldn’t take it personally when they are regarded as a statistic. Because most Filipinos are poor, live in dense “informal” settlements, and have few options, how’d they fare and behave in a pandemic such as this is quite predictable. Back-of-the-envelope elementary school statistics back in April painted the picture we are now seeing today. It’s not rocket science.
So here’s the bottom line folks: Told ya so.
The Opposition are, quite simply, being dishonest in the way they sustain their shrill “activism” but offer no solution. That’s because there is no solution. COVID-19 will ravage through the Philippines just as typhoons that hit the islands year in and year out do the same job — because Filipinos, left to their devices, lack the means to save themselves.
There’s a silver lining to all this, of course. We can take some interesting lessons from English history where at one time English labour was so valuable following the decimation of her majesty’s population by the plague, that her feudal administrators at the time actually had to implement a maximum wage law to curb skyrocketing labour costs. This, from The History of England – Foundation by Peter Ackroyd…
Yet the pestilence had slow but permanent effects on English society. The shortage of labour [as a result of the population decline] had the immediate result of increasing both the level of wages and the chances of employment. The phenomenon of the landless or impoverished peasant wholly disappeared. But the rising demands of the working people who had survived, their worth now doubled by the epidemic, provoked a reaction from the landowners and magnates. The knights of the shires, in particular, perceived a threat to good order.
An Ordinance of Labourers was passed by a parliament in 1349, forbidding employers to pay more for labour than they had before the pestilence. The same Act deemed that it was illegal for an unemployed man to refuse work. The measures were not realistic. Many workers and their families could simply move to another district and to a more generous employer who was willing to ignore the law. Some migrated to towns, for example, where there was great demand for manual labourers such as masons and carpenters. A ploughman might become a tiler. More than enough work was available.
[…]
Many younger people now possessed their own holdings of land. And the best land did not remain vacant for long. There had once been too many farmers and labourers working too little soil, but now they were dispersed over the countryside.
The real lesson here is this: Never waste a good crisis. There will always be winners just as we are now seeing the millions of losers in this latest “natural” disaster hitting the Philippines. The solution may not be the solution wokedom was looking for but, one way or another, a new world will emerge out of this blip in history we are currently living through. History celebrates winners. Losers, on the other hand, will occupy a bit of token space in the small print of the world’s history books. The Philippines needs to decide which part of those books she wants to see the story of her people told.",Others
Catholic churches should be demolished because pagan people’s lives ALSO matter,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/catholic-churches-should-be-demolished-because-pagan-peoples-lives-also-matter/,"While people are in the business of tearing down monuments to slave traders and brutal colonisers, why not go further and turn people’s ires on Roman Catholic Church buildings and statues? After all, the Catholic Church has as blood-soaked a history as any other global imperial empire.
The crucifix, for example, was a potent symbol that rallied people to perpetrate hideous atrocities, perhaps at scales that likely dwarf the numbers of lives lost to Nazism and American and European slavery. But unlike, say, the swastika, the crucifix still hangs at the altars and facades of the Catholic Church’s towering edifices. And why not? The Roman Catholic Church is one of the winners of centuries of genocidal religious warfare and ethnic cleansing.
Why, for example, are Native Americans not offended by the crucifix when this was a symbol hoisted on poles and displayed in fluttering flags when Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro brought to bear the full force of the Inquisition upon the Inca people in the 16th Century in what is now modern-day Peru? Fast forward to more recent times and consider the case for the proposed canonization of Pope Pius XII who many criticise for being silent on Nazi atrocities as a wartime sovereign of the Vatican. In his article “The Holocaust and the Catholic Church” published on The Atlantic, acclaimed author James Carroll wrote;
If Pius XII were to be named a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, more than the restoration of his reputation would result. His policy of silence about Nazi atrocities would be justified.
Perhaps it is because the Catholic Church is far more clever. Where it failed to decimate heretics and pagans, it, instead, converted people to believers. So successful were they and the broader Christendom at justifying themselves, in fact, that the most powerful military societies of today stretching over much of Eurasia and North America were founded upon Christian values. In this way, the Church had installed a vast global insurance against vilification by the people it had oppressed over two millennia.
It would, of course be impractical to take the Church to task on its history of oppression seeing that most of the people it had oppressed had not only moved on but embraced its dogma and built successful societies founded on its core principles. The point is, history moves only one way — forward. The past remains inaccessible to change beyond the imperfect record of it kept in human-created artifacts. Obliterating these artifacts may make the record inaccessible to future generations, but it will not change the outcomes of what happened in the past.
Those who seek satisfaction in destroying historical record that they deem “inappropriate” should step back and think about what they really aim to achieve. In changing people’s perceptions of the past, do they really think the future their current trajectory is taking them will change? Food for thought right there.",Others
Opposition pleas to “remember” the “horrors” of the “Martial Law Years” starting to sound pathetic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/opposition-pleas-to-remember-the-horrors-of-the-martial-law-years-starting-to-sound-pathetic/,"Listen. Can you hear that? It’s the sound of the wailings of the Martial Law Crybabies. One wonders why they need to wax crybaby ad nauseum over the “horrors” of them “Martial Law Years” to anyone who cares to listen when they’ve already spent hundreds of millions of pesos on monuments, statues, two Aquino presidencies, and even on entire broadcast media mega-corporations to channel their narrative to the Filipino public. Still all that isn’t enough. Instead of these investments yielding returns in the form of eliciting awe and reverence in Filipinos, they have become mere punchlines in the ongoing joke that is the Opposition Yellowtard “platform”.
The latest toy the Martial Law Crybabies now crow about is the so-called “Freedom Memorial Museum” to be constructed in the chi chi Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines.
“We want to translate the story of the martial law era into the architectural design, to give meaning and experience during martial law. It’s not our architecture, it’s the architecture of the Filipino people and our history,” [one of its architects Mark Anthony Pait] said.
One wonders though. Shouldn’t the design be depicting the iconic “L” hand gesture of the Yellowtard “cause” rather than a fist that tends more to be associated to the personal brand of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? Then again who am I to comment on architectural concepts, right? The more important point here is this is just another new edifice commemorating the “brutal” government of former President Ferdinand Marcos and, of course, the “heroism” of the late former Senator Ninoy Aquino Jr seeing that “the restored Aviation Security Command (Avsecom) military van which brought Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.’s body to the hospital will serve as the museum’s centerpiece.” But of course, right?
The real measure of how effective these “reminders” are will, of course, be how many votes the Martial Law Crybabies will be attracting come 2022. As with most elections, this is an important one. The Yellowtards will be running on the usual “No to Tyranny” platform and will likely draw political capital from these icons and monuments. Good luck with that. Perhaps it might help to at least include alternatives and solutions to the Opposition proposition. Then again that’s all too hard. Spending a million bucks — or ten — on another Yellowtard “memorial” is way easier.",Others
The Opposition wastes time lying to themselves and to Filipinos about history and about Duterte,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/the-opposition-wastes-time-lying-to-themselves-and-to-filipinos-about-history-and-about-duterte/,"The Opposition can’t disabuse themselves of the notion that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a Chinese puppet. PhilSTAR columnist Boo Chanco, for example, is fixated on the concept as is evident in yet another one of his pieces, today’s “Is China losing Duterte” where he suggests that “China will likely finance a candidate next year. The Manchurian Candidate will likely be someone endorsed by Duterte.”
This reminds me of the columns that Kit Tatad wrote during the first year of the administration. Most were a disconnect between Tatad’s intellectual capabilities against the quality of the theories he was positing. Is there going to be a China candidate in next year’s polls? This sounds to me like a ripoff from the Democrats notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a hand in former US President Donald Trump’s election. The similarities end there. Both Trump and Duterte weren’t expected to win but they did. The Opposition is engaged in gaslighting. There I said it.
The illusions about pandemic response, the South China Sea disputes, and the corruption are all designed to manipulate voters into believing that whoever the administration candidate is will do more of the same. As correctly pointed out by former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile (JPE), the President should pay no heed to these accusations. There is much that gets lost in the wash and time is wasted. Think of it this way, the Japanese committed atrocities against Filipinos during the war. Why is no one fanning anti-Japanese sentiment? China has never invaded the country. Why is the Opposition encouraging Filipinos to hate China? The world’s second oldest Chinatown is located in Manila. That’s how far back our relationship goes. Conversely why not talk of a US candidate? Then US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg clearly conveyed that the US wasn’t inclined to a Duterte Presidency. Should we accept the dictates of the Americans as a former colony?
What has become evident now is the Panglinan and Lopez groups will not allow another Duterte or a proxy, or another Marcos to become President. The issues the opposition have brought forth against Duterte are all their patron’s issues. A case in point is the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP). This was paid for by Filipinos but hasn’t been commissioned. It stands as a silent monument to the foibles of the Opposition. In his book, The Politics of Business: How the Government Tried My Case Without Me, the late industrialist Herminio T. Disini wrote…
The decision to mothball the BNPP had severe consequences for the Philippine economy, particularly its power generation sector, which experienced severe shortages in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, result ing in crippling brownouts all over the archipelago. In Luzon, there were 8-, 12- and even 16-hour rotating brownouts for months on end. Despite the decision to close the plant, the Philippine government continued to make huge payments on it-a debt burden that would total about P120 billion when the last install ment was paid in 2007-without gaining a single kilo watt of electricity from the mothballed plant
The government could have repudiated the debt if it truly knew and could prove that the transaction was corrupt. Tellingly, it did not because it knew that if it did that, its creditors would make kindling of it in the courts. In the meanwhile, well-placed entrepreneurs close to the Aquino and the succeeding Fidel Ramos ad ministrations made a killing selling generators and set ting up shop as independent power producers or IPPS.
The Philippine government went on to sue West inghouse in New Jersey on charges of bribery while Westinghouse sued in the Swiss civil arbitration court. In both cases, the Philippine government lost; no bribery was established. Those decisions parenthetically cleared me. In the meantime, I, who had been accused of passing on untold millions to President Marcos from my commission in the Westinghouse deal, was cleared by an audit performed by Coopers & Lybrand, one of the five largest international accounting firms of impeccable integrity and expertise.
Former Pangasinan Rep. Mark Cojuangco has argued himself hoarse about how nuclear is the cheapest and cleanest form of energy to no avail. The option to rehabilitate it was on the table in 2017 but the Senators thumbed it down. This had more to do with the availability of campaign funds than the benefit it will bring to Filipinos who are now subject to the second highest power rates in the region.
This is why all this talk of a China candidate is crap. If this were really the case then former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro should’ve won in 2010 because he was then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s anointed. Instead we got stuck with Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III. There is more basis to believe that the the US would want a friendlier President to be able to use rhe country like a loaded gun pointed at China’s head. To my mind, this is what we should be wary of.",Others
Battle of the Heroes: NAIA name change vs. Ferdinand Marcos Day,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/battle-of-the-heroes-naia-name-change-vs-ferdinand-marcos-day/,"Whether you refer to heroes here as with or without the quotation marks, “heroes” in the Philippines appear to be defined by how well you can get history to side on you. And what better way to do that than name recall? So for anyone wanting to be remembered as a hero, naming roads and public buildings, erecting statues and commemorating special days are just about the most effective techniques in the country. But why is this important? Well, just ask the descendants of these heroes who are out to benefit during election day.
It looks like the tide is turning these days with Ninoy increasingly being portrayed as a fake hero, traitor and terrorist (dying only in pursuit of his political agenda), while Macoy is steadily gaining ground in cementing his legacy as the genuine contributor to the country’s development and progress as World War II veteran, distinguished legislator, and former president.
No less than presidential son Paolo Duterte (along with 2 other Congressmen) is authoring the bill in Congress to rename NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) into anything but after the Yellow Icon. House Bill 7031 seeks to change the airport’s name to the Paliparang Pandaigdig ng Pilipinas.
This move has been met with mixed reactions across the spectrum of minds: Filipinos who have snapped out of the Yellow spell welcome this with a resounding Amen, with a sigh of relief that their clamor for this is finally being heard.
One netizen, Jun Dx2, had these kind words to say…
I don’t care what they rename NAIA with but just remove the name of that fake hero, yellowshit patriarch and co-founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines out!
But as to the timing of doing this in the midst of a pandemic, Senator Risa Hontiveros reacted:
branding the proposal as “ill-timed and insensitive” would be an “understatement.”
Meanwhile Top Yellow Honcho of the Land, Leni Robredo, had a clanging tricycle-load of Taglish to unleash:
“Nasa gitna tayo ng pandemya, ito pa talaga ang maiisip natin?”
“Where is our sense of history?”
“Ngayon pa talaga kung kailan dapat all hands on deck tayo na nagtutulong-tulong para masugpo ‘yung pandemya, ngayon pa ‘yan iisipin?”
Did they ever consider that re-branding the former winner of “Worst Airport of the Year” Awards towards a positive image at a time when our tourism is at its bleakest is actually good timing and a great marketing opportunity in anticipation of our reopening to the world?
On the other side of the court, the House had just stamped their approval on a bill declaring Sept. 11 ‘President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos Day’ in Ilocos Norte, which makes it a special nonworking holiday in the North to commemorate the birth anniversary of the former president.
Senator Sotto affirmed he would not object to the measure:
former President Marcos was a son of Ilocos Norte and he remains, to this day, a hero not only to the people of Ilocos Norte but also to most Ilocanos all over the world.
He expects the bill such as this with local application to breeze through the Senate.
Apparently at the end of the day a person will be measured by his/her accomplishments and achievements, and not by how many people one has duped into following his “the Filipino is worth dying for” Cult.
Considering the steep fall from the heyday of Yellow euphoria to the sheer shame of getting labelled a Dilawan or Yellowtard these days, all Ninoy and Cory can probably say at this point is “It was good while it lasted!”",Others
"Strong nation, iron fist rule may be the path forward for the Philippines",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/strong-nation-iron-fist-rule-may-be-the-path-forward-for-the-philippines/,"Is Professor Randy David giving up on liberal democracy and being a progressive leftist militant? The ideology of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) is based on Maoist principles and yet, it is convenient for them to mouth insults and pro-Philippine epithets against their former patrons. Yet here is David seemingly touching on the hard truth in his piece Inquirer today “America and China: A tale of two systems”…
China’s eradication of mass poverty, its sustained growth, and its successful elevation to middle class status of a sizable segment of its population, appear to validate the vision of a strong nation led by a strong single-party State. Alas, it is democratic America that seems to be languishing economically, its institutions unable to fully arrest the drift toward populist authoritarianism.
The economic rise of China appears to be a Deng Xiao Ping and Lee Kuan Yew collaboration. Singapore can afford a certain level of “democracy” because of its population. China can’t because it has over a billion people. The US has a population of 320M and look at where it is at presently. The divide which brought the US Civil War on has been rekindled because the reforms weren’t put in place after the war ended with Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. The civil rights movement of the 60s ended with the Kennedy brothers’ assassination. Johnson did what he could but the Vietnam War prevented him from seeking another term. Trump’s win over Clinton in 2016 validated the sentiment that Roger Ailes realized when he organized Fox News for Rupert Murdoch.
Most liberals don’t realize the irony of how their desire for huge profits is one of the reasons why the social divide in the US has grown wider. America’s immigration problem is largely the result of its need for cheaper labor. The result is a potent mixture for unrest as what happened last January at the Capitol. What’s more interesting is the similarities between American liberal elitist mindsets with that of their Filipino counterparts. The landlocked states are the equivalent of the bobotantes Filipino elitists use to refer to the masses. What the Pinoy elitists don’t realize is the masses are waking up to the reality. They were largely responsible for the win of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.
David is a sociologist by training. The basis of his column today may be his realization that their cause in the Opposition is a lost one considering how they have thrown everything at Duterte and still managed to get nowhere in their bid to turn public opinion against him. It has been a week since his predecessor former President Noynoy “PNoy” Aquino passed away and his death has had no quantifiable impact on public opinion despite Opposition efforts to get the people to see him in a better light. Perhaps the people still cannot forget what they went through during his term no matter how much it was made to look like he was one of the better Presidents the country ever had.
The 2022 election is crucial because it is either a validation or a rejection of Duterte’s definition of democracy. Duterte is no Lee Kuan Yew by most measures but he has shown he is capable of making those who need to toe the line, toe the line. There is the direct threat to then Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano who refused to vacate his post to give way to his replacement. There is also the manner in which he gave the oligarchs who control the water distribution concession for the National Capital Region (NCR) no leeway when the water shortage hit in the summer of 2019. Cabinet level officials have been fired by Duterte, very much unlike the PNoy who tolerated bickering and inconsistent direction pursued by different Cabinet members. Just the other day, Duterte issued a veiled threat to Senate President Tito Sotto. Consider me a candidate for Vice-President. That was his way of telling Sotto I can still derail your political plan for 2022.
In a democracy, there is room for a mature and responsible opposition to act as a fiscalizer but not as a stumbling block to nation-building. It is unfortunate that those who have an eye at the Presidency still continue with their brickbats against the administration. This will not win them points with voters. The best strategy is to acknowledge the good which has been done and build on that. It should be an issues-based campaign focusing on public sentiment rather the old mindset of destructive criticism. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the more you hit Duterte the more his base closes ranks to protect him.
Potential candidates shouldn’t pass up on the opportunity to give those who are not in favor of Duterte’s style an intelligent choice in the coming polls by clearly articulating their vision of what an alternative path might look like. This is the essence of democracy. And who knows, if their argument is good enough, they just might win.",Others
35 years of democracy has not freed Filipinos from entrenched oligarchic feudal rule,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/35-years-of-democracy-has-not-freed-filipinos-from-entrenched-oligarchic-feudal-rule/,"Richard Javad Heydarian has a fondness for historical context in relation to present-day situations. In his Inquirer piece “Why do we love dictators?” he laments how, “across the postcolonial world, where the pandemic has been most devastating, it seems many people can’t still shake off their collective fascination with despots, even the most tragically disastrous and visibly incompetent ones.” This is after a showcase over more than the first half of his column of his faculties for unpacking and cherry-picking salient insights off the history of Napoleonic France and stitching these together into a “context” for the above point he makes.
And yet after all that, the basic question remains unanswered; What has democracy achieved for the greater good?
The public always vaccilates between conservative and liberal values — at least in Western countries. This is what the colonial masters have been trying to force down the collective throats of their colonies. I wonder why Javad doesn’t write about Singapore and Lee’s model for city-state building. Many will not admit that China’s bureaucracy was modeled by Deng Xiaoping from Singapore as the two were known to meet clandestinely during the time Deng was implementing his one country, two systems strategy.
China’s growth has been phenomenal considering its turbulent modern-day history transitioning from a feudal system to that of a republic. Peace only came to China after Mao Zedong. It’s experiment with communism as an economic model failed. It retained the political structure but with a civil service patterned after Singapore. It was the British who improved on China’s original civil service bureaucracy which is how the term “mandarins” came about.
Most former British colonies thrived after being granted independence with the bureaucracy in place. The exceptions are those in Africa and the Indian subcontinent which have been wracked by religious zealotry. The Philippines’ dysfunction is both psychological and political. Both are intertwined. The psychological is the lack of national identity. The political is the structure which was never the hallmark of Spain as a colonizer. The Americans didn’t bother changing the political structure because co-opting the ruling class was key in their pacification campaign.
If you think about it carefully, we’re still stuck with plantation-style politics. This time it’s not haciendas but whole provinces ruled by feudal political lords. The skewed version of liberal democracy in the Philippines is simply being allied with the greatest democracy in the world which is the US. Other than that, it’s like the colonizers never left.
The truth is we have been the serfs of the political and business lords since 1945. The elite have colonized the majority. This is where the appeal of President Rodrigo Duterte lies because he’s tapped into this dynamic. Former President Ferdinand Marcos used a different strategy which was to paralyze his oligarch enemies. Duterte is widely-perceived to be keeping them in check. He doesn’t need martial law to get what he wants done. He has the  powers of the Presidency to get what he believes is for the benefit of the greater majority. Think of the renegotiated contracts with the water concessionaires. The oligarchs are fighting back using their media companies to no avail.
The Opposition is not independent enough to stand up for the people even if they are taking monies from their patrons. The South China Sea dispute has laid bare the behind-the-scenes happenings for the public to see. Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario aren’t patriots. They’re paid hacks. The same is true with Javad who clothes his arguments with historical precedents even if they are inapplicable. He is just promoting himself as a public intellectual but his message will not register with the average Filipino. This is what the Opposition and their patrons don’t get. And probably never will.",Others
Looking back: Marawi City may have been sacrificed to allow US military interests to remain in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/looking-back-marawi-city-may-have-been-sacrificed-to-allow-us-military-interests-to-remain-in-the-philippines/,"The tangled web of the Philippine police and military which links the latter to criminal gangs and other lawless elements has long been whispered about specially in the provinces where it’s mostly an open secret. Friends who have close friends whose relatives are officers in the police and military establishments have informally confirmed these links. Officers who are true to their oath and code have been forced into submission in to ensure their rise in the ranks.
The terrorist attack in Marawi City in 2017 appears to have stemmed from a botched rescue attempt for Isnilon Hapilon, the leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), who was reportedly undergoing medical treatment in Marawi from wounds suffered in an Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) offensive in Sulu.  There were also unverified reports that the Marawi incident was a plan to destabilize the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. The President, at the time, had left for Russia on an official visit of high significance because this was only the second time a Philippine President would be visiting Russia. The first had been Ferdinand Marcos. Duterte was seeking to expand Russo-Filipino relations which has been moribund owing to the country’s close ties to the US. The President’s new independent foreign policy is more focused on developing ties with states formerly considered as pariahs by the United States.
The story goes that the ASG was a creation of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), together with its number one agent in the Philippines, the noisy Filipino schooled at the US Military Academy. The agent had advised his US principals that it would be politically impossible for the government to allow the entry of US forces on a more permanent basis as before during the heyday of Clark and Subic. The Philippine Senate would not be in a position to ratify any new treaty because of the rejection of a similar one in 1991.
The strategy adopted was for the US to negotiate with an autonomous Muslim government in Mindanao. It was for this reason that US aid poured into the island in the early 90s under the Growth with Equity in Mindanao program or GEM. This led to the construction of the General Santos Airport at Tambler, which eerily resembles Clark Air Base and the upgrading of Makar Wharf in Sarangani Bay, again eerily similar to Subic Bay. There was also an underlying economic aspect in the strategy. Gold and copper reserves in Tampakan and oil and gas deposits in Liguasan Marsh. The rationale was it is easier to negotiate with an autonomous Muslim entity as opposed to the Philippine Senate composed of 24 unpredictable Senators.
The justification for getting the US back in would be the presence of the Islamic fundamentalists which are offshoots of the secessionist movements under the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Thus was born the ASG. The 9/11 attack on the US justified the establishment of a Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in Zamboanga to help in “suppressing” the ASG. American troops set up shop inside Edwin Andrews Air Force base within the city. The US pushed for the passage of the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD) which effectively gave the Muslims control over their ancestral domain which conveniently included the area where the US had readied infrastructure. This is why then US Ambassador Kristie Kenney had been conducting a charm offensive in both Manila and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the MOA-AD was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. It was back to square one again.
The timeframe for the above events ran through the administrations of Fidel Ramos, Joseph “Erap” Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. It has been speculated that one reason why Estrada was ousted was his policy of all-out war against the secessionists. The AFP was able to retake Camp Abubakar from the MILF only for the Arroyo administration to return to the same when it came into power the restarted peace negotiations with the MILF. The Americans were able to gain a victory with the signing of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement or EDCA. This allowed US troops and equipment to be based on an extended period in Philippine territory but not as permanent as having bases like Clark and Subic where they could store nuclear weapons.
The next chapter was the peace agreement forged by the Noynoy Aquino administration with the support of Malaysia, which had been brokering the talks. The agreement led to the drafting of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) by the Executive itself which would grant the MILF self-rule over the Muslim areas of Mindanao. The law was doomed from the start because certain provisions had been deemed unconstitutional because they included autonomy over what was considered to be part of the national patrimony when to came to natural resources. There were also political provisions which were deemed inimical to the issue of sovereignty as the Bangsamoro could actually declare independence from the Republic.
The BBL never stood a chance as the lower house didn’t even manage to hold a vote at the committee level. Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., led the opposition in the Senate and even came up with an alternative proposition which cured the proposed original legislation of its defects. One only has to look at the proximity of Mindanao to the Strait of Malacca in order to appreciate its strategic importance to the US in the event of a conflict with China. There is more than meets the eye in the Marawi incident based on the above context. It could have been a ploy to force the President Duterte’s hand to declare martial law nationwide or a self-coup if he can convince the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to go along with him. The political opposition can then paint the President as the second coming of Marcos in the hope of scaring the public into submission and get them to switch over to their side again.
Public support for the President persistently remained high and the opposition went on to fail with their plans. What is lamentable is the depths to which vested interests will go to destabilize their own country to oust a legitimately-elected President.",Others
Antonio Carpio’s lies about the South China Sea dispute cause false sense of nationalism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/antonio-carpios-lies-about-the-south-china-sea-dispute-cause-false-sense-of-nationalism/,"A more rational view of the game of chicken being played in the South China Sea is presented by Inquirer columnist and former Supreme Court Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban in his piece “The game of chicken and Scarborough”. Panganiban doesn’t criticize Retired Justice and leader of Opposition bloc 1Sambayan Antonio Carpio but the hints are there, particularly the jab about the United States still not being a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Claiming “freedom of navigation,” the United States (US) regularly dispatches a flotilla of aircraft carriers, warships, submarines, and warplanes to the SCS and ECS. Ignoring China’s self-proclaimed “nine-dash” line, the US conveniently justifies its actions by citing the Arbitral Award we won, though it was neither a party thereto nor a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
This is what Carpio is not telling the public. The US abides by its own rules which enables its rivals to do the same. It can’t always hide under the guise of freedom and democracy. Our location puts us squarely in the middle of any US-China conflict. Such a conflict would force us to take sides as we don’t have our own defense capability.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was neglected post the administration of Ferdinand bMarcos and it is only now that it has been given what it deserves in terms of equipment and compensation. Our defense capability is largely dependent on our fiscal position. We need to be as progressive as our ASEAN neighbors to have funds to purchase aircraft and warships for the country’s defense and the enforcement of territorial sovereignty.
The US has never given the country anything but the mutual defense treaty which is not an ironclad commitment. Talk is cheap. This has been proven during the Scarborough stand-off. The US didn’t even bother to pressure China into honoring the compromise agreement. The average Filipino should realize that what is being advocated by Carpio and his cohorts is a false sense of nationalism because it jeopardizes our interests more than it benefits us as a whole.
It’s good that former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay has finally come clean on what really transpired behind-the-scenes after the Scarborough stand-off. It is now on the record and it is up to Carpio to defend himself and his position, if he can.",Others
Haiyan (Yolanda) comprehensive rehab plan implemented under Duterte after delays due to Aquino admin snub,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/haiyan-yolanda-comprehensive-rehab-plan-implemented-under-duterte-after-delays-due-to-aquino-admin-snub/,"Remember Typhoon Haiyan, a.k.a. Yolanda in 2013? The most powerful supertyphoon to hit the country during the Aquino administration? Much of the blame for the bungled rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts post-Yolanda was borne by Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who was appointed by then President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery. As it turns out, the creation of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (OPARR) was only by virtue of a Memorandum Order. It wasn’t even an Executive Order which would’ve given it more effective authority and power. Memorandum Order No. 62 didn’t even mention a funding source for its operation, much more a location where it would hold office, even if it was attached to the Office of the President.
Yolanda resulted in the deaths of 5,902 Filipinos in Eastern Visayas. This is the official count but the unofficial is higher. It affected, 12,139 barangays, 44 provinces, 591 municipalities and 57 cities in the path of death and destruction it left in its wake. The comprehensive action and rehabilitation plan submitted by Sen. Lacson before he resigned his post on February 15, 2015 was never implemented by President Aquino. It wasn’t even in the national budget until 2017 when it was included in the proposed national budget for 2017 by the new administration. Despite the availability of intelligence funds and the President’s social fund, release of which are at the discretion of the President, Aquino never made any, much to the consternation of Sen. Lacson. In fact, most of the funds of the OPARR were provided for by non-governmental organizations led by USAID, UNDP and JICA Even the printing of the final report was funded by USAID. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been submitted.
The comprehensive report submitted by OPARR became the basis for the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction program which was finally implemented under the current administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Thus, contrary to the widespread belief that it was Lacson who failed at the task, it turns out again that it was Aquino all along. The snail-like pace of the rehabilitation efforts under the watch of then Vice-President Leni Robredo also led to her being dismissed from her post as Housing Czar in November 2016. This was after the President and the Vice-President were the guests of honor at the anniversary of the Yolanda survivors three years after the supertyphoon leveled Tacloban City.",Others
The demise of Spanish culture and urbanidad y civilidad in the Philippines gave rise to today’s IDIOCRACY,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-demise-of-spanish-culture-and-urbanidad-y-civilidad-in-the-philippines-gave-rise-to-todays-idiocracy/,"The use of Spanish words and terms in the vernacular is almost nil at this point with the new generation. Their parents didn’t grow up in households with older relatives from the generation where Español was the lingua franca of society. The mestizos are also disappearing from society. The third generation who managed to squander their family fortunes emigrated to the US, Australia and Madre España. There are no more watering holes where you can find them hanging out, playing poker, drinking or just shooting the breeze with friends like the bar of Casa Armas when Jesus Armas was still alive. Thus there are no more Pinoys who refer to the refrigerator as nevera, the newspaper as periodico, the toothbrush as cepillo, the dining room as the comedor and so on and so forth.
The art of cussing in Spanish is also gone. Puñeta lives on. But that’s about it. No more hijo de la gran puta, joder, jodido and jodida. The Spanish spoken in the Philippines is actually a pidgin form. I first noticed this watching Narcos on Netflix. Our sentence construction and idiomatic expressions are not the same as those in South America. More than likely this is the result of Spain sending over mostly Basques to populate their Asian colonial outpost. The architectural influence is also on the verge of becoming extinct with the demolition of ancestral houses in the capital and the regions. This is such a shame because this is part and parcel of the country’s character.
But it’s not only the language and architecture that is vanishing. The values of urbanidad y civilidad are no longer practiced except for de alta sociedad. Even the cuisine has been bastardized. El Comedor is long gone. Armas is barely surviving because of the pandemic. Alba’s is still open but it is not the same since the death of Don Anastacio Alba who you could see in the kitchen at his main branch at Jupiter in Makati during the 90s. Dulcinea lives on as the fastfood version of the cuisine and pastries. It’s only there that you can have a proper Español breakfast of arroz con chorizo y torta.
Columnist Jose Mari BFU Tirol points out just how ingrained Español is in our society. In his Inquirer piece “Español beyond codes, cuisine, and curse words”, he cites the Revised Penal Code of 1930 and our Civil Code of 1950 which are replete with Spanish jargon still used by legal professionals.
Now why are there Spanish words in our abovementioned laws, both of which are written in English? The answer is simple: The first one is a copy of the old Código Penal of Spain, which the latter revised more than 20 years ago; the second is based on the old Philippine Civil Code, which was an English translation of the Código Civil de España.
But like the Spanish words that have become indigenized, Philippine law and jurisprudence have, for the most part, treated Spanish words as technical terms which may have connotations that differ from their actual meanings. I submit that we should go beyond this, and strive to relearn the Spanish language for academic, practical, and sentimental reasons. After all, even the Philippine Constitution states that Spanish (as well as Arabic) shall be promoted, albeit on a voluntary and optional basis.
Recovering our proficiency in Spanish will provide us with invaluable insights into and appreciation of the literal language, and the nuances and contexts, of major Philippine laws, as well as the legal principles upon which our civil law system is based.
The new generation doesn’t value the old. Manila should’ve been preserved just as the Malaysians did with their colonial capital, Penang. Unfortunately, our leaders have no appreciation for heritage. Manila has been overrun by greedy parian real estate developers and informal settlers. Perhaps the message in Peque Gallaga’s magnum opus, Oro Plata Mata is true. No one was the same after the war. It became all about money and power. This mindset continues to this day and is reflected in the state of society. But I am left with the memories of what once was but will never be again. I have no regrets about being old because I have no intention of being youthful in the present.",Others
Tragedy comes to mind when I remember Noynoy Aquino,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/tragedy-comes-to-mind-when-i-remember-noynoy-aquino/,"If we are to believe the editors and writers of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the late former President Benigno “Noynoy” S. Aquino III was a “great and good leader”. Some of them are also saying he was a man of honor. The entire front page of the publication was full of fluff pieces about Aquino after his death was announced the day before. That comes as no surprise since the broadsheet owes its rise to another Aquino – Noynoy’s mother, the late former President Cory Aquino. The Inquirer quickly jumped from being a tabloid to a “respectable” newspaper after Cory was installed in Malacanang Palace after a coup d’état ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
We all know that the Inquirer is obliged to write favorably about Noynoy. We all know the Inquirer is a partisan publication. We all know they have to take this opportunity – an Aquino dying – and capitalize on it for the 2022 Presidential elections. Members of the Opposition are so desperate to cling to a pattern of succession when an Aquino dies. To quote an Aquino supporter, “when Ninoy Aquino died, the Marcos regime ended. When Cory Aquino died, Arroyo’s nine-year regime ended. Now, PNoy has passed on…. every time an Aquino dies, dictatorship ends.”
This raises the question: Are members of the Opposition actually mourning or are they celebrating the passing of Noynoy? It is almost as if they had long been hoping that another Aquino would die before the 2022 Presidential elections.
No matter how many articles about Noynoy the Inquirer publishes, it won’t erase how some of us have come to know Noynoy during his term in office.  A lot of people know that he was neither great nor good a leader. No, Noynoy wasn’t a man of honor to the families of those who died preventable deaths as a result of his government’s incompetence.
A lot of people have ditched the old saying “do not speak ill of the dead” after news of Noynoy’s death first broke. It was hard not to be reminded of his callousness when he was in power. In fact, the first thing that came to mind after Noynoy’s death was announced was what he said when a reporter asked him if he was going to attend the wake of the slain transgender Jeffrey “Jennifer” Laude in 2014. He said, “In general, I don’t attend wakes of people I don’t know. I’m not comfortable in trying to condole with people who don’t know me.”
That’s not something someone who has empathy would say in front of the media. Granted, the President does not have to attend everyone’s funeral, but he could have been more circumspect in his response. Noynoy’s most famous rebuttal “Buhay ka pa naman, diba?” to a victim of looters in the aftermath of super typhoon Yolanda is forever etched in people’s brains especially since he said it at the height of the disaster – when the corpses of those who died from the tragedy were still lying on the roads. Unfortunately, we came to know that Noynoy did not use filters when he was still in power. It was a sign that he lacked compassion.
Noynoy will be remembered by many for killing the so-called “Aquino legacy”. Because of his dismal, bordering on criminal, performance at the helm for six years, the people decided they have had enough of the lies mainstream media have been spewing about the Aquinos being “heroes”. Even after his death, the people who have woken up to the realization that they were duped for decades by the Aquinos are not apologizing for highlighting Noynoy’s indiscretions during his term. The people are not holding back in reminding Aquino supporters of the preventable tragedies that occurred while he was in office. It is hard to be kind to a man who was insensitive and callous to people outside of his clique. Noynoy was very cruel to the late former Supreme Court Justice Renato Corona who he persecuted even before he was sworn into office in 2010 citing that Corona was former President Gloria Arroyo’s “midnight appointee”.
Noynoy was relentless in his attacks and humiliation of the former magistrate in public particularly during official events. To the general public, Noynoy’s antagonistic behavior was baffling. According to columnist Carmen Pedrosa in a 2018 column, Corona was “Chief Justice when the Supreme Court penned the ‘final’ decision on Hacienda Luisita. To this day despite that ‘final’ decision nothing has been done to implement it. The Corona court’s unanimous, final and executory decision ruled that the 4,916-hectare Hacienda Luisita be distributed among some 6,000 farmer-beneficiaries.”
It is fair to say that Noynoy had an axe to grind against Corona. And that axe was also grinded against former President Arroyo since the Aquinos felt betrayed after she approved the decision to break up the Aquino-Cojuangco clan’s crown jewels. Arroyo was eventually humiliated by Noynoy’s government when she was arrested and detained for almost the entire term of Noynoy’s presidency on trumped up charges. Her cases were eventually dismissed for lack of evidence. But she already spent years in detention for crimes she did not commit.
It is not only the Filipino people who associate Noynoy with the words tragedy and callousness. The people of Hong Kong will remember him as the “smiling president”. No, it wasn’t a smile that could melt one’s heart. It was a smile that broke the hearts of the families of eight Chinese tourists who died in the hands of a disgruntled police officer who held them hostage inside a bus in Manila in 2010. The tragedy happened just a few months into Noynoy’s presidency. Noynoy appeared to smile at a press conference following the incident and refused to apologize for his government’s bungling of the crisis. It was an ominous sign of more tragedies to come.
While the Filipino people were still forgiving back in 2010 and attributed the Manila Hostage Crisis to Noynoy going through a honeymoon period, the people started waking up to the realization that Noynoy was incompetent after the 2013 Haiyan super typhoon tragedy. Not only did Noynoy demonstrate his arrogance as the disaster played out, he also showed that he was insensitive to the plight of the victims. His government was not prepared for the arrival of the typhoon and was defensive about being incapable of handling the rescue operation. Officially, there were over 6,000 fatalities but the unofficial tally was said to be over 10,000. Some of the deaths could have been prevented if only the government’s response was quicker. One could say that deaths during typhoons in the Philippines is unavoidable. But it was Noynoy’s dismissive attitude that made it worse.
I suppose the final nail in the coffin of Noynoy’s Presidency was when 44 members of Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force (SAF) were massacred by Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) fighters in Mamasapano in Maguindanao. This was during a covert operation to arrest Malaysian bomb makers Zulkifli bin Hir, also known as “Marwan” who was in the lair of the Muslim rebel group. It was a tragedy that sealed Noynoy’s so-called “legacy”. He became a lame duck after that.
Noynoy’s biggest mistake was in hiding the truth from the Filipino people – that he bungled the operation because, one, he assigned a suspended police general, PNP Chief Alan Purisima, to lead the entire operation. Because he was doing it so secretly that even then Department of Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas wasn’t informed about it, things went pear-shaped quickly when communication with the military broke down. Then, two, 44 SAF officers were not rescued in time. The public was shocked after videos of the men being slaughtered were circulated on social media. Then the public had to wait for three days before Noynoy made a statement, which did not satisfy the public’s outrage.
The reason why there are people who highlight Noynoy’s shortfalls even at this time is because the Opposition have been known to take advantage of deaths to gain sympathy votes just like they did when Noynoy’s father Ninoy and his mother Cory died. They have put the Aquinos on a pedestal for far too long. Now and in the coming days, they will try so hard to elevate Noynoy to sainthood or a hero just like they did Ninoy and then Cory. That is so wrong on so many levels. They weren’t heroes and they weren’t saints. They were mostly after their own interests, which is mainly to keep Hacienda Luisita.
The remaining members of the Opposition are not looking out for the people’s interests either. Their only real agenda is to get back in power and they will use whatever means — including the death of an ally — to do it. Unfortunately for them, Noynoy did not leave any tangible or lasting legacy. His passing will not work towards putting any remaining Liberal Party member back in power. Besides, it’s too early to use his death in the next election anyway. They can’t even decide who will represent their party. The Opposition have no shame and won’t admit that they cannot win without using emotional blackmail.
The circumstances were different when Cory and Noynoy won after an Aquino died. Mainstream media still had the monopoly in spreading information then. The Opposition have Netizens to deal with now. We will not stop reminding the people of the atrocities they committed in the past. The Opposition do not even possess any moral ascendancy to tell Netizens to stop speaking ill of the dead because they have been speaking ill of Marcos almost 40 years after his death. They also wish for current President Rodrigo Duterte to die as soon as possible.",Others

Death of Noynoy Aquino is NOT end of the line for Yellowtardism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/death-of-noynoy-aquino-is-not-end-of-the-line-for-yellowtardism/,"The late former President Benigno Simeon “Noynoy” Aquino III was the last of the great Aquino-Cojuangco politicians. Because he did not have kids, there is no heir to his legacy just as he was to that of his father Ninoy and mother Cory. Though presenting a low bar for his nephew Bam Aquino to measure up to, the latter Ninoy lookalike does not cut it having been part of the Great Catastrophic Yellowtard wipeout of 2019.
When Noynoy died this week, the Yellow brand did not die with him despite him being the last of the top Liberal Party honchos who wore the Yellow symbol conspicuously. The rest of even his closest party cronies — including Bam — have tried their darndest to scrub the Yellow stain off their personal brands. But Yellow continues to shine through form their camp.
This highlights the irony of it all. The Yellowtards are currently on a rabid campaign to sing ballads about and grab media mileage for Noynoy’s so-called “legacy”. Beyond the coverage of the usual suspects, the family broadsheets Inquirer and PhilSTAR, the family social media “experts” at Rappler, and their chi chi Tweetizen family in those exclusive Katipunan schools, nobody is really in any mood to be in solidarity with shrill 1980s-style grieving. An election year means polticians will be focused on adding to their voter base and not subtracting from it.
Thing with the Yellowtards is that they don’t think. If they did, they’d realise that sitting right under their artificially-pointy noses is Noynoy’s legacy. The Yellow political stain. That is Noynoy and his family’s legacy, and boy does it stick like a rash. Short of using sandpaper to scrub the legacy off themselves, the Yellowtards remain perceived as such — Yellowtards.
So, you see, the Yellowtards don’t really need to work hard to prop up the legacy of the founders of the Philippines’ tradition of necropolitics. History has already done the job for them. Rest in peace, Noynoy.",Others
"Accepting “Racism,” Rejecting Racial Prejudice and the Equalitarian Dogma",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/racism-equalitarian-dogma/,"The part up to “prejudice” is the title of a chapter in Simon Webb’s book The Equalitarian Dogma. I wrote earlier that Webb convinced me to drop the idea that race is a social construct and accept that it has biological basis. However, it does not mean that it should lead to racial prejudice; believing that race exists while believing in genuine equality and fairness is possible. But, believe it, the anti-racism movement actually throws a wrench in the works of improving race relations.
In the book mentioned, Webb uses the dialectic method to discuss this issue (sort of turning the weapon around on its users, the Marxists). He made racial discrimination the thesis and anti-racism the antithesis. And his synthesis is the title above. But what’s the basis for this? Let’s summarize The Equalitarian Dogma book first.
Racism and Anti-Racism in a Nutshell
Racial discrimination has probably been around since the start of civilization. As for racial discrimination in the modern age, Webb says that it is mainly the product of the Age of Colonization, when many western colonizers enslaved some black African people. But even before this, African tribes and Arabs had been enslaving black Africans for years. The new colonizers only took advantage of this when they arrived. It is a lie to say that white colonizers invented slavery.
When some people questioned the enslavement of black people, slavers first came up with religious reasons to justify it, such as saying non-white people are a subhuman race described in the Bible. However, (surprise surprise) religious authorities rejected this and said that other races (the papal bull mentioned was actually talking about Indians) are quite human and should be given a chance to accept Christ. So out went religious racism.
When the Age of Science started, the slavers turned to scientific racism. Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution came at a convenient time (even though Darwin opposed slavery). They said that biological differences between races exist and some traits render the black race subhuman. Other names of note in this area are Carlton Coon, Charles Kingsley, and Francis Galton. Scientific racism of this time also helped in the development of anti-semitism by Houston Stewart Chamberlain and the Holocaust as perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.
Some would again question slavery, and one line of argument was that racism led to it. Abolition efforts came with the call to drop scientific racism. Among the voices were anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, who said that cultural differences, not racial differences, account for white ascendancy in the world.  But the main message was that we are to be blind to all differences between humans and treat all equally. This was the Equalitarian Dogma. The idea sounds good to many, anyway, even today.
But this came with the attitude that scientific racism has no other purpose than to support discriminatory practices and is to be instantly condemned. Helping this was the controversy of Cyril Burt, who came up with a bogus study on twins to prove that race is biological. When I was searching for scientific studies about race on the Internet, the results often turn up to be similar to Boas’ and Benedict’s thesis, basically saying that biology has no to little bearing on differences between race. However, I suspect that this is all ideologically driven. The tendency seems to be that, if someone even just suggests taking a glance at scientific racism, he is likely to be shut down.
The Synthesis
The book’s synthesis of the racism issue dares to raise again the idea of scientific racism as a valid idea, saying the idea could not just be hammered shut in the coffin. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin would hint to this in his double-speak: he believes that black underachievement is caused by sociological factors; but he also says that children tend to have the same level of intelligence as their parents within the same race and that genes may have influence on intelligence. Webb notes that differences in achievement are still noticed even in recent studies, even when people of different races are put in the same classroom or schools or subjected to the same content. He says that racial prejudice alone may not explain these differences. He also advises that we lift the taboo over discussing race as something real and with biological roots, and continue more studies about it. He mentions the book The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, and the work of Hans Eysenck, David Reich and James Watson.
To support his point, Webb notes some factual racial differences. Some elements of physical development are faster in black people. Black toddlers tend to walk earlier than white ones. Black teens tend to get into puberty earlier than white ones. Black people tend to have a competitive edge in athletics (one of our own contributors noted this too), and this is attributed to higher levels of testosterone. The downside, however, and this is often attributed to higher testosterone as well, is that more black people commit crimes than other races. Puberty happening earlier means earlier tendency to get into premarital sex. As a result, black students show the least academic aptitude among races. Also, black people have a higher tendency to develop schizophrenia and prostate cancer.
At this point, it becomes more of my opinion. How do we apply “accepting racism, rejecting racial prejudice?” First, look again at the Catholic church as mentioned above. It was able to say that humans of any race should be treated with equal dignity without resorting to any ideology. It is a matter of common sense values. Let’s judge people based not on their intelligence or appearance but on how we perceive their character, as Martin Luther King said.
So we notice that black people fall behind in intelligence and other things. Whether genetic or not in origin, there is a problem to solve. But to solve them, we need to look at the differences. Ignorance of differences may cause us to miss the very factors that will help us help them more effectively.
Here are some suggestions. Since black people tend to be more athletic, providing them some particular athletics programs may help. If black teens tend to get into puberty earlier than white ones or tend to more easily give in to violence, they can be given earlier guidance and counseling on the issue. If they are seen lagging behind in academics, specific help can be provided to them. The idea is that you are looking at a person’s needs and providing the specific things needed without seeing these as “special treatment” but as appropriate measures. If they get locked out of programs since other races do better, perhaps some programs could add slots to increase chances (maybe add teachers to deal with it), or refer them to a school with the same programs but they can more easily qualify for. There are many solutions that could be developed.
Back to Webb, he suggests “Hybrid Vigour,” which is crossbreeding. I take it to mean he encourages interracial mating (and marriage). Perhaps this will allow the good genes from one race to cross over with the other one, with the hope of improving the quality of life of the later generation. This is based on Webb’s own research on the history of prehistoric people, where he says that Homo Sapiens, after a failed attempt to migrate out of Africa, mated with Neanderthals and Denisovans. As a result, the second attempt to migrate was more successful, implying that interbreeding improved the intelligence of the later generation. Based on this, Webb also says that all of humanity are mongrels, since interbreeding had already occurred at some point in prehistory.
Problems with Anti-Racism
Webb says the anti-racist side throws a wrench in the works of race relations by using deceit to make it look like they are upholding black rights. I mentioned in my previous article the rewriting of history saying black people invented the light bulb and other things. There is also the claim that a member of the British Royal Family several centuries ago mated with a black person, so using the one-drop rule, the Royal Family should be considered black. Of course, nothing exists to substantiate these. There was also that “Cheddar Man” issue, where the prehistoric fossil of a man found in Somerset was claimed to be that of a black man, but this was all speculation with no scientific evidence to prove it. I also mentioned the 1619 Project, the attempt to rewrite history from the black perspective, which is sure to be filled with fabrications.
Another example of the wrong approach cited by Webb is that of some universities setting admissions quotas. The observation was made that Asians are the most likely to top university admissions and black people, because of their tendency to rate the lowest, tend to get locked out of admissions slots. So the solution was to set quotas; limit the number of Asian students and set a minimum quota of black students. But this is clearly racism, because you are trying to lock out one race in favor of the other.
A driving force behind all these is Critical Race Theory. Introduced as an academic concept, CRT is actually more of an ideological movement. CRT claims that the foundation of modern society is racism by whites. All of western society, from the nuclear family to government, is soiled by white racism, so everything must be uprooted and changed. So there’s no doubt about it: they want to overthrow western society. But they can’t be in the open about it, so CRT purveyors just say that they’re for a “just cause” and use gaslighting and bullying on any perceived opponents. Any attempt to point out that racism does not exist in a certain case will be tagged as white supremacist itself, thereby self-protecting against any dissent. Even when disconnected from its Marxist roots, CRT is full of leaps of logic and will not cure racial prejudice but will further incite it.
I am not saying that there is no more racial discrimination these days. But the Equalitarian Dogma and anti-racism are the wrong approaches. They are questionable ideologies that try to force equality or equal outcomes for all. It’s better to focus on equal opportunity while applying common sensibility to help and pull each other up.
Get Real Philippines has always held that culture is at the heart of many problems in the Philippines. Even Webb acknowledges that culture has a role in the racism issue. I have said that racial discrimination more a product of culture. If you want to remove it, it is best done by looking at the culture that led to it and making changes there. Quoting David Landes’ The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, ‘If we learn anything from the history of economic development it is that culture makes all the difference.’
I wrote on this risky topic not only because I found a lot of truth in Webb’s book, but because it was relevant to current issues. CRT and related things might brew up a storm that will make Covid look tame. This teaches us to be careful of the ideas we encounter. Some ideas seem innocuous, sometimes claiming to be the ultimate force of good, but they are ultimately harmful for society. They take advantage of our lapses in logic: for example, how can you actually help reduce racism if you are trying to dig up the “secret” racism? That actually brings more attention to it and increases the likelihood of conflict.
Also, the mentality behind “accepting racism, rejecting racial prejudice” is not locked in by the ideas of others. If someone gives you an ideology and expects you to follow it to the letter, best resist. I believe we all have the right to take apart the ideas and pick out what we agree and disagree with. Each individual has the right to decide for themselves what they want to believe.",Others
The 1986 revolution: an overselling cover-up of endemic failures,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/the-1986-revolution-an-overselling-cover-up-of-endemic-failures/,"The movie Maid in Malacanang featured the perspective of the Marcos family on what transpired during the three fateful days that led to then-President Ferdinand Marcos leaving the Philippines. It is definitely a bestseller, raking in hundreds of millions in sales as the movie was being shown in cinemas worldwide. With another Marcos leading the country as the head of the Philippine government, the electorate has basically highlighted just how hapless the 1986 people power revolution really was. From this viewpoint, let’s analyze what made the 1986 revolution an overselling cover-up of political, economic, and social failures in the Philippines.
The usual narrative as to what led to the EDSA people power revolution is the assassination of then-Senator Benigno Aquino in Manila International Airport on August 21, 1983. However, pointing the death of a single man as the last straw that broke the camel’s back is too simplistic. There are economic and political reasons that led to the 1986 revolution. For the economic causes, the first domino piece to fall was the 1979 oil crisis, where the Iranian revolution toppled the leadership of the Persian Shah. Paired with Saddam Hussein’s invasion of the rich Iranian oil fields near the borders of Iraq, it created political uncertainty in the volatile Middle East which led to increased prices of hydrocarbon products. This led to inflation in the United States compelling then-US Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker to aggressively hike interest rates. This action further devalued the Philippine peso and with a greatly depreciating currency, the Central Bank of the Philippines issued these “Jobo bills” to confront this economic malaise. The debt-driven economic growth of the Philippines in the 1970’s put a heavy debt servicing burden on the government as the peso weakened versus the US dollar.
With economic indicators in the early 1980’s working against the Marcos administration, his political support from the various sectors of the society gradually waned. Oligarchic families belonging to the landed gentry were slowly distancing themselves from the president, while militant groups were emboldened and ramped up their recruitment of new members. The political situation became more precarious and unpredictable as state powers turned fraught with Philippine societal sectors colluding to shanghai the government. Aside from these leftist groups spearheaded by the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Marcos-aligned cronies who turned away from the Marcos administration, the Catholic church called on its followers to mount civil disobedience campaign. Marcos-era technocrats also left the sinking ship, and the president’s most influential allies in the military, who were Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile and Philippine Constabulary General Fidel Ramos, publicly withdrew their support. This tumultuous political environment later forced then-US President Ronald Reagan to pull the plug, as what Henry Kissinger has written in his book, Diplomacy.
The bloodless 1986 revolution ended relatively peaceful with the Marcos family deciding to quietly retreat, leaving Malacanang and, later, the Philippines for Hawaii. The EDSA revolution was highly publicized internationally, as it was sold as a trendsetter in overthrowing authoritarian regimes. These individuals who say so enumerate the revolutionary experiences of various European countries in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, glorifying the 1986 revolution as the first domino to fall in countering autocratic governments and its accompanying successes. But, is there something to celebrate about the aforementioned revolution in the Philippines in the first place? Or was it just a celebration created to feed and inflate the egos of Filipinos?
Let’s take a look on what has transpired first in Poland. Right after the downfall of the German Third Reich, Poland was reformed after being sliced into half by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in accordance to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. As a Soviet satellite state, Poland was administered by a USSR-aligned political party where communist policies were followed. However, a trade union named “Solidarity” challenged the Polish state through civil resistance and social movement. Despite the government’s attempt to suppress this movement, public support from the Vatican through Pope Saint John Paul II and the United States eventually pushed for democratic elections, which elevated Solidarity’s leader, Lech Walesa to the presidency. Nevertheless, structural reform in the Polish political economy followed, pushing the country down a continuous economic growth path. Warsaw became one of the European Union’s engine of prosperity and productivity, as it has continuously recorded higher GDP per capita numbers in comparison to the previous years. Observing these inclusive institutions in Poland, it can be said that Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement was a resounding success.
For Czechoslovakia, its popular civil disobedience movement was called the Velvet Revolution, which witnessed the collapse of communist leadership in a relatively peaceful manner. However, it had a grim past through the Prague Spring, where initial attempts to reform Czechoslovakia were suppressed through militaristic means when then-USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev pursued the Brezhnev doctrine, where Warsaw Pact countries were allowed to intervene militarily in the affairs of their own fellow Warsaw Pact nation-states. With the Velvet Revolution, Vaclav Havel became the president and later allowed the peaceful separation of Czechia and Slovakia in 1992. Presently, both Prague and Bratislava are popular tourist destinations in Central Europe and have adopted free market reforms that made them more competitive. Their integration to the EU and to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as member-states show how Czechoslovakia had transformed into mature and formidable countries in Czechia and Slovakia. Needless to say, the Velvet Revolution of 1989 created victors as these nation-states enjoy political plurality that was recklessly managed during the Prague Spring.
Finally with Romania, its autocratic government came to an end when great masses of the people confronted the Ceausescus and subjected them to a military tribunal after which they were executed. Similar with other Warsaw Pact-aligned countries after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, various reforms were performed, albeit achieving mixed results. Even though Bucharest eventually became a member of the EU and the NATO, it didn’t curb their citizens’ desires to leave their country in search for greener pastures. That’s why there are still numerous Romanian migrant workers employed in the service sector of the economies of the United Kingdom and Germany. Despite its attempts to democratize and liberalize, corruption issues in Romania are also running rampant and child poverty is still a major social issue. These dilemmas being experienced by Romania seems eerily similar to that of the Philippines.
All these European countries, as what Charles Tilly in his book Coercion, Capital, and European States, developed through a continuous process of accumulating and concentrating the means of coercion. These countries have undoubtedly experienced the errors of massive power centralization and attempted to correct them beyond those revolutions through economic and political reforms. Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia leapfrogged, while Romania seems to lag, as their economy is still dependent on foreign remittances just like the Philippines. Waging revolutions is only the means for the society to mobilize, not the ends. Revolutions are worthless, unless it succeeds at creating the necessary state and societal institutions. With such, did the 1986 revolution produce inclusive institutions, or did it just end up staging power struggles between politicians and various interest groups?",Others
"After “Achievement War,” Yellows fail to Prove that their Admin was “clean”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/achievement-war-yellows/,"The way the Duterte-Aquino “Achievement War” rolled a while back demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of political discourse in the country. Although I would hammer the Aquino side more, I maintain the point I made in my earlier article “Positive should never be used to cover the Negative Up” that achievements by politicians are not a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Both sides are throwing out achievement lists to try and show that their president is better. If you ask me, I’d trust Ben Kritz’s article that compares the two sides based on quality over quantity, giving the Duterte side a little advantage. But for me, no matter the achievements, corruption or any huge mistake will soil any record. Political leaders should be punished accordingly for those, or at least should not be heaped with high praises.
But here’s why I would hammer the Aquino side more: the Yellow side is more cultic. In my article on GRPSupport, BS Aquino Fandom reflects Starstruck Ignoramusness and Wokeness, I showed how the blindness of Aquino supporters continues to this day. They continue to insist that BS Aquino is an unblemished, faultless saint, even if so many lucid moments of callousness and in-your-face disrespect of others were recorded.
Opposition keeps harping on Duterte, or even Arroyo and other presidents, as evil (it’s obvious that they consider anyone not on their side as evil). On Duterte, they keep parroting the kwentong barbero (barber shop gossip) that he maintains a secret hit squad from his days as mayor, never mind that this cannot be tried in court without any proof (Let me also reemphasize that Aquino himself likely had his own private goon squad and may have ordered hits, as I mentioned in my GRPSupport article). Just that contrast, the Aquino fandom insists, justifies preferring Aquino over any other to the point of worshipping him.
I think Aquino worship is already the sign of a mental disorder, since people are willingly blinding their eyes to obvious signs. You may call Duterte worship like it, but I think Duterte was different in that he never pretended to be the good guy. The Aquino side was the devil who takes the guise of an angel.
But as I said, the problem with Filipinos is how they treat leaders as silver bullets. They think, choose the right leader for the job, the “born leader,” or the clean, faultless leader. The truth is, no such person exists. There is no such thing as a naturally “good person.” All people are on equal footing and do either good or bad at different times. And, as I said in an earlier article of mine, I more believe that the role of leaders, especially national ones, is perhaps overrated and that things move forward despite more than because of them. People should lead themselves.
It’s a given that any administration should come up with infrastructure and achievements. Praise is best kept to a minimum for anyone. It’s the foul-ups that are something to measure and to harp on, especially those of the ever-holy, uninsultable Yellow Saint.
I still think the Yellow Cult still wants to do the dumb thing called overthrowing government so that they could take over and maximize their gains. They should be denied that.
The Yellow Cult also believes in the baloney saying, “when you are neutral, you are actually siding with the oppressor.” I believe neutrality is a legitimate thing, and painting one side as “evil” is just a publicity ploy. There are no good or evil sides in politics, only vested self-interests vying with each other. The recent spat between Florin Hilbay and Antonio Carpio seems to prove this.
The said spat also seems to be a leftover of the Balay vs. Samar days of Aquino’s term. I wonder what other things would come up related to this. It would be interesting to see if this fully exposes the “good guys” as vested interests and bursts the Yellow Bubble for good.
I wonder if it is finally making some Yellow supporters ask themselves how could two anti-Duterte people quarrel. “How could they not put up a united front? They’re the good guys right? But wait… are they actually vested interests working for selfish gain?”

Antonio Trillanes: History catches up with a rabid Yellowtard attack dog,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/antonio-trillanes-history-catches-up-with-a-rabid-yellowtard-attack-dog/,"The runup to the May 2022 elections has begun with political realignments taking place at a slower pace compared to the last cycle. This can be attributed to the preoccupation with coping with the pandemic and the fact that there is a vacuum in the political landscape due to a dearth of qualified candidates.
It doesn’t augur well for a country when the first to declare their candidacies is a pair of septuagenarians. This is not disparaging their competence and qualification but more about the question of their capability to come up with an equally disruptive platform of goverment to cope with the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic. Technology provides the solutions to the challenges so it’s hard to think of how they can come up with innovative and out-of-the-box solutions when they’re barely tech-literate?
The incestuous nature of political dynasties also comes into play. Both houses of Congress are bereft of talent who have the potential to work their way up the leadership ladder with an eye on winning the top spot in future Presidential contests.
The Senate is the best or the worst example, depending on how you you look at; Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid are the most senior Senators. Neither one is even hardly qualified, much less capable, of being Majority Leader or Senate President. They’re more silent than outspoken which qualifies them to be the sign language interpreter on televised public hearings if ony they could sign.
The opposition is in the same boat. Much as they wanted to build a coalition against the administration, they failed miserably. 1Sambayan was supposed to be the vehicle to unite leftist-liberal-militants under one roof but this didn’t happen. Their event last June 12 was a miserable failure and with the politicians whom they named have all declined save for Leni Robredo and Antonio Trillanes.
The problem is both have poor chances of winning the two highest posts in the land. Leni Robredo hasn’t been able to gain ground despite being in office for five years as Vice-President. Trillanes is the same because he’s perceived to be a mercenary. Proof of this is how he has taken Robredo to task for her consultations with Sen. Ping Lacson and Sen. Dick Gordon. The outspoken putschist-turned-Senator has publicly rebuked the incumbent Vice-President and titular head of the opposition. This betrays his underlying desire to be the anointed candidate of the opposition despite his being at the bottom rung of the surveys for both Vice-President and Senator.
Trillanes has no one to blame but himself. Despite his unexpected win as Senator in the 2007 midterm election while under detention for leading the Oakwood Mutiny in 2003 against President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo he remained resolved. The masa who were disenfranchised by Erap’s ouster vented their ire on Arroyo by making Trillanes win in the Senate race. He became the youngest Senator elected to the office taking over the distinction previously held by Ninoy Aquino.
Trillanes made all the right moves from that time on until 2007 when he and co-accused Gen. Danilo Lim walked out of their trial at a Makati Regional Trial Court and proceeded to the Manila Peninsula hotel to mount another attempt to oust Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The standoff ended badly as Arroyo ordered the PNP Special Action Force to assault the Peninsula where Trillanes, Lim and soldiers and civilians loyal to them were holed up. The image of Trillanes being led out of the Peninsula by his waist band by Superintendent Geary Barias of the PNP is the first image which comes up whenever Trillanes is googled on the internet.
Trillanes would only regain his freedom after Arroyo stepped down in 2010 and Benigno Aquino III assumed the Presidency. He was later granted amnesty for the coup charges leveled against him and promptly began going after his enemies in and outside of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Several anomalies in the AFP were brought before the Senate Blue Ribbon Comittee. All of these were part of the issues which the Magdalo Group claimed pushed them to mount a coup against the Arroyo goverment. It was an ugly specter to see Trillanes relentlessly questioning his seniors at the Academy and the AFP. It resulted in the suicide of Gen.Angelo Reyes and charges being brought against Gen. Carlos Garcia and Jacinto Ligot, who were both AFP Comptrollers.
Trillanes developed a reputation as an attack dog of Aquino. After the AFP scandal came the impeachment of Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012. Aquino had his way with the House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker Sonny Belmonte. The Senate was a more independent body under then Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile but he had to contend with the cabal of pro-Aquino Senators in the persons of Trillanes, Alan Cayetano, Koko Pimentel and TG Guingona.
After Corona’s ignominious conviction under very dubious circumstances came the demolition job on then Vice-President Jejomar Binay. The Senate inquiry on Binay ran for three years until before the 2016 election. It was a demonstration of naked power which was unprecedented as the Senate became the venue of how due process was not accorded the accused in hearings which were supposedly in aid of legislation but appeared to be more in aid of political persecution.
Binay went on to lose in the 2016 Presidential race. The demolition job on him, the subsequent arrest and charging of incumbent Senators Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla and Juan Ponce Enrile by then Justice Secretary Leila De Lima, were all meant to weaken the opposition in preparation for Mar Roxas’ presidential run in 2016.
After Binay, Trillanes focused on Rodrigo Duterte next. He hounded the presidential candidate for all of the campaign period as he originated the hidden wealth claim against the Davao City Mayor with the monies allegedly deposited at the Bank of the Philippine Islands Julia Vargas branch in the Ortigas CBD. He then produced a negative political advertisement showing children cursing as the effect of Duterte’s penchant for lacing his campaign speeches with expletives during the campaign.
Trillanes didn’t stop even after Duterte became President. He has taken it upon himself to unseat Duterte despite his mounting string of failures the latest of which was the series of the Ang Tunay na Narco-list videos on YouTube before the 2019 midterm election. It was also Trillanes who pushed lawyer Jude Sabio into filing a complaint against the President at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands.
What is ironic now is Trillanes is beginning to turn into a political pariah with his criticism of Robredo for her meeting with Lacson, whom Trillanes has labeled a Duterte-enabler. Trillanes was allies with Sen. Lacson and Honasan against Arroyo. If reports are to be believed, it was Honasan who tapped Trillanes to become the leader of the Magdalo Group along with other offices of the AFP’s special operations units whom Honasan was familiar with having been their instructor at Fort Magsaysay.
At this point, Trillanes has nowhere to go except his Magdalo Group which has evolved into a political organization. However, with Lacson having the support of his seniors at the Academy, the end might well be near for Trillanes if the juniors who form the core of Magdalo defects to Lacson’s Reporma, which was founded by former General, Executive Secretary and Secretary of National Defense, Renato De Villa.
Trillanes had a promising political career if only he played his cards right. His weakness has always been his inability to decline the opportunity of being an attack dog. At this point, even his prospects of winning a Senate seat is bleak. Not only has public support for him waned but he has made too many powerful enemies who would want nothing than to put him down. This is usually the fate of  political attack dogs who have become rabid beyond redemption.",Others
Ret. Justice Antonio Carpio’s response to ex SolGen Florin Hilbay’s statement on South China Sea dispute: LIES!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/ret-justice-antonio-carpios-response-to-ex-solgen-florin-hilbays-statement-on-south-china-sea-dispute-lies/,"Finally, Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio issued what is evidently a rejoinder to former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay’s statement on the arbitration between the Philippines and China over their South China Sea dispute last Saturday. Recall that Hilbay, who answered only to then President Noynoy Aquino, released that statement with the aim to point out “falsehoods and inaccuracies in [Carpio’s] story, and tell the nation a few facts about this interesting case”. Hilbay set a powerful context for his statement in these opening paragraphs…
During my time as Solicitor General of the Republic, I served as “agent” in the arbitration between the Philippines and China. An agent is the sole and formal representative of the State, with full authority to speak for and bind the nation. I was appointed by authority of President Noynoy Aquino. I’m pointing this out from the get-go not to brag about my role but to establish my “skin in the game” — I was the legally accountable officer and my actions as agent were the official acts of government. What is narrated here takes from this background.
On the other hand, Justice Carpio’s formal designation was, as he correctly pointed out, that of an “observer”- he had no direct and formal relationship with Pres. Aquino; was not officially part of the legal team that handled the case; and did not have any authority to speak for or bind the Republic during the arbitration. While his expertise on the matter is a given, as an observer, he had no skin in the game. And yet, he has somehow positioned himself as the voice on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) case, with authority to make accusations and insinuations ex cathedra.
Today in his Inquirer piece “The importance of Itu Aba”, Carpio argues that all would have been be lost had the issue of Itu Aba and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) it is entitled to not been included in the tribunal ruling. Carpio claims that this would have sunk the whole case of the Philippines before the arbitral panel on the basis of China waiving issues over the EEZ under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Under the arbitral ruling, both Itu Aba and Kalayaan were declared to be “rocks” which don’t generate an EEZ.
Informing the tribunal not to rule on Itu Aba [which Hilbay had been planning lead counsel Paul Reichler to do] would have been disastrous. Under the arbitration rules of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), if a party fails to appear, “the arbitral tribunal must satisfy itself not only that it has jurisdiction over the dispute but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law.” This means that the tribunal must ask the questions that the non-appearing party would have asked had it appeared. The most important question that China would have raised had it appeared is the status of Itu Aba—whether or not it is entitled to a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Carpio avoids directly addressing other issues raised by Hilbay except for joint-exploration — a complete fabrication on Hilbay’s part if the government lawyers are to be believed. According to Carpio, Hilbay accused Reichler of “proposing on the sly ‘joint development’ with China”. In response, Reichler pointed out that Hilbay gave “completely counterproductive instruction to refuse to answer the Tribunal’s questions on Itu Aba (which the Tribunal had sent us in writing in advance of the hearings).” Carpio goes on to quote off Reichler’s response; thus…
We explained to him that it would be a grave error, and cost us not only that issue but our credibility in general, to refuse to answer questions put by the Tribunal. He stubbornly held to his position, against the strong advice of all lawyers: Foley Hoag, Oxman, Sands and Boyle. Fortunately, SFA Del Rosario and Justice Carpio took him aside and somehow got him to rescind his instruction. Had we followed that instruction, we would have certainly lost on Itu Aba, and possibly other issues as well. Further, his statement that the lawyers wanted to discuss joint development in our response to the Tribunal’s questions about Itu Aba is a complete fabrication.
The fact that Carpio offers a rejoinder in his column — while former Foreign Affairs Secretary Ramon del Rosario still remains conspicuously silent on the matter — only serves to reinforce Hilbay’s claim. Think of how Russia seized Crimea and maintains control over it up to the present. But the dispositive portion of the award over Reed/Recto Bank states, “The arbitral award concluded that Reed Bank, which is entirely underwater and sits within 200 nautical miles of the Philippines, is part of that country’s continental shelf.”
It may just be that the oligarchs behind Carpio and Del Rosario were hoping for a ruling before the end of the Aquino administration or they were complacent about a Roxas win in 2016. But with Rodrigo Duterte coming out of nowhere to join the Presidential race, their plans were screwed. And so began the anti-China campaign of the Yellows and the Reds against the administration. It’s now up to the public to judge who is really telling the truth and who has been acting to protect the interest of the Filipino people all this time.",Others
"Religion and politics: an alliance of money, influence, and power",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/religion-and-politics-an-alliance-of-money-influence-and-power/,"If there is one event that sent chilling shockwaves to the whole world in 2022, aside from the Russian special military operations in Ukraine and the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign as the head of state of the United Kingdom, it would definitely be the assassination of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan, a country renowned for its public safety and pacifist image with virtually no recent history of gun-related violence, had witnessed its former head of government shot with an improvised firearm in broad daylight during the campaign trail. The perpetrator was previously a member of the Japanese Self Defense Forces, which is essentially to their Armed Forces because the current constitution inhibits Japan to organize its military. His words demonstrated the unholy alliance between religion and politics behind the curtains. This ended up opening new wounds regarding organized religion, remarkable considering that Japan isn’t even a deeply religious country in comparison to other nations.
The assassin’s primary motive for killing the renowned prime minister stems from the fact that the late leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) supported and received political backing from the Unification Church. This South Korean organized movement is labelled as a religious cult by some Japanese academes due to the organization’s use of unscrupulous methods to influence its members. Members of the Unification Church are compelled to purchase various goods at ridiculous prices to boost their “spiritual sales”. This forced some of its members to sell personal properties and even bankrupted numerous families including that of the perpetrator’s. These sales are remitted to Seoul to further expand the religion overseas. With a massive pool of financial resources gained from crippling Japanese families, politicians went close to the Unification Church for political support in the form of votes during the elections. With these politicians providing political recognition, the religious movement enjoyed blanket protection from having to answer to such controversies.
Aside from the Unification Church, Japan also had a horrendous history with another religious cult, the Aum Shinrikyo. This religious movement was the primary culprit for the 1995 terrorist attack in Tokyo’s subway, which had injured thousands and killed fourteen individuals. Sarin, a lethal nerve agent, was used by the perpetrators. The organization was also implicated in the murder of a lawyer and his family in 1989, as his actions as a religious cult buster was perceived as an existential threat for Aum Shinrikyo. In addition, the Matsumoto sarin attack, which served as a precursor to the 1995 sarin bioterrorism, was also linked to the aforementioned group. In the end, the Japanese government has decided to hang the perpetrators, including their founder, Shoko Asahara.
Religion and politics have a long, intertwined history in various parts of the world. Starting with the predominantly Islamic region of the Middle East, the commercial, scientific, and military successes of the Saracens through the formation of a caliphate eventually led Islam as its primary religion. Fundamental differences between its preachers and believers created a significant rift between its major sects, where Sunni Islam and Shia Islam ended up flexing their muscles in a race to gain influence in the world’s largest powder keg. This can be observed with the Saud family in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confronting the ayatollahs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Geopolitics plays a significant role in the Middle Eastern Cold War, but differences in their understanding and interpretation of the Quran adds fuel to the fire.
Despite its seven decade-long history of state atheism, the Middle East’s northern neighbor has also had its own share of religion being intertwined with national politics, which can be observed even today. Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, actively promoted the profession of atheism to its satellite states in the Warsaw Pact. However, unlike Communism, Eastern Orthodoxy stood the test of time, as more Russians are professing their faith to the Orthodox Church. Even though organized religions in Russia are compelled to declare and pay taxes, the administration of President Vladimir Putin provided tax incentives to the Russian Orthodoxy, which in turn supported his political career.
Russia’s immediate European neighbors are no strangers to religion and politics. Western and Central Europe witnessed the creation of the Holy Roman Empire, which unified European territories who share the Catholic faith. European kings and monarchs lead and govern through this idea of the divine right, which legitimizes the political power held by these monarchies. This gave birth to the excesses of the aristocracy and the clergy. Augustinian friar Martin Luther rejected the practices of the Roman Catholic Church through his Ninety-five Theses, most specially these indulgences that have filled the pockets of priests, bishops, and cardinals. The birth of the Protestant faith eventually led to the Thirty Years’ War in the next century, where it resulted to the formation of the Treaty of Westphalia. This Westphalian system forms the backbone of exclusive territorial sovereignty in international relations. Needless to say, the Thirty Years’ War earmarked the emergence of Protestant Netherlands at the expense of Catholic Spain in the European continent, according to Ray Dalio’s “The Changing World Order”.
As a predominantly Catholic country in Asia Pacific, the Philippines also has a lengthy history with organized religion. During the Spanish colonial period, the geographical distance between Madrid and Manila hampered efficient administration of the colony. This left the Governor-General with no choice but to depend on Spanish priests to act and administer the country on behalf of the state. With discontent brewing in the Philippine society, these Spanish priests were eventually confronted with armed revolts. This confrontation unfortunately placed the blame on secular Filipino priests in the late 1870’s, with the public execution of Gomburza.
Despite the inviolable separation of Church and State stipulated in the 1987 Constitution where there will be no state religion, Filipino politicians continue to associate themselves with various religious entities and groups, most specially during elections. After all, these political candidates direly need these votes to propel themselves to power. Numerous politicians are seen cozying up with these religious movements, as their arms are being raised by their respective founders, where these public endorsements serve as guarantees for their victory. Such has been the brand of Philippine democracy.
Freedom of religion has been a core tenet in liberal democracies and is considered as a fundamental human right, where individuals and communities are given the liberty to practice their respective beliefs. Through religion, virtues and values are taught that would aid in having individuals develop a sound moral compass. This is greatly beneficial to the society as a whole because well-guided citizens serve as the foundation for strong yet inclusive societal institutions to emerge. However, religion should never be allowed to transform into a means to feed the greed of the powerful, the influential, and the wealthy. Unfortunately, nobody knows how to hold these organizations, backers, and associates liable and accountable for these deplorable consequences.",Others
A Philippine parliament holds a better future for Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/09/a-philippine-parliament-holds-a-better-future-for-philippine-politics/,"The recent demise of Queen Elizabeth II has been the headlines of all international news agencies. For more than 7 decades, she has served as the head of state of the United Kingdom and other nation states, which includes Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The second Elizabethan era has witnessed Britain decline in power and influence, as various British colonies eventually declared their independence from London. Her reign has seen various American, British, and Russian heads of government, from Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, to Biden, Truss, and Putin. Due to her unwavering commitment to public service, her immense contributions to the British public were well received, including her capacity as the previous leader of the Commonwealth of Nations. The masses of the people in the UK have long identified themselves with the queen, as long queues of locals and even foreign dignitaries pay their respects to her. In addition, she has also been Britain’s most well-respected diplomat in modern history. With the passing of the longest serving British monarch, the UK is a nation filled with both grief and gratitude.
The British monarchy has also their own share of mishaps and controversies in its long history. Colonialism, imperialism, mercantilism, piracy, and slavery left their strenuous marks in global political economy. Nevertheless, the monarchy has served as Britain’s dignified institution, according to Walter Bagehot’s “The English Constitution”. Another institution was also mentioned by Bagehot mentioned in his book, and it is about the British parliament. This efficient institution, where the executive and legislative powers of the government are merged through 10 Downing Street, confronts and tackles the predicaments of the nation. Such brand of British democracy has been copied and adopted not only by its European neighbors, but also by other countries with great success. This leads us to question what makes the UK parliament an attractive system of government.
A parliament is basically an assembly of representatives from various administrative jurisdictions and sectors of the society. It is chaired by a prime minister or a chancellor, and usually serves as the head of the dominant political party. As the chairperson, such politician is raised to this position through consensus, concessions, and consolidation. In a parliamentary system, the executive powers of the prime minister and his cabinet is merged with the legislative powers of the parliament, since they are also legislators hailing from their respective constituencies. Merging these governmental powers are helpful in creating efficient and effective laws. On the other hand, the parliament itself becomes its own device of checking and balancing the administration through the opposition. The formation of a shadow government by the opposition ensures accountability through debates held in the parliament, as they attempt to contest possible excesses of the current administration.
In the Philippines, the country has been following the American style of government through its presidential system. The president acts as the head of state and as the head of government. With the presidential system, executive powers are bestowed to the president, where the chief executive acts separately with the legislative branch of government. This works well when both the president and the majority of the legislators are politically aligned, but wreaks havoc when they act in completely opposite directions. In turn, this can lead to more political volatility and power abuse. These instances have been observed multiple times in the political histories of both the United States and the Philippines. It becomes worse when these politicians harbor political ambitions in vying for higher positions in the government.
These political gridlocks, which are more commonly observed in presidential-type of government systems, has been detrimental as threats of impeaching the president are being entertained in congress. Even though impeachment trials are afforded by the constitution as a check-and-balance mechanism, such issues can be greatly politicized and sensationalized. With such, politicians are incentivized to engage in leveraging themselves to pursue their personal interests, putting accountability in the backseat. Graft and corruption become the names of the game, as chief executives create and device nefarious machinations that purchase the loyalty of these legislators. In such a system, chances of politicians colluding instead of making themselves accountable greatly increase, as rule of law deteriorates to rule by law. This presidential system of government can also be attributed as one of the reasons why the most politically unstable, economically destitute, and societally chaotic countries are in Africa, South America, and Central America.
If the Philippines wishes to rectify the mistakes of the presidential system, it would entail changing the current charter. However, there are numerous pundits who continue to treat the current 1987 constitution as something that should be completely preserved, as if it was made by infallible human beings. In addition, there are individuals who are hesitant in changing the system of government to a parliamentary-type, due to reasons that are related with the current Philippine society. These would include the presence of an undereducated electorate, incompetent and corrupt lawmakers, and political dynasties. These social dilemmas become points of contention why Philippine politics remains dirty and that the parliamentary system should not be adopted, but these problems are mere by-products of an outdated system vis-à-vis the 1987 constitution.
When the eventual great powers of Britain, Germany, and Japan adopted a parliamentary government, did these nation-states have a significant educated or literate populations from the beginning? Initially, males of age from the landed gentry and mercantile groups were the ones afforded with the right to suffrage, and was later expanded to include laborers, women, and the marginalized. It was primarily due to their continued government investment in the fields of education and science that gradually made their cities highly productive. In addition, most of their lawmakers were initially from aristocratic families, who yielded power and influence in their respective localities. As a burgeoning middle class developed, they openly challenged these elites and eventually joined the political ranks in London, Berlin, and Tokyo. Even though various political families still hold a certain degree of influence in their parliaments, it is a far-cry from the semi-feudalistic political system that can be observed in the Philippines, where their political careers end up becoming their own businesses.
Adopting a parliamentary system in the Philippines will not change the whole archipelago overnight. However, it sets the tone in creating state institutions that responds to the needs of the society. A parliamentary system will compel politicians and their corresponding political parties to shape up. But with the country’s lengthy history with directly electing presidents, a paradigm shift would be greatly needed. With a Philippine parliament, there would be more inclusive political institutions that will eventually create an atmosphere of accountability, competence, and receptiveness to the plights of the Filipino people.",Others
Opposition prefers a Philippine sellout to the US over working with China,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/opposition-prefers-a-philippine-sellout-to-the-us-over-working-with-china/,"Appeasement or rapprochement? How it it exactly that you deal with a regional superpower like China? Among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries, only Vietnam has fought a land and sea conflict against China. But among ASEAN also, Vietnam has the most battle-seasoned military. The Vietnam War ended relatively recently in 1975.
In her Inquirer piece “The costs of appeasement”, columnist Winnie Monsod writes about how a “policy of appeasement” applied by the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippine government’s dealings with China “costs us” an estimated “P193 billion a year” from the “coral reef destruction” and “fish poaching”.
What the Opposition is not telling us is Vietnam had actually built more structures on the features it claims than China. So if Monsod is advocating action against China, the same position should apply to Vietnam. The problem here is, Vietnam is an ASEAN member country. China is ASEAN’s largest trading partner. Should it follow now that ASEAN member countries ought to take a common stand against China?
The problem with our public intellectuals is that that they are so beholden to Western ideology. US and Europe are good. China is bad — because it is an authoritarian dictatorship. It is not as simple as they make it out to be. If this were the case then every weaker country would be able to stand up to a stronger one. Both Spain and the US got away with their hegemonic intent with the Philippines when it was their colony. What did we get out of it?
Monsod and her ilk only see the issue through the lens of their academic disciplines. There is in our academe an ingrained bias for all things Western and this is an attitude that they propagate through their media channels. This is why we never developed a national identity. We identify more as Americans or Spanish than Asians. Look at what happened during the Scarborough standoff and the events which took place before it.
The tension generated by the death of Chinese nationals in the 2010 Luneta hostage-taking incident, for example, could’ve been defused if only then President Noynoy Aquino spoke with Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang and offered compensation. PNoy did not do either. Any businessman will tell you most Chinese are particular about face. Saving face. Appeasement. None of these were taken into account.
In the case of the botched Scarborough Shoal standoff, then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario was in the US conducting negotiations through Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell. Del Rosario was promoting the US interest in the South China Sea because it was also in line with the business agenda of his principal, Manny Pangilinan. This is what led to China’s aggressive posture against the Philippines.
China imposed other sanctions on the Philippines and the Aquino administration wanted to “internationalize” the situation by bringing it to the attention of ASEAN member countries during the regional forum. Result? ASEAN ignored the plight of the Philippines because it was acting as the US mouthpiece. Mareng Winnie now claims the Integrated Development Studies Institute (IDSI) is acting in behalf of China. The fact is, lobbying is a common Western practice. As such, wouldn’t it be within the parameters of what is acceptable in the Western hemisphere which Monsod and her cohorts are so enamored with?
The conduct of diplomacy is to find a peaceful resolution to an issue so there would be no reason to resort to conflict. As it is, tensions are high in the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait as China, the US and Taiwan conduct patrols on a regular basis. The US Navy is deploying more carrier battle groups in the disputed waters. The Pacific Command has been renamed to the Indo-Pacific Command to broaden its area of responsibility to include the Indian Ocean.
The US hasn’t given the Philippines military aid even when it had its bases here. The same applies now. We only receive hand-me-downs which we pay for. The ill-fated C-130 which crashed in Jolo was a refurbished aircraft. It was in the desert boneyard of the US Air Force (USAF) prior to it being serviced and sold to us. The US finds it convenient to support Taiwan despite its one-China policy. This has been a constant source of tension between the two countries because the US sells Taiwan modern military hardware for its defense while its former colony has to be content with whatever it gives as military aid. Its a dog-eat-dog real world in case Mareng Winnie missed it.
The history of our country is replete with sellouts like Aguinaldo, Buencamino, and Paterno. Retired Justice Antonio Carpio and Del Rosario are the modern-day counterparts of these “patriotic” Filipinos. Pseudo-nationalists have sold us out before. The situation today is no different from the past. This why those who don’t bother to read history are condemned to repeat it. Monsod is barking up the wrong tree.",Others
"Philippines ill-equipped to battle two fronts; the South China Sea and the COVID-19 pandemic, must choose sides wisely",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/philippines-ill-equipped-to-battle-two-fronts-the-south-china-sea-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-must-choose-sides-wisely/,"The US quietly pulled out of Afghanistan last week. It was actually more sneaking out as the last Americans pulled out under the cover of darkness as Alex Magno writes in his PhilSTAR piece “Defeat”. The Americans left behind the Afghans who supported their war against the Taliban, which was also their own creation at the time it was the former Soviet Union which invaded that country. The Afghans have again proven their mettle against a superpower. They have now defeated the US and Russia one after the other. So much for the fight against terrorism which was the US battlecry when they justified the war with Iraq and Afghanistan. Magno goes on to write…
Afghanistan has a long history of expelling invaders from the time of Alexander the Great. The rough terrain helped Afghan guerrillas wage long wars against invading armies. Add to this the incomparable brutality Taliban fighters were capable of inflicting on their own people to enforce their will. They routinely execute girls for the crime of attending schools.
There is little doubt the US-sponsored government in Kabul would crumble under intense Taliban pressure. The Islamist movement now controls the larger portion of the country. They have an undiminished will to fight. The same cannot be said of the US-sponsored government.
The US has not won a major war since Vietnam. Worse, it routinely abandoned allies when its convenience so dictated.
Iraq is also in shambles despite the continuing US presence. The US can’t afford a total pullout just yet because of the Iranian threat. The Afghanistan withdrawal serves as a warning to US allies throughout the world; the US always puts its interests first. Its guarantees cannot be taken to the bank. Up front, they’re at best, lip service.
The Opposition continues to criticize Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s foreign policy but as it appears now, the President is more pragmatic. This is why he continues to hold the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) over the US’s head like a Sword of Damocles. Duterte realizes we cannot be on the wrong side if and when a shooting war breaks out between China and the US. The flash point will most likely be Taiwan. China will not back down over Taiwan which it deems to be a renegade province. The US will not back down either because it considers the island as vital in keeping that sea lanes open from the East China Sea into the Pacific Ocean. China has been clamping down in Hong Kong because Xi can’t afford to have renegade provinces making a fool of the central government. The US would like nothing better than for China to become a “democracy.” This is not likely to happen even in the far future. The powers-that-be will fight tooth and nail to preserve the status quo. This is why China has been beefing up not only its defensive capabilities but its offensive as well. We can’t afford to get caught on the wrong side as when we did during  World War II.

On another battle front, the Delta variant has reached the country. It was not a question of if but when. We can’t afford another lockdown because of the economic burden but we are also incapable of handling a surge of this magnitude. Indonesia is now the epicenter of COVID-19. It has already exceeded both Brazil’s and India’s record-highs in daily cases reported.  The quarantine classification for hot spots should revert to enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). The National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+) should revert to general community quarantine (GCQ) with restrictions. Children below 18 years old shouldn’t be allowed out of their residences because Delta is infectious for the younger in the demographic. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) should finally come out with a unified contact-tracing system. We should be testing more. We cannot prevent OFWs from returning but quarantine protocols should be stricter not only for them but for all returning residents. The daily number of cases reported hasn’t gone down below the 3,000 level since March. The government should follow Singapore in assuming the pandemic is endemic if the economy is to maintain a semblance of normalcy.
Again, digitization should be prioritized. The red tape in the construction of mobile broadband towers should be eliminated. The government must compel telcos to construct these towers for improved connectivity which is what is required of digitization. Lawmakers should pass emergency powers for the President in the same manner a bill was passed during the Ramos administration for power plants. Covid is living up to its moniker as the forever virus. We should do what we can for the younger generations NOW.",Others
This year’s EDSA “Revolution” commemoration is gonna be an awkward one,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/this-years-edsa-revolution-commemoration-is-gonna-be-an-awkward-one/,"So February is just around the corner which means the date that the Yellowtards and communists anticipate in the same way normal people anticipate Christmas is fast approaching. The 25th of February is regarded by “historians” as the date when the so-called “revolution” that, we are told, deposed Ferdinand Marcos “altered the course” of Philippine history. According to a 2016 entry in the Official Gazette, the spectacle “showcased to the world the remarkable resolve of the Filipino people” and “heralded an era of peace.”
Now that another Marcos had been elected to the presidency in the biggest majority vote since that “revolution”, one wonders now how Filipinos will regard this event. It is, indeed, quite awkward considering the son of the man painted as “evil” incarnate by this EDSA narrative is now in power and the beneficiaries and propagators of this narrative have been all but disgraced politically. Indeed, in no less than three national elections, the collective Opposition led by the Yellowtards and their communist allies suffered humiliating and catastrophic defeats. In short, the rise of Bongbong Marcos alone did not doom the Yellowtard-Communist Axis. The previous two national elections long before had already delivered the writing on the wall for them.
Even if the Second Marcos Presidency did not materialise, the EDSA “Revolution” had already been long dead in the water. The historical record since 1986 is pretty damning. At a fundamental level, the Philippines remains the same country it was before that “revolution”. There was nothing truly revolutionary about that whole circus in 1986. The same power structures remain entrenched in Philippine politics and business. The same tiny elite clique of families still rule the islands. The same sorts of disasters still kill tens of thousands of Filipinos. And the same armed homicidal terrorists roam the country’s mountains and jungles with impunity. Dependence on the remittances of the country’s vast army of overseas foreign workers is growing. And the economy is propped up more by consumption and asset bubbles (both fuelled by these remittances) than by real industrial capacity.
Worse, the political “debate” remains framed by personalities rather than ideas. Partisan camps remain rabidly loyal to politicians regardless of the political parties they associate themselves with. Indeed, political parties are no more than quaint scams in Philippine politics as none of them represent nor remain consistent with any big principles or ideologies. As a result ideas crucial to development goals often fail to blossom from the concept stage because said ideas rise or fall not on their merit but on the personalities these happen to be associated with.
So now Bongbong Marcos is in power. On top of the fact that the EDSA narrative is obsolete, the fact of a Marcos being in power promises to make commemoration of this event nothing short of a cringe fest. Perhaps it is time Filipinos downgrade this event from its position as the Christmas of the Yellowtards and Commies. Time to evolve. Time to move on. Time to transition to a more intelligent political discourse.",Others
The United States’ humiliating retreat from Afghanistan is a colossal but UNSURPRISING disaster,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/the-united-states-humiliating-retreat-from-afghanistan-is-a-colossal-but-unsurprising-disaster/,"A meme that accompanied a tweet issued by The Conversation accompanying a link to their article “As the Taliban returns, 20 years of progress for women looks set to disappear overnight” goes like this: “The world must not look away as the Taliban sexually enslaves women and girls.” Sad as the prospect of what the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan means to female Afghans, one has to wonder: What is it exactly one can do for them given that the planet’s mightiest nation had just abandoned its most recent colonial adventure?
As the Taliban retakes the country, Afghanistan has again become an extremely dangerous place to be a woman.

The US presence in Afghanistan briefly established an outpost of Western liberal values in a region where the notion of being “moderate” involves being merely tolerant of women’s rights (as defined by Western ideals). But as the authors of the above piece themselves point out, “[with] the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the situation for women and girls vastly improved, although these gains were partial and fragile.” It has been twenty years and the propagation and embedding of Western liberal values in Afghanistan remains a “partial and fragile” enterprise. How long did America need to be there?
If the objective was to create an American Mini Me in Afghanistan, perhaps it might be worth a revisit of how a similar experiment in the Philippines turned out. The Philippines has 75 years of history following the American pullout from the islands in 1946 from which some lessons could be gleaned. Over three fourths of a century, the Philippines had gone from a promising beacon of American values in the Pacific to a sad caricature of The American Way that it is today — a country that is only superficially American in form and anything but in substance and in practice. Coming back to the bigger point, we are talking about a society that adores America. For a project to embed Truth, Justice, and The American Way to fail in a society that loves Uncle Sam is the lesson here.
Therefore, to be fair, it is difficult to disagree with what US President Joe Biden has to say about the Afghanistan issue; that, “an endless American presence in the middle of another country’s civil conflict was not acceptable”. Only Afghans can save themselves. And, closer to home, only Filipinos can too, for that matter. Indeed Filipinos, for their part, do not recognise the 4th of July 1946 as their Independence Day even if that date, as a matter of fact, is the date the United States granted the Philippines its independence. Filipinos prefer to regard the 12th of June 1898 as their “real” independence day. The way Filipinos see it, America governed the Philippines as a conqueror from 1898 to 1946 (interrupted briefly by a short Japanese occupation).
“Patriotic” Filipino historians entertain themselves by imagining how the Philippines could have turned out had America not “invaded” the islands in 1898. Without the American footprint over the first half of 20th Century Philippine history, would Filipinos feel any more accountable for how their country would have turned out? To answer that question, one only need look at how personally accountable today’s Filipinos feel about how they turned out over the 75 years since America left in 1946 — or even how their lot fare today after the “evil” President Ferdinand Marcos was “ousted” in 1986 and “freedom” supposedly “restored”.
Seen from the eyes of the contemporary “thought leaders” of America’s failed Mini Me project in the Pacific, the idea of a regime that would severely restrict the lives — and rights — of women is nothing short of hellish. But then history too offers a reality check to that in the words of Manuel L. Quezon, first President of the Philippine Commonwealth who reiterated a few times, “I would rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos than a government run like heaven by any foreigner.”
Perhaps the world should not look away from the “hell” that is about to unfold in Afghanistan. But should the world intervene? The world’s mightiest nations did and failed. So for now we can only watch in horror and mull over this interesting question: Who, after all, is the ultimate authority on what is heaven and what is hell? History does not offer a clear answer to that question. Neither does America.",Others
Would Ninoy Aquino have shared power with Joma Sison had they succeeded at toppling the Marcos administration?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/would-ninoy-aquino-have-shared-power-with-joma-sison-had-they-succeeded-at-toppling-the-marcos-administration/,"Endings. The national artist for literature asks history’s unasked questions of what if’s in his piece “Conclusive endings When does a writer end a story or a novel?”. F. Sionil Jose writes of the importance of an author knowing when to stop in order for his story to not lose “its power to make the reader think and ponder the emotional and intellectual awakening.”
If Jose Rizal wasn’t executed, would he have led the revolt against Spain? If Andres Bonifacio hadn’t been executed, would he have done the same against Emilio Aguinaldo? Definitely Bonifacio wouldn’t have sold out to the Spaniards in the Pact of Biak-na-Bato if he was the leader of the revolution. What really happened to Ramon Magsaysay? If you think about it, the birth of the Philippine Republic was premature in 1946 because of the destruction wrought by the war. But this is just one factor. The political structure was also flawed because it was under the control of the ruling Ilustrado class which the Americans co-opted in its pacification campaign. It can be said that the Filipino was colonized by the ruling class after 1946. This is why we have fallen behind our regional neighbors in terms of economic progress.
Jose again mentions the ruthlessness of Ninoy Aquino who wouldn’t stop at anything to achieve his Presidential ambition.
Ninoy, who helped negotiate the surrender of Taruc to the government, wanted desperately to be president. He was ruthless and single-minded in this ambition, and he sought allies, whoever they were and wherever he found them – including the Communists and the CIA. How would he have fared as president with this Communist alliance? He who rides the tiger – as the old warring goes – cannot dismount. There are no IFS in history. There are only the iron realities of men acting out their destinies, a people deserving their leaders whom they have placed on pedestals made of sand. I’ve looked at them – our presidents from Aguinaldo to Duterte; all of them were vested with so much power to do away with our most pernicious and crippling sickness – moral poverty.
What if Aquino and Joma Sison were successful in toppling Ferdinand Marcos? How would he have shared power with Sison? What would his CIA handlers have him do with the US military presence in the country? Ninoy has never been the saint he was made out to be as part of the campaign to buttress his image after his “assassination.” The truth is, Ninoy was a more refined political warlord during the 50s and the 60s but he was still a warlord.
What if Mar Roxas won in 2016? Or Jojo Binay? Or even Grace Poe? Where would the country be at this point if any one of them did? Binay was the most qualified before Duterte came into the picture. We definitely wouldn’t have the outcome of the Luneta hostage-taking incident, Yolanda, Mamasapano and the Zamboanga siege as the highlights of his administration. What if Marcos designated Danding Cojuangco and Juan Ponce Enrile as his successors? Would the Philippines be better off today? Both were politically-savvy and had business acumen to boot. If Marcos didn’t call for the snap election, the transfer of power would’ve been smooth and we wouldn’t have Cory Aquino, Fidel Ramos, and Noynoy Aquino as Presidents. But the process can also be cathartic. We had to suffer for thirty years before Duterte came along and disrupted the political landscape.
We find ourselves now in the middle of the worst mass extinction event to threaten mankind with Duterte at the helm and about to step down. Will Filipinos go for continuity or will they opt for a return to the politics of the Yellows? Isn’t it ironic that the Cojuangco’s of Tarlac became rich from the funds supposedly earmarked for the revolution but kept by Doña Ysidra after Luna’s assassination only for it to fund the ascendancy of Ninoy, Cory and Noynoy? The state of Hacienda Luisita today is a silent testimony to how a business built on monies of dubious origin doesn’t prosper long enough for future generations to benefit. Questions. Questions.

American militarism and Filipino naivete creates no pragmatism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/american-militarism-and-filipino-naivete-creates-no-pragmatism/,"Prior to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s state visit to Japan, Filipino netizens reacted with mixed emotions about the approval and expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Supporters of the EDCA and its expansion quickly pointed out that cooperation with the United States in responding against counter-terrorism and natural calamities would be greatly beneficial for the Philippines. On the other hand, pundits point out that this would escalate tensions and raise the stakes in the geopolitical dynamics of the Asia-Pacific, mentioning that American saber-rattling may agitate the People’s Republic of China (PROC) and prompt it to adopt a more aggressive and bellicose stance. What is definitely at play in the Asia-Pacific, and what should the Philippines be cautious about?
The geopolitical realities of the Asia-Pacific during the 1890’s were completely different, with a significantly weakening Spanish control of the Philippines. To its west was French Indochina, and to its south were the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. On its north was an emerging expansionist great power in Japan. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the Philippine archipelago was officially under American occupation. As a way to differentiate Washington from its European colonial powers in London and Paris, the American government adopted a policy called benevolent assimilation, where the United States attempted to create a Philippines in its own image and likeness, most specially in its political systems and institutions.
After the harrowing end of the Second World War, Manila and Washington oversaw the signing of a mutual defense treaty, firmly placing the Philippines within American orbit. This treaty allows the United States to issue a declaration of war towards any aggressor state to the Philippines and vice versa, despite being subject to the approval of their respective Congresses. Paired with the Military Bases Agreement, such commitments proved useful for the United States, where Subic and Clark served as American staging points during the Vietnam War. However, the aforementioned agreement became too unpopular, which resulted in it not being renewed by the Philippine Senate in 1991.
Before 1991 came to an end, a surprising development changed the world order with the Soviet Union’s dissolution. American political scientist Francis Fukuyama mentioned in his book “The End of History and the Last Man” that the humankind will eventually transform and adopt liberal democracy as its government system. This can be true for previously Soviet-aligned or incorporated countries like the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia, but it seems to be the complete opposite when one considers the biggest elephant in the room: China.
China’s transformation began under the tutelage of their paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, who famously said that getting rich is glorious. Economic reforms went underway, where policies connected to “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” were adopted. With reduced government oversight in economic development, creation of special economic zones, and lifting of economic restrictions, the People’s Republic was able to single-handedly lift millions of Chinese out of poverty. These resulted in China dethroning Japan as the largest Asian economy, with a massive 1.4 billion market and a burgeoning export-oriented manufacturing industry to back its tremendous size.
Learning from the failures of the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was relatively conservative in enforcing political reforms. He pushed for less concentration of political power and influence, which was a complete opposite to his predecessor’s personality cult. He adopted a two-term limit for Chinese leaders, giving them a maximum of ten years, which he, himself, has followed. His successors in Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao served for two consecutive terms, until Xi Jinping abolished these limits, where he is currently serving his third, five-year term. Despite the rising authoritarianism of the police state in China, Deng Xiaoping’s foresight and pragmatism can be succinctly summarized with his “Black cat, white cat” proverb.
With a rising China and a stagnating America, confrontation in one way or another is inevitable. American investor Ray Dalio in his book “The Changing World Order” highlighted a number of historical instances when the ruling power was eventually challenged and overtaken by a different nation-state. The first example is when the Dutch emerged victorious in dethroning the Spanish during the 17th century with the Thirty Years’ War. The second example is when the British became too wealthy and powerful for Amsterdam to confront, where through the Napoleonic Wars, London became the most dominant power. The third example is when the Americans extended their influence to many parts of the world, with Britain eventually acquiescing due to its tremendous losses in both World Wars. All these instances have a common denominator in these power transitions, which are unimaginable bloodshed and damages to properties.
Unfortunately, geopolitical realities that continually challenge the status quo never change. For China, accessing the Pacific Ocean lies on the subjugation of the First Island Chain, which includes the territorial waters of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Aside from being the third largest economy, Japan is considered as a nuclear latent country, where it has all the capabilities of developing, mass-producing, and delivering nuclear weapons. Despite its measly population of slightly less than 25 million, Taiwan employs conscription and is a strategically important nation-state, with its virtual monopoly of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Considering these factors, the Philippines is undoubtedly the weakest link. Manila doesn’t have a massive economy, nor does it have nuclear capabilities. Unlike Taiwan, conscription is not employed in the Philippines and has no resources nor material products that can come close to the strategic value of these technologically advanced chips. With these realities, why does the Philippines need to be involved in a possible military conflict that Filipinos have virtually nothing to gain from?
As a regional hegemon, the United States has maximized its chances for survival. Despite this, they are employing a Cold War strategy in confronting China, through “containment” as Washington has aligned the common interests of Tokyo, Taipei, Manila, New Delhi, and Canberra. Undoubtedly, an arms race is brewing in Asia Pacific, raising tensions in these contested territories. Then-US President Dwight Eisenhower’s words warning the whole world about the dangers of the military-industrial complex might seem proverbial as military conflicts raise the demand and sale of American materiel. This can be observed when stocks of American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon becoming highly profitable. To complicate things further, stockholders of these companies are also members of the US Congress. What kind of cards will the Philippines have under its sleeves if the United States seems to be driven by war profiteering?
Deterring aggression from two superpowers will be a herculean task for any middling power like the Philippines, and it entails a meticulous balancing effort. Stationing American military personnel in Philippine territory by renegotiating EDCA would be a no-brainer to avoid alienating China. Implementation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program should also be observed, while continuous investment in procuring advanced military hardware for the armed forces is a must. To sustainably fund this building up of military capabilities and assets, foreign investors must be allowed to freely own and operate businesses in the country through economic liberalization. After all, a strong, robust economy yields a strong, robust republic.",Others
Dear Bongbong Marcos: with vindication comes great responsibility!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/dear-bongbong-marcos-with-vindication-comes-great-responsibility/,"Is EDSA still relevant to Filipinos? I was 20 years old at that time and about to graduate from college. I spent my college years protesting against Marcos after Ninoy Aquino’s death in 1983. I was convinced that then President Ferdinand E. Marcos was evil and the Aquinos were good because of what I read in the papers and what our professors lectured to us about how we needed to get our freedoms back.
But I wasn’t a blindly obedient follower. I was born and raised in San Miguel, Manila so I got to see the comings and goings of Apo Lakay and Madame First Lady Imelda Marcos on J.P. Laurel St. We were also allowed to enter Malacañan Park at the other side of the Pasig River, which was the headquarters of the Presidential Security Command on our bikes. This is where Marcos would play golf with his closest associates such as Herminio Disini and Rudy Cuenca. I saw first-hand how Imelda would leave early in the morning onboard the PNR bus she used as her primary vehicle when she was Metro Manila Governor and not return until late at night. The Greater Manila Area then was kept clean by her army of Metro Aides. She treated the expanded capital as part of her household and kept things in order.
The reforms promised by Cory never came and the minute she reneged on her agreement with Doy Laurel, I realized that she wasn’t going to be what she said she would. The Constitutional Commission brought back the Senate and the House of Representatives along with the gridlock and the political dynasties. It was all downhill from there. EDSA wasn’t a revolution. It was a failed coup attempt by then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM), turned successful through American intervention. The plan was for civil disobedience after Cory Aquino lost the snap election to Marcos. Without the coup attempt, it wasn’t likely that Marcos was going to be ousted but the continuing political instability would take its toll on the economy.
Ironically, the same thing happened with Cory after her falling out with Enrile and the disgruntled Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officers who balked at her release of the top leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Without the support of Tabako and the Americans, Cory would’ve been deposed during the 1989 coup attempt. The opposition claims they fought hard for freedom and democracy but nothing much has changed during their time in power. The situation actually got worse.
After 36 years, we have another Marcos as President. Vindication and redemption for their family, true, but the prospects for the average Filipino still remain uncertain as President Bongbong Marcos is more focused on the validation of the geopolitical powers that be to the point that his independent foreign policy is nothing more than a pivot to the US again. The reform which was put in place by his father, by way of the constitutional convention and the adoption of a new constitution was shelved by EDSA but it doesn’t look like Marcos is keen on structural reforms. He won the election by a majority but doesn’t seem to have the sense of urgency to spend the political capital given him by the people to make drastic changes needed to make the country competitive and progressive.
It remains to be seen how China will react to Marcos’ pivot economically. But in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the Chinese white ships are constantly present, increasing tensions as the gray ships of the US Navy conduct patrols and Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) in the areas claimed by China. It remains to be seen what kind of compensation will be given by the US for access to bases in the country and if their support can be counted on in the event China imposes indirect economic sanctions on the country as it did during the Aquino administration. Filipinos are left without an option in the event there is a change in opinion about Marcos’ foreign policy since the opposition is undoubtedly pro-US.
Filipinos still haven’t learned their lessons about how the Americans only exploit their supposed “allies” in the region. We lost Scarborough Shoal China because we relied on American “support” as they negotiated a deal with China. Marcos Sr. was brought down with US support. This, it appears that Marcos Jr. has taken out an insurance policy to ensure that his term will not be cut short by Uncle Sam. Hopefully, we don’t get caught in the middle of a shooting war between the US and China over Taiwan. We should’ve learned our lessons already from our elders who lived through the time when the Americans left the Philippines under Japanese rule. We can only hope that history doesn’t repeat itself.",Others
Why Anti-Capitalism is Stupid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/why-anti-capitalism-is-stupid/,"Wokes and commies are all about bringing down the capitalist world, or as the Critical Race Theory textbook puts it, the liberal order. This “order” is being badmouthed as the cause of inequality, oppression and suffering in general. Such an idea is stupid, since slavery and oppression have been existing as long as humans have been on earth and is not confined to one specific group or race doing it to another (even black Africans enslaved fellow Africans too). But, coming from this, I’ll discuss why “capitalism” is worth defending and why the rhetoric of “transforming the world” as an anti-capitalist mantra is actually a disguise for destroying it, based on what I’ve learned in recent times.
Capitalism is actually defined as private ownership of the means of production. It is a scenario where different privately owned businesses, big or small, are producing goods without any need for any “authority” to direct them to. People are also free to choose whether to buy or not buy, which is more free than being obliged to spend on it by others. It is a “system” that developed naturally in history. In fact, I would say that what we call “capitalism” today is simply the natural order.
Karl Marx however wants to convince us otherwise. He and his followers today want us to believe that prosperity under capitalism is caused by a certain few who are in control of everything and had decided that it will be so. The world or certain people will be prosperous when they want it, or poor if they want it. This is how some people define capitalism: dominance by “capitalists” or certain evil people (changing the meaning of words is one of the tactics Marxists use; a fictional representation is Newspeak in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four). They will even argue that prosperity is an illusion propped up by the “capitalists.”
However, closer and more reasoned examination will disprove this. The few big businesses perceived to be dominant in many fields are only a part of the society where many private owners, including small ones, contributed to the abundance of goods in the market. The laws of economics, such as the law of supply and demand, are among the driving forces behind prosperity. The big businesses did take advantage of it and went up on the pecking order, but they are not control of the entire environment. This environment, the capitalist environment, enabled many innovations such as Fritz Haber’s nitrogen fertilizer discovery, containerization, refrigeration and others that helped make like easier today. The claim that a central power just ordered all of this is a big lie.
But back to Marx, who says this evil central power that controls capitalism should be destroyed so that it may be replaced by his ilk (he says the lowly proletariat will take over, but he actually means his own equally affluent contemporaries). Marx’s use of socialism could be seen as bait, to lure in people who mistakenly believe that it is “sharing.” Then he will switch to what he really means: the world population will dialectically be cut down to those bearing the “communist mindset.” They will be the true owners of all goods. It is actually like the Gnostic idea of the enlightened, only those who have “gnosis” will rule the world.
This is what anti-capitalism is really all about. It’s a power-grab by those who are fake “oppressed,” “enlightened,” or other identity politics buzzword you can put here. They claim to be or represent the oppressed but they want to oppress. They claim to be for human rights, but they are actually for suppressing the rights of the people they do not agree with. They claim to be materialist and non-religious, but their ideology is actually cultic. They claim to be the experts that other people should follow but what they are promoting is actually bunk.
Marx is twisting words and lying while making one big gaslight of the free world. It’s no wonder Eric Voegelin called him an intellectual swindler. And this big gaslight resulted in millions of innocents killed because a communist bourgeoisie replaced the strawman “capitalist few” and tried to control all aspects of life to bring about their own Utopia.
So we who are defending the free world from this scourge need to be armed with these explanations to counter woke commie hipsters. These likely believe that they can centralize production of game consoles, Starbucks coffee and luxuries so that everyone can have them. But it’s more likely that none of these products would be invented under communism. It’s also more likely that they’ll be enslaved under a “socialist” government that demands free (no pay) labor so that products become “free” (with no assurance that they will be given what they produce). Also, if the commie hipsters take over, do they really know how to run a society efficiently? Even Marx did not clearly define how things will be run once the “bourgeoisie” are deposed.
Let’s look at socialism. I agree it is another thing from communism. Socialism came from people like Charles Fourier and Robert Owen and they didn’t call for people to be killed. Communism on the other hand seeks to implement socialism by killing non-socialists.
One of the misconceptions about socialism is that it is “sharing,” so any act of sharing is socialism. This is yet another deliberate change of the definition. Socialism is actually defined as public ownership of the means of production. I had taken this to mean that all members of a society own the means of production and should be consulted every time a decision is made.
It seems practicable in a small tribe. But how about in a town of 10,000 people or a city of 500,000? Can you consult all of them for a major decision, such as through a plebiscite (“democracy” according to the Socialist mind)? No, having all of the public participate in decision-making is too slow and cumbersome, so a few will tend to be designated “leaders” who will make the decisions for society. So under socialism, these few will decide on how the means of production will be run. Socialism will still have an hierarchy.
A rich private person sharing things with poorer people is not socialism. It is just that, sharing. But some idealists will want socialist governments to compel more fortunate people to redistribute their wealth to the less fortunate. And it is a bad idea. Redistribution was never the solution to poverty. Trying to push for it will definitely run roughshod over people’s rights and cause harm. Supporters will say, the intention is worth it. But, we know the saying about good intentions paving the way to hell.
Socialism and communism will never give us a perfect world. Nothing short of God actually will. Instead, we best defend and preserve the liberal “order” and our condition of all having individual will because these are the tools that help us make life easier. Individual and non-state efforts led to innovations that helped make food and other needs more available (Fritz Haber’s fertilizer as a case in point) and life easier.
In James Lindsay’s video In Defense of the Status Quo, he says “status quo” is a strawman word made by the Anti-Capitalists to make the real world look bad and to convince people into believing the wrong definitions of things. “Capitalists” are preventing the world from changing, according to them. In truth, the real world does undergo change, incremental change where many countries have developed their economies under the free market. Non-radical Civil Rights people have helped cut down racism, abuse and exploitation. This happened under the capitalist environment on the basis of individual rights. However, anti-Capitalists think the changes are too slow or not enough change is happening. They’ll claim that the cause is they’re not in charge. Or that even the non-radical Civil Rights people are part of the ruse to give the appearance of change.
Marxism was a system of lies to attack individual freedom and make the state (after they take over) dictate people’s lives in all respects. Now we assume that the state in Marxism is made up of the people, as in, all the members of society as I mentioned above above. However, that is part of the lie. “People” under Marxism actually means certain people – those who developed “critical consciousness” or believe in Marxist metaphysics. Basically, only those who are Marxists. If one still maintains individual will, having their own opinion and interests, they are not of the people and deserve to be eliminated.
I have spoken of the World Economic Forum and claimed that it is communist. You would say, hey, a bunch of businesses are involved, so it’s capitalism! No, just because businesses are involved doesn’t mean it’s capitalism. Capitalism, based on my explanation above, is just private entities selling and buying. Business and government do not control (as in, compel) any transaction or motion. What they’re doing at the WEF departs from all these. Before I go further, I’ll have to set you up with an idea.
Youtuber TIKHistory said that corporations can be considered states. I initially scoffed at that, but now I understand. Corporations, especially when working with governments, can put out policies or things like “you can’t get this service if you’re not vaccinated or you don’t buy this other product.” That amounts to not only control over resources but also control over people’s behavior. In that sense, they have effectively become states. And since it is state control of the means of production and behavior, it is socialism.
This means that Communism and socialism will always default into an oligarchy. Basically, the lie is, we the “people” (the Marxists, woke, CRT believers) know what’s best for everyone, so we should be in control. Then they make a power grab for the means of production. Remember “you will own nothing and you will be happy?” That’s the WEF’s “stakeholder capitalism” wherein the few businesses will own all that the people need and will try to dictate lives of people (like order them to be happy). It’s like the Lopezes: they own what people need from birth to death. A new feudalism.
And remember, governments are involved with the WEF. They will help the businesses by enacting laws to force people to come under the “services” that the businesses have (another name for it is regulatory capture). Part of this is the social credit system similar to what is implemented in China. If someone “offends” any of the businesses or government officials or anyone close to them, they will shut off this person from the services (cancelling) and risk the person’s death. It might even escalate to the point where anyone helping this shut off person will themselves be shut off or even arrested (and killed). In other words, a murderous dictatorship.
That’s what “stakeholder capitalism” ultimately means: the “stakeholders” are dictators. It seems ironic but that is the ultimate endpoint of Stupid Anti-Capitalism.
That’s also infiltration, Marxism’s modus. Those familiar with Mao Zedong, Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse know that they encouraged infiltration of established systems. It’s not just secretly teaching and recruiting in schools as we know in the Philippines. It’s every institution. In the US, while they openly infiltrated schools and teach their doctrine shamelessly as “Woke,” they also infiltrated government, business and entertainment to entrench their ideology as deeply as possible. They will use these institutions to infect the world with their ideology.
Seizing the means of production was not a way to reverse the oppressed and oppressor. It was a means for a few to seize totalitarian power. The same elite or “less than 1%” pretend to be “fed up” and have the intention of saving the world, but are actually still acting for their self-interests. Marxism lies about wanting a classless society but it actually leads to the worst kind of class oppression. This is something we must resist.

Continued failure of Philippine Opposition to gain public approval rooted in the hypocrisy of its top “thought leaders”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/continued-failure-of-philippine-opposition-to-gain-public-approval-rooted-in-the-hypocrisy-of-its-top-thought-leaders/,"President Rodrigo Duterte’s niece Nuelle Duterte has, for several years now, been used as an Opposition poster girl by the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media organisations because she reportedly tells people she meets in New York (where she works as a “psychiatrist”) that her famous uncle “kills people”. In a recent Facebook post, Nuelle explores the idea that Filipinos are victims of “operant conditioning” which she describes as “a process of changing behavior by rewarding or punishing a subject each time an action is performed until the subject associates the action with pleasure or distress.” She then goes on to assert…
The [Philippines] is being conditioned to accept that corruption is normal, extrajudicial killing is justified, and criticism is akin to rebellion.
There’s something terribly wrong when people are so easily conditioned. That some even choose it over freedom of thought.
I’m of the impression that Nuelle grew up in Davao before she migrated to the US. I’m not privy to her age but I would assume she was still a child in the late 80s to early 90s when Davao City was akin to no man’s land after sunset. It is easy to say that Filipinos are being “conditioned” by Duterte. But this Duterte hasn’t experienced how Davao City was at its worst. She also wasn’t a resident of the National Capital Region (NCR) during the Aquino administration. Extra-judicial killings (EJKs) did not stop after the ascent of Cory to the Presidency. This was the policy because Fidel Ramos was Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief at the time and, subsequently, Defense Secretary. It is no secret that Ramos followed the dictates of the US when it came to counter-insurgency. He was also the head of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and the Integrated National Police (INP) thereafter under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. The Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs) became Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (CAFGUs) under his watch — paramilitary personnel in every barangay as part of the counter-insurgency strategy.
The other Duterte must also be aware of narco-states of which Mexico is the leading example. Cartel violence has seen civilians in the crossfire. In Colombia, at the height of Pablo Escobar’s power, he held an entire country hostage through his vast wealth through murders of government officials and bombings that killed civilians. He even planted a bomb on an airliner. That Nuelle Duterte has become an Opposition icon because of her surname is typical. What makes it offensive is she isn’t even a Filipino citizen. She is not nuanced in what’s happening in the country in the same manner that other Fil-Ams are. Look at Ruben Carranza, a former PCGG commissioner, who turns out to have held US citizenship at the time he was appointed to a government position.
As @benign0 postulates, our problem as a country is not only political but also socio-cultural. We have “journalist-activists” against the administration but in the payroll of the oligarchs. They are a power bloc unto themselves, they would like to think. This is why they have lost credibility. They are mercenaries. The goal of every impoverished Pinoy is to cross over to the other side of the social divide from have-not to have. We have this photo of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao eating with his hands while, on the side of his plate, one could spy gold-plated or even real gold cutlery. His initials “MP” stands for Mamamayan at Panginoon we are told. He believes or his handlers are making him believe, that this is his pathway to the Presidency. Our politicians pander to the poor in every election cycle because they comprise the most number of voters. The poor are agog at the attention paid them for this short span of time. They are used to the routine of their votes being bought during campaign seasons. Any well-meaning politician will start off as an idealist but will eventually be consumed by the system.
This is why I am amazed at the effrontery of leftist-militant bohemians such as the cabal of Inday Espina Varona. She praises Erik Matti’s latest cinematic masterpiece On the Job: The Missing 8 but doesn’t see herself in the role that John Arcilla plays as the mouthpiece of political kingpin Manong Pedring Eusebio played by Dante Rivero. We have seen journalists being the grantees of edifying scholarships such as the UK’s Chevening and Canada’s McLuhan but they’re none the better once they are back home to continue in the practice of being paid hacks. This practice shows no signs of abatement as even the millennials are following in the footsteps of their seniors. Just look at the Rapplerettes of Maria Ressa. They are the future of Philippine journalism. Scary, right?
While the Aquinos Ninoy, Cory, and Noynoy are resting in peace, Marcos continues to be the bogeyman for the Opposition. Marcos’s flogging is worse than what Mussolini or Qaddafi ever got. Marcos’s memory lives on today because the Opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other Duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of Filipinos. They are no better than the frailes who wanted Filipinos to remain ignorant so they can be manipulated at will. This is what ABS-CBN achieved “in the service of the Filipino people worldwide.” I have gone from an idealist in my youth to a pragmatist as a yuppie as we were then called. The fact is there is no single politician in the country who can claim to be as clean as what the opposition claims the members of their ranks are. This has been the case since time immemorial.
The Yellowidiots have never made good on the promises they made while in the process of ousting Marcos in 1986 and they can’t claim the success for it either because credit to that belongs to Juan Ponce Enrile, Gringo Honasan and the US. I’m no Duterte apologist but I can see what he has been able to achieve in his five years in office despite his having to contend with the shrill Opposition. That is a separate achievement in itself. Think of what he could’ve been done if the Opposition cooperated with him for the sake of nation-building. What we have actually seen is the conditioning being done by the opposition on the Filipino people since 1986.
The infrastructure Marcos built bears mute testimony to his achievements. This is also true in the case of the “defeated” Vice-Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who continues to rank higher than the “winning” Vice-Presidential candidate Leni Robredo in surveys for the 2022 election. Contrast this with the Opposition whose members, after thirty years in power, can only boast of naming whatever in honor of Ninoy Aquino and the monuments to him throughout the country — an unofficial “hero” whose fifteen minutes of fame was had at the tarmac of the airport now named after him. Pathetic.",Others
What SCARES the Yellowtards and communists most about Toni Gonzaga’s Bongbong Marcos interview,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/what-scares-the-yellowtards-and-communists-most-about-toni-gonzagas-bongbong-marcos-interview/,"Those who don’t read history, are condemned to repeat it. This is the curse bedeviling the Philippines. Historical revisionism. It wasn’t until Teodoro Agoncillo wrote the History of the Filipino People did we become aware of the betrayals of the leaders of the Philippine Revolution. Emilio Aguinaldo ordering the murder of Andres Bonifacio and Antonio Luna being the most prominent. Next is the sellout to the Spaniards and, later on, the Americans. We do have a warped concept of history because we celebrate Independence Day on June 12 instead of July 4, which is actually incorrect again, because the Americans continued to lord it over their former colony until 1991, which was the only time they actually left.
Our psyche as a people and a country is damaged because we haven’t addressed the root of our dysfunction; we need to come to terms with the reality that we only have a few legitimate heroes and most of them are unrecognized because they were never part of the ruling elite. World War II devastated and destroyed our country. We were caught in the middle of two competing powers in the Asia-Pacific region. History tells us that General Douglas MacArthur’s staff had recommended the Americans take Formosa as the jump-off point to bringing the war to the Japanese. But MacArthur, with his pride and vanity, wanted to fulfill his promise of returning to liberate the Filipinos. And so the country was left reeling after the war because MacArthur was done with the Philippines and his focus was on Japan, which became a de facto American colony. This was why Emperor Hirohito was never made to account for his role during World War II.
The Americans never came up with a Marshall Plan for the Philippines. There was no massive reconstruction effort. It even pared down to the bare minimum the reparations the Japanese had to pay. It still controlled politics and the economy. It wasn’t until Ferdinand Marcos became President twenty years after that the true reconstruction of what was destroyed, began. It was Marcos who had the vision of what the Philippines should be as an independent nation. It was the most prosperous in the region before the war and he wanted that stature back. We could’ve taken the lead but instead, we were left behind by our neighbors once they obtained their independence from their colonial masters.
Today’s “activists” lay all the blame at the feet of Marcos even 56 years after he became President. This week, for example, is marked by the latest outrage fad cooked up by the Opposition involving actress Toni Gonzaga’s interview of Bongbong Marcos on her YouTube channel. The shrill indignation of their thought leaders is articulated by blogger Katrina Stuart-Santiago in her piece “Toni, Bongbong, history and #Halalan2022” where she writes of Gonzaga’s “shameless” work “right on the month of Martial Law commemoration, in utter disregard for the thousands killed, the thousands more who live with its trauma, and the millions plundered by the Marcoses that all of us have suffered for.”
This is about her decision to use her platform for a person who has made a living, has built his wealth, on the back of the Filipino people. This is about using her platform to allow a person to continue to revise history, to change what is true and factual about the Martial Law years and the Marcos dictatorship. This is about her decision to paint a picture of “humanity” out of a dictator, a man under whose leadership the Philippines’ resources and wealth were plundered, under whose tyranny thousands were tortured and killed, under whose cronyism corruption and abuse by oligarchs were condoned.
Think again, Ms Stuart-Santiago — this time beyond the little square that frames the thinking of typical Filipino “activists” such as yourself. Marcos declared martial law not to stay in power but because the Opposition then forced his hand to do so because of the communist insurgency and Muslim secessionists who were organized by Ninoy Aquino against him. Marcos’s original plan to stay in power longer than what was allowed by the 1935 Constitution was to amend it. It is for this reason that he convened the 1971 Constitutional Convention.
The Malolos Congress adopted a parliamentary form of government. Marcos wanted a return to that. The Opposition in control of the legislature had stymied his vision through gridlock which is how Ninoy Aquino made a name for himself when he became a Senator. If Aquino didn’t think of sicced the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) on the government, would Marcos have any reason to declare martial law when he already initiated the process by which the 1935 Constitution could be amended? What would have been the outcome if he wasn’t forced into declaring martial law? He would’ve been able to extend his term definitely. But the country would’ve had a functioning democracy by way of the parliamentary system and there was no way Marcos could’ve prevented the Opposition from running for elective posts.
Marcos learned from experience that the legislature could still pose as a stumbling block which is why he gave the President the power to legislate by executive fiat with a Presidential Decree. Up to today, none of these that he issued have been overturned because they were crafted by the best legal minds he could enlist at that time. The economic performance of the country at that time was hampered by the prevailing geopolitical order. The US economy was suffering from stagflation as result of oil price shocks due to conflict in the Middle East. The US broke the covenant of Bretton-Woods and took the dollar off the gold standard in a bid to revive its economy by establishing the dollar as fiat currency. Developing countries were at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (IMF-WB). The US couldn’t go to war because of the debacle in Vietnam so it resorted to financial hegemony.
One cannot turn a blind eye to the excesses of the Marcos family. But this is what hubris does to any human being. The difference was, despite this hubris, a plan was still in place. Would we be able to host APEC and the ASEAN Summit without the infrastructure Marcos built? Would we have been able to cope with the pandemic without the hospitals Marcos built? Would the national capital region be as congested as it is now if the Metro Manila Development Plan was implemented after Marcos was ousted? Marcos wasn’t all good but he wasn’t all bad either. The question we need to answer is, can we say the same of the post-Marcos administrations when the “good and the righteous” were in power? These “good and righteous” are all agog again because of one interview. Ang OA.
The truth is, we still have corruption in our midst. We still have cronies and oligarchs. We have the large and bumbling bureaucracy. We have free speech and a biased media. We have the culture of mediocrity and asininity cultivated by ABS-CBN. We replaced tehcnocrats in government with unqualified morons. We have entertainers as Senators. This is what we have gained from the “icons of freedom and democracy” that is the Aquino family. We have not been better off since 1986 through 2016. This is why Rodrigo Duterte is President.
What scares the “good and the righteous” the most is the big slap on their collective faces if and when Ferdinand Marcos Jr. becomes President. They are all agitated over one interview because this would be the final confirmation of their failure and the repudiation of the “freedom and democracy” that the Aquino’s have been packaged to represent. This is history passing judgment on Marcos and the Opposition don’t like its verdict.",Others
How to make capitalism work in the Philippines?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/how-to-make-capitalism-work-in-the-philippines/,"If there is one word in the dictionary that has been greatly maligned, vilified, and tormented in world history, it would be capitalism. Various political and economic theories, together with their believers and practitioners have continuously despised capitalism, but haven’t construed anything pragmatic without capitalism’s wealth generating ability. Naysayers misconstrue the reality that in the history of human beings, no economic system has single-handedly lifted hundreds of millions of peoples all over the world out from poverty and economic hardship that doesn’t take capitalism in to account. Capitalism, which transformed and eventually became more inclusive through the years, has always proven itself victorious in disproving those pundits. How did then capitalism come to fruition, and why should Filipinos make it work?
One of the earliest forms of capitalism was the commenda system of the Venetians during the early years of the second millennium. As a burgeoning mercantile city-state in the Italian peninsula, venturing out of the Adriatic Sea through trade was both a profitable and a dangerous undertaking. Maritime trade was profitable because imported goods can be sold at exorbitant prices, but dangers lay ahead. The intolerant Saracens were controlling major cities in the Levant, while the suspicious Byzantines had centuries of experience in mastering and controlling the Mediterranean. This commenda system tied a rich investing merchant to another adventurer, where profits would be split between the two parties. According to Tilly’s book Coercion, Capital, and European States, the commenda helped Venice accumulate and concentrate capital, while renowned economists Acemoglu and Robinson in their book Why Nations Fail quickly pointed out this system as an evidence of Venice’s inclusive economic institutions.
Capitalism later evolved in The Netherlands during the 17th century when the Dutch East India Company was formed, creating the blueprint of what a stock market is. Unlike the Venetian commenda system, risk and profit were distributed more or less equally among the stockholders, incentivizing more individuals to take part in the market of buyers and sellers. As what Tilly has mentioned, capital concentrated and accumulated in major Dutch cities like Rotterdam and Utrecht, with Amsterdam serving as its financial hub. However, the Dutch observed coercive practices to subjugate modern-day Indonesia, where they found means to monopolize markets and global trade. Nevertheless, The Netherlands was generating ridiculous amounts of wealth, which eventually led to the adoption of the Dutch guilder as the world’s reserve currency during their golden age.
Speaking of reserve currencies, the British pound and the American dollar became the currencies of choice in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively. This was primarily due to their economic strength, where they have adopted capitalistic policies and let the free market run its course. They have embraced individualism, where innovation, technological progress, and creative destruction were financially incentivized by the markets. A protectionist stance in global trade was generally frowned upon, and even up to this day, capitalistic policies have governed modern-day societies. Even Communist China, through Deng Xiaoping, was compelled to reform their economic institutions, which resulted to the exponential economic growth of the People’s Republic.
Inclusive economic institutions begin with wealth generation as one of its basic tenets. Even prominent investor Ray Dalio in his book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World mentioned that as an economic system, capitalism has significantly improved the living standards of ordinary men and women, albeit wealth gaps should also be addressed accordingly. With such realities, how can capitalism work in the Philippines? Luckily, British stateswoman Margaret Thatcher in her book Statecraft mentioned five prerequisites, all of which are of utmost importance, that will make capitalism work in any country. These are rule of law, culture of entrepreneurship, private ownership, competition, and limited government intervention. By observing these, the administration of then-Prime Minister Thatcher was able to pull the United Kingdom out from the economic doldrums of the 1970’s and led the transformation of London into the world’s premier financial hub.
Fortunately for the Philippines, entrepreneurial culture is present in the Philippine society, as ordinary Filipinos find ingenious ways to sell their products in the market. In addition, private ownership is allowed in the country, where everyone is free to acquire and purchase properties. However, there is much more to be desired when it comes to the remaining three prerequisites that the Britain’s Iron Lady has enunciated.
First would be the rule of law, where justice would be delivered promptly, thus incentivizing all individuals to abide by the provisions accorded by these written laws. With the powerful and wealthy elites influencing how justice should be arranged instead of being executed, they can afford to simply ignore these laws without thinking about its accompanying repercussions. Second is about competition, where private companies are compelled to outwit and outlast other companies by not engaging in monopolistic and monopsonic practices. Despite having a competition commission, the Philippines has a long history of cronyism, thus further structural changes are required to avoid such collusions between companies and their political backers. Finally, minimal government intervention should also be observed, where the administration must refrain from spreading its capabilities, powers, and resources thinly. With a number of Filipinos possessing a mindset that the government will come to their rescue by resolving their problems, a paradigm shift is needed from the populace if the Philippines is to have a strong, effective state.
If the Philippines is meant to make capitalism work for Filipinos, it would boil down to enlarging the pie through unprecedented economic growth by generating wealth and employment opportunities. With the country’s present financial limitations, greatly lowering the hurdles of doing business in the country is of significant importance. Making the Philippines an attractive destination for foreign direct investments is the low-hanging fruit to expand the economy. Economic protectionism, which has coddled the landed gentry and the oligarchs for numerous decades didn’t generate the desired outcome, thus it must be scrapped. Allowing these entities to be exposed to international competition will compel them to shape-up, lest lose employees and market share. After all, the market regulates itself through the ebbs and flows of supply and demand. Elimination of the 60-40 business ownership stipulations from the current 1987 constitution would definitely assist the present administration in attracting more investments.
Philippine capitalism will only work if systems are in place that incentivizes all members of the economy to take part in the free enterprise. A capitalist system, which rewards hard work and competition, is a trademark of what inclusive economic institutions are ought to be. Nevertheless, this begins by reforming the highly restrictive economic provisions of the 1987 constitution, which has failed to bring employment opportunities to the marginalized sectors of Philippine society.",Others
Economic pitfalls that the Philippines must avoid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/economic-pitfalls-that-the-philippines-must-avoid/,"Over the recent months, the Philippines had been experiencing consistent economic growth despite global uncertainties, which range from supply chain bottlenecks to geopolitical tensions. If it continues along that trajectory, the Philippines is expected to join the upper middle-income tier group during the Marcos Jr. administration, where the country will eventually become a burgeoning USD 500 billion economy in a few years. Even though economic constraints are stipulated in the current 1987 constitution, such economic expectations for the Philippine archipelago is music to the ears of most Filipinos. However, two significant threats to the Philippine economy are still present and must be addressed proactively as Filipinos attempt to attain better standards of living through continuous economic growth.
The first significant threat that should be addressed is the resource curse. This is where resource-rich countries, despite of their natural assets, have the tendency to experience unproductive and uncompetitive economies. Initially, investments are poured into extractive means to obtain these limited resources, which generates wealth as these products are being sold in international markets. In turn, this showers their respective governments with ridiculous amounts of foreign currencies. Temptations to mismanage these financial gains are high, where populist measures that perpetuate politicians’ hold on power are practiced through graft and corruption. When these natural resources catch a hefty price tag in global markets, economic benefits will continue to flood their respective countries, often with fiscal discipline taking the backseat. However, when the prices of these products become volatile or take a hit, economic uncertainty blankets the whole country inviting social unrest and civil disobedience. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Soviet Union have experienced this aforementioned curse in their industries related with mining and hydrocarbons, respectively.
Also named as the Dutch disease, the resource curse was observed in the Netherlands. Hydrocarbon fields were discovered in Dutch territory and were extracted to fuel its and its immediate neighbors’ economic growth. With the turbulent geopolitical tensions of the 1970’s running high in the Middle East, prices of oil reached record heights. Oil-dependent countries ended up rationing gasoline, while oil-producing countries raked in the profits. As Paris and Bonn were hungry for hydrocarbons, the international demand for guilders rose, pushing up the value of the Dutch currency. The appreciation of the guilder was a major disincentive for the Dutch manufacturing sector to export high-value commodities. In turn, the economy of the Netherlands became less productive and less competitive in comparison to its highly developed European counterparts.
With the world transitioning towards a sustainable green economy, international and local investors are eyeing the mineral deposits of the country. Lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel, which are present in the Philippines, are integral elements in the development and production of modern technologies like electric vehicles and energy storage batteries. In the eventuality of the extraction of these minerals, wealth will be generated in the Philippines, opening many employment opportunities. However, wealth created through resource extraction will not last forever, thus the Philippine government must be both pragmatic and prudent in utilizing these economic gains.
The second significant threat that should also be confronted is the middle income trap. This can be commonly observed in South American countries where middle income countries languish in that grouping. It is a region where economies stagnate and economic development often comes to a halt altogether. It is also noteworthy that countries trapped in the middle income classification have a sluggish manufacturing sector. Numerous factors can be attributed to this trap, which includes but is not limited to populist policies, economic protectionism, absence of fiscal discipline, political polarization, and corruption.
In the case of Venezuela, a double whammy of the middle income trap and Dutch disease can be observed. Blessed with beautiful beaches and massive hydrocarbon reserves, Venezuela is a South American country that has been spoiled by foreign currencies. Geographically positioned to take advantage of the expanding capitalistic society of the United States, Venezuela was poised to maximize its geo-economic location. Aside from its tropical climate that attracts wealthy North American tourists, it has tremendous agricultural potential to export coffee and cocoa which are considered as high demand goods in advanced economies of the West. In addition, its proximity to the Panama Canal gives it an advantage in the export of hydrocarbons to the Asia Pacific market. However, instead of maximizing its geo-economic advantages, economic stagnation occurred. Venezuelans and their politicians lived decadent lifestyles, where investments in the manufacturing sector that could have diversified its economy were nearly absent. This was further exacerbated when the Bolivarian government adopted populist-socialist measures that drained the country’s financial resources. Eventually, as the petrodollars were being siphoned away from the Venezuelan coffers, hyperinflation and political turmoil spread like wildfire. With social order being replaced by crime and violence, foreign investors lost confidence in the Venezuelan economy as capital flight left Caracas with very bleak employment prospects.
Learning and avoiding the bitter experiences of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Soviet Union, and Venezuela is a must for middle-income Philippines. This should be further emphasized as Filipinos have the tendency to be envious of decadent lifestyles in numerous occasions. Such can be observed when many Filipinos obsess themselves in rags-to-riches soap operas in the hopes that they themselves can enjoy splurging money by getting married with foreigners, who they treat as their personal wallets. Instead of celebrating hard work and ingenuity, numerous Filipinos easily fall for instant gratification. Nevertheless, there are two notable examples that the Philippines can learn from to avoid these pitfalls.
One good example of a nation that has managed its economy and natural resources superbly is Norway. This sparsely populated Scandinavian country was initially, an economy highly dependent on its fishing industry. With oil exploration in the Norwegian seas, the Norwegians struck gold when oil and gas deposits were confirmed in their exclusive economic zones and territorial waters. However, Oslo didn’t allow itself to be spoilt by hydrocarbon windfalls. They created and institutionalized of a sovereign wealth fund. This Norwegian wealth fund was derived from the financial gains earned from hydrocarbon trade, where it is currently valued at USD 1 trillion, which is roughly double the size of its current GDP. These funds are currently being invested in various sectors of the global economy, diversifying the Norwegian economy as a whole.
Another notable example is Botswana, which initially had a double digit GDP per capita during the 1960’s before it eventually joined the ranks as an upper middle-income country. Its Human Development Index (HDI) is one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and boasts relatively high living standards. Despite being classified as a British protectorate, the Tswana people took advantage of British protection to keep its inclusive political institutions intact. When decolonialization occurred, Botswana was still experiencing abject poverty, but they kept their tribal and political participation highly exclusive eventually allowing diamond mining on their lands. Earnings from the mining industry were later channeled to develop its human capital through education. With a literate, educated, and productive workforce, Botswana is poised to transition its economy from resource extraction to more high-value industries.
What Norway and Botswana have in common are inclusive economic and political institutions which are absent in many South American countries. Paired with a strong state and a strong society, the leaders of Norway and Botswana were able to maneuver their countries out of these economic pitfalls. Instead of adopting South American policies, which many left-leaning analysts in the Philippines are advocating for, avoiding these critical mistakes are of utmost importance, so as to accomplish a more inclusive economic growth for the general Filipino populace.",Others
Critically-acclaimed Imelda Marcos musical ‘Here Lies Love’ to debut on Broadway: Yellowtards threaten VIOLENCE!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/critically-acclaimed-imelda-marcos-musical-here-lies-love-to-debut-on-broadway-yellowtards-threaten-violence/,"The latest outrage fad gripping the shrill community of Martial Law Crybabies that infest the Philippine Opposition is the summer opening of the acclaimed production Here Lies Love, a musical about the life of Imelda Marcos, the former First Lady of the Philippines. The musical was written by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim and premiered off-Broadway in 2013. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its innovative use of immersive staging and its catchy, upbeat music. The musical received several awards and nominations, including an Obie Award for Best New Theater Piece and a Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical. Some critics have commented on the fact that the musical does not delve deeply into the darker aspects of the Marcos regime, such as human rights abuses and corruption, but rather focuses on the more glamorous aspects of Imelda Marcos’s life.
Rave reviews notwithstanding, the Crybabies are aghast. Mrs. Marcos, the widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, has remained a prominent figure in Philippine politics despite all efforts taken by the Opposition to take her down. Despite being widely criticized for her role in her husband’s regime, which was allegedly marked by widespread corruption and human rights abuses, Imelda Marcos has maintained a significant base of support in the Philippines. In recent years, she has been elected to public office on several occasions and continues to be a major political force in the country.
The self-appointed Thought Police of the Opposition are preparing to rumble. One Netizen called on the Filipino diaspora in New York City to “picket the f*ck out of this”, referring to the Broadway opening of the musical on the 20th July this year. Variety reports…
Opening this summer at one of New York’s most prominent venues, the Broadway Theatre, “Here Lies Love,” will be produced in the fully immersive, mostly standing-room format that was an essential element in its world premiere engagement at the Public Theatre 10 years ago, and subsequent productions in London and Seattle.
The hatred is such that threats of violence have erupted and mob mentality is fast emerging from the ranks of the Philippine Taliban as this tweet exhibits…
This is unsurprising behaviour coming from this partisan camp considering the Philippine Opposition counts among them members of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) who have, for decades, waged an armed “revolution” in the Philippines’ hinterlands through its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (NPA). Suppressing artistic expression, after all, is the hallmark of the sorts of tyrannical regimes that were the final ends of such “people’s revolutions” in many unfortunate countries such as the former Soviet Union, China, and North Korea.
Back in 2017, Filipino artist Iza Calzado was victim to the Martial Law Crybaby vitriol that keeps its thumb pressed down on the performing arts after she graced a party dressed as the former First Lady and expressed a wish to “get to play her for a film one day”, adding “What an interesting character study she would be!” The ensuing cancellation campaign mounted by Filipino wokedom against her was relentless prompting Calzado to tweet…
The irony in all this seems to fly above the heads of the foremost “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition. Rather than have their points of view compete in the free market of ideas, their “activists” call for outright censorship. Is this the sort of society Filipinos look forward to in the unlikely scenario where members of this mob somehow claw their way back to political power in the Philippines? Only time will tell.",Others
UP academic Clarita Carlos: convene a team of scholars to SCIENTIFICALLY assess The Marcos Years,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/up-academic-clarita-carlos-convene-a-team-of-scholars-to-scientifically-assess-the-marcos-years/,"This is an excellent proposal by one of the few objective academicians of the University of the Philippines, retired political science professor Clarita Carlos. On a Facebook post, she articulates her idea of convening a team of scholars to mount a “scientific” evaluation of the 21 years that Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines…
Quite troubling that many among us choose only certain segments of the 21 years of Marcos’ administration but  make conclusions for all of the other aspects of his administration…
1.  Note that Marcos ruled the country for 21 years assisted by thousands of us who continue to live to this day;
2.  I, for one, had been a consultant of PM Virata and had been one of the first trainors of the  Career Foreign Service Development Program at DAP, in the early 70s;
3.  If we want a scientific assessment of 21 years of his administration, then, let us compose a team of scholars who will agree on ff:
a.  Methodology for assessment
b.  Relative potencies of variables like agriculture, education, health, foreign policy, etc
c.  Data sources
d.  Data analyses
4.  The results of (3) shall be made public and a series of RTDs to be conducted to give way for any and all challenges to the assessment report.
Trivia:  If some bright minds will again label me as pro Marcos because of my views above, you have two options:
1.  Read my PhD dissertation on FM and RM
2.  Find a deep lake where you can drown yourself
I hope that this initiative flies seeing that even that chi chi educational institution in Katipunan that has become a den of Yellowtardism, the Ateneo, has so far dismally failed to exhibit the same scholarship when it comes to their favourite bogeyman. Indeed, Marcos is not all good but he was not all bad either. Proof? Look at Cory Aquino’s administration! Unfortunately there aren’t many other academics who can be objective in their assessment. Why? It would debunk the narrative which has been spun for Marcos by his detractors. As Winston Churchill said “Study history, study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft.”
The declaration of martial law wasn’t meant to extend Marcos’s term. He already addressed that by amending the Constitution to adopt a parliamentary form of government. With or without martial law, that would’ve been the outcome of the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Martial law was brought about by Ninoy Aquino because he meant to topple Marcos through the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Why? He was obsessed with becoming President and he wouldn’t have the opportunity for as long as Marcos was in office. Ninoy probably thought it was his birthright considering his provenance. Marcos had no provenance to speak of. He only had his brilliant mind. It is for this reason that he was cleared of the murder of Julio Nalundasan even if he was actually complicit. Jose P. Laurel thought it would be a waste of such a man if he was jailed for a crime borne out of political rivalry.
The Yellows and the Reds have been having their cake and eating it too. Why should individuals who have taken up arms against government be regarded as “heroes” as they have been glorified in the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City? Why is Marcos being blamed for the lost youth of the 60s and 70s? Why can’t we move forward from Marcos and martial law? The simplest answer is it’s a convenient excuse for the failures of the Yellows and the Reds so history will not judge them as failures.
It has become evident that they are fuming over the election of Rodrigo Duterte to the Presidency in 2016. This is the will of the people which they refuse to respect as they did with Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 1998. They employed the same with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) after she had a falling out with them. The Yellows and the Reds are going all-out in their vilification of Duterte and Marcos because they realize that it makes perfect sense for both to run and will likely win as a tandem in 2022, this will be the end of them.",Others
Bongbong Marcos banned from travel to the United States and Switzerland: What this means for Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/bongbong-marcos-banned-from-travel-to-the-united-states-and-switzerland-what-this-means-for-filipinos/,"Members of the Opposition Yellowtard bloc are making it look like presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos’s being banned from setting foot on the soil of the Philippines’ former colonial master is a bad thing. It could be because of their recent falling out with the communists and, now as a result, are opposed to the single biggest pillar of the latter’s “activism” — the fantastical idea that every Filipino president is a tuta (lapdog) of the United States.
To remain consistent to their moronic ideology then, the communists should be throwing their support behind the first evah Philippine president who will be leading a government that will, out of necessity, have to operate outside of America’s sphere of influence. A Marcos presidency should therefore be regarded as a gift to Philippine communism. Shortly after President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in 2016, Joma Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), reportedly said in “online interviews” that “[if] deemed necessary by the revolutionary movement, I will return to the Philippines to fight the Duterte puppet regime of US imperialism”. Indeed, communist “activism” has remained consistent to this ululation since time immemorial.
The Philippines has long been the United States’ Mini Me. It is a quaint legacy of American aspirations to create a beacon of democracy in the region to assure a world fearful of the communist onslaught that at least one southeast Asian domino will remain standing as the others (as the thinking at the time went) fell.
Filipinos of a certain generation — particularly that of Sison’s himself — continue to cling to the obsolete notion that their duty as a people lies in upholding that mission to be instrumental to the containment of any threat to America’s hegemony in the region. This is a notion Sison and his communist henchmen have been battling for decades; to the extent of perpetrating terrorist activities in the countryside through its terror arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). Still, beyond the perverse ideology Sison and his ilk espouse, many traditional Filipino politicians have long demonstrated a cockiness that far exceeds their country’s ability to stand on its own two feet both economically and militarily. Recall in the early 1990s how twelve senators duly elected by the popular vote (and as such presumably representing the Filipino people’s “will”) voted to boot the American Military out of Philippine shores…
Thanks to the 12 bozos who voted against US military bases in the Philippines in 1991 — Senate President Jovito Salonga, Sens. Wigberto Tanada, Teofisto Guingona, Rene Saguisag, Victor Ziga, Sotero Laurel, Ernesto Maceda, Agapito Aquino, Juan Ponce Enrile, Joseph Estrada, Orlando Mercado, and Aquilino Pimentel — Filipinos have, right in their faces today, a sad lesson twenty years in the making in what it is like to languish outside the American sphere of what is globally relevant.
Well herein now, by all accounts, is presented a candidate in Marcos Jr. who, whether he himself likes it or not, promises to slam the door on any further “imperialism” the United States presumes to effect on its former “brown brothers” in the Far East. What then of the old Cold War rheroric of the CPP-NPA? The other day, Inquirer columnist Ma. Ceres P. Doyo issued a veiled threat writing that “[a] Marcos win will fuel the armed insurgency. 1980s redux, a déjà vu.” That will be an interesting circus to behold indeed specially the part where these commies engineer further convolution into their propaganda in their continued lame attempts to navigate the landscape of inconsistencies they’ve laid before their “cause”.",Others
"Mistakes, miscalculations, and mismanagement summarize the Liberal Party’s leadership",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/mistakes-miscalculations-and-mismanagement-summarize-liberal-partys-leadership/,"The signing of Imperial Japan’s instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri officially created a deadline for the Philippine commonwealth to transition herself to the third republic. The Nacionalista party, a political party established by Presidents Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmena, was dominating the legislature with their numbers. With President Quezon succumbing to tuberculosis during the second world war, then-Vice President Sergio Osmena took office and enjoyed an initial advantage as the incumbent chief executive in the lead up to the 1946 presidential elections. The first general elections of the third Philippine republic pitted two candidates hailing from the Nacionalista party, President Osmena against Senate President Roxas. With President Osmena placing too much trust on his achievements and name recall, his complacency later paved the way for his own defeat. The political rift generated between those factions inside the Nacionalista party gave birth to the Liberal party of the Philippines, which was founded by then-Senators Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino.
This separation between those two parties can be viewed through their differences in accordance to the political spectrum, which separates conservatives from liberals. Such differences are visible in the mature democracies of the United Kingdom’s parliamentary system and that of the United States’ presidential system. The United Kingdom has the Conservative and Labour parties, while the United States has the Republicans and the Democrats. Even countries that had a long history of authoritarian and militaristic governments such as in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan later adopted such political separation. These differences in their political ideologies provide a glimpse as to how they craft government policies as instruments of administration. Unfortunately, this cannot be said to describe that of the Philippines because of the nation’s weak institutions. Coupled with Filipino-style politicking, it can be easily observed why Philippine politics had always been both demeaning and demoralizing.
Philippine political institutions had never matured and, undeniably, continue to be non-inclusive, which is similar to how the Spaniards denied Filipinos socio-economic freedoms during the colonial period. In turn, these flawed political institutions of the country created two notable disorders: the proliferation of unstable political parties and turncoats. Ideally in a government, the administration creates and executes laws while the opposition performs its duty as a balancing, checking body in the legislature. However, this character-based politics of the country has deeply embedded itself in the society, where political parties are no longer bastions of ideologies and constructive dialogues but mere machinations for elections. Paired with local government candidates who willingly neglect their allegiances and principles for political survival, a volatile yet corrosive social environment is created. This was highlighted when the administration of President Benigno Aquino demonstrated how the Liberal party (LP) and its officials governed the Philippine republic.
Borrowing Voltaire’s cynical remark about the Holy Roman Empire, the same can be said about the Liberal party of the Philippines. The LP is neither liberal, nor a party, nor for the Philippines. First is that the aforementioned party is liberal only in name. They proudly espouse human rights and civil liberties, which are essential in liberalism. However, the LP is merely paying lip-service to such advocacies since they are designed only to suit the interests of the party’s stockholders. Together with a sympathetic media, they have creatively pushed for narratives that appear liberal externally, but remain internally illiberal. Such can be observed since there is a near complete absence of liberalizing reforms in their administration, specially in the Philippine economy. They blocked these critical reforms because they utterly dislike enfranchising groups of individuals that would become potential competitors for power. Protectionism, not liberalization, is the name of LP’s game.
Also, the Liberal party is no political party because aside from the clear absence of binding fundamental ideologies between their members, it is only created as a platform of fielding candidates during elections. LP has taken advantage of popular opinion that distracts from and camouflages their hidden, malicious, and nefarious interests. Their connections with traditional media entities sustain a deadly propaganda machine. Through media, LP can manipulate public opinion easily, where they can vilify one innocent individual with a guilty verdict in the eyes of an ordinary man. Such is the harrowing situation of a hollow political party.
Finally, the Liberal party was never for the Filipinos. Their desire to control and monopolize narratives divides the society with their self-righteous and culpable actions. In addition, the lack of reforms in their policies made the wealthy, wealthier and the poor, poorer. Their lackadaisical governance is an embarrassment to the electorate. How can we expect freedom from the dehumanizing effects of poverty if the LP promotes institutions that are both politically and economically extractive? How can the intergenerational poverty of Filipinos be resolved when the said political party does not craft and submit legislation that promotes the creation of employment opportunities? Serving the interests of the country’s political and economic elites definitely come first, and defending national interests is a far second for the LP.
All of these observations regarding the Liberal party of the Philippines are clear when one contextualizes Benigno Aquino’s presidency and his dismal performance. First is about the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which was deliberately used to purchase the services and political support of various lawmakers. This “pork barrel” had substantially increased during his administration and was distributed under the LP’s discretion. Fortunately, the Supreme Court declared the unconstitutionality of PDAF. Speaking of the highest judicial body, the impeachment trial of the chief magistrate added a hideous blemish to Philippine history as allies of then-President Aquino mocked the check-and-balance system of the 1987 constitution. They engaged in trial-by-publicity, which compelled the senators to impeach Chief Justice Renato Corona, except for the three defiant yet dignified legislators. Lastly, the macabre massacre of the country’s special action forces demonstrated the lack of finesse in decision-making of the chief executive and his stalwarts. LP’s incompetence costed precious lives and guess what they have been saying all along; those incidents were never their fault.
The Aquino administration was pampered with strong and timely fiscal policy reforms that President Gloria Arroyo introduced. It was a matter of stabilizing the country. Instead, however, Aquino resorted to hijacking and cannibalizing these faulty institutions. Dysfunctional mass transport systems, filthy airport schemes, botched relief operations, massive bribery, and lowered morale of the armed forces are mere symptoms of the LP’s brand of governance, which should definitively form no part in the nation-building process. However, here they are again, being rebranded from yellows to pinks as they attempt to wage this moral crusade in reclaiming Malacañang. This can be analogized with how Amb. Rigoberto Tiglao as also articulated in his book entitled Debunked mentioned that PDAF was basically renamed as “Bottom-up budgeting projects”, while maintaining its sinister objectives. Hopefully, the 2022 elections would follow the patterns of 2016 and 2019 when the electorate served the LP humiliating defeats that irrevocably lost them the people’s mandate. If they are to survive, the Liberal party of the Philippines must transform internally and recalibrate themselves first, lest they fall further to the abyss of irrelevance.",Others
The Ukrainian crisis: why Filipinos must be pragmatic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/the-ukrainian-crisis-why-filipinos-must-be-pragmatic/,"The military conflict involving Kiev and Moscow has been making the headlines of various news outlets all over the world. This Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict officially started when current Russian president Vladimir Putin recognized two people’s republics located in Eastern Ukraine, which are Luhansk and Donetsk. Collectively, they are grouped together as the Donbas region, where residents in these areas are said to be sympathetic towards the Russians. Kremlin-backed media emphasize that these incursions involve conducting “special military operations”. On the other hand, western-backed media label these operations as an “invasion”, where Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are being tested. Nevertheless, losses in human lives are mounting, economic damage is exponentially increasing, and political uncertainty in Eurasia is looming.
The effects of the Ukrainian crisis are felt beyond these Slavic nation-states. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are providing various military hardware such as precision-guided missiles, and are also extending different kinds of assistance to elements confronting the Russian armed forces. Liberal democracies are slapping numerous economic sanctions against Russia and Russian oligarchs, where countries that are geographically distant from Eastern Europe like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore have joined the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in denouncing and punishing such aggression. Multinational companies have also suspended their services, further isolating Moscow and restricting access to the international markets. All of these has made Russia the most heavily sanctioned country on the planet.
This brewing conflict entails geopolitical factors related to Ukraine and Russia. First would be Russia’s security concerns as NATO membership expands. Right before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, then-General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and then-President George HW Bush had verbally agreed that NATO will end at Germany’s borders. However, NATO has gradually extended its membership to Warsaw Pact countries, successor countries of Yugoslavia, and even to other Soviet Socialist Republics previously aligned with Kremlin. Extending such membership to Kiev would therefore threaten Moscow, as its own political survival would be questioned once American ballistic missiles are menacingly stationed nearby. Second would be about the Crimean peninsula and the port city of Sevastopol, since it is strategically located in the Black Sea, where Russians can extend their influence to the Mediterranean Sea. Crimea was later annexed in 2014 under the pretext of protecting Russian citizens. With this annexation, Kiev has halted water flow to the peninsula, making Crimea experience drier seasons while putting the welfare of its local residents at risk. Lastly, hydrocarbons have been discovered and can be extracted in three separate regions of Ukraine, which are in Ukraine’s west, east, and in the south imbedded under the Black Sea. Initially, these resources were difficult to extract, but with the advent of hydraulic fracturing or fracking, Kiev can access gas and oil, which it can export to the Europeans. Fearing such economic competition that would lower Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, eliminating potential competitors through predatory military tactics would work in favor of Moscow’s interests by maintaining its market share.
With those factors enumerated, global markets have trembled, adversely affecting both wealthy and poor countries. Knowing that modern-day living is backed by these hydrocarbons and with political volatility inviting economic uncertainty, the prices of crude oil and other petroleum-related commodities continue to skyrocket. In addition, both Ukraine and Russia export billions of dollars worth of wheat, a key food resource. These two situations would definitely generate a cost-push inflation in any economy, harming the most marginalized sectors of the society. Other businesses would attempt to adapt by adopting stealth inflation, where the price stays the same but the product’s gross weight is lessened. Conclusively, consumers’ purchasing power is diminished, leading to a possible deterioration of living standards. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable Filipinos will continue experiencing these economic hardships.
On social media, Filipino netizens strongly denounce Russia’s aggressive military actions, even though it is noticeable that a significant majority of them have virtually no background on the subject matter of Russian affairs. Numerous Filipinos would rather take the moral high ground and create labels. One particularly popular one is of the Russian strongman as reincarnation of the vilified Nazi Germany’s Fuhrer. They come up with these without comprehending the underlying dynamics of European politics. This is a reflection of how the Catholic church’s teachings have penetrated the Filipino psyche, creating more gullible victims of false dichotomies instead of a populace capable of critical thinking.
Taking a look at the Philippine’s colonial history under American administration, the liberal school of thought in international relations had also made its way to the Filipino intelligentsia through Wilsonianism. This can be traced to when then-US President Woodrow Wilson convinced American legislators to join hands with imperialist Britain and France in fighting Wilhelmine Germany, which resulted to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and the establishment of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations. However, the idealist nature of the Wilsonian thought fails to explain these events associated with the Ukrainian crisis, most specially that United Nations (UN) resolutions raised in the security council and the general assembly condemning acts of violence are virtually toothless. It must be viewed in accordance with realism because nation-states act rationally in serving their interests.
Realism entails the realpolitik of nations, of what is practical and what is pragmatic. In foreign relations, recognizing these interests is direly needed before taking a stand that may either run congruent or contradict with popular public opinion. This stands true since the language of diplomacy is dialogue and concessions serve as its currency. Looking back at the Philippine setting, what do we think of our country’s realpolitik, specially in foreign policy? Citing the three pillars of Philippine foreign policy, which are national security, economic security, and assistance to nationals, what do we think is there for the Philippines in this Ukrainian crisis, and how can these international issues be turned to opportunities? That is only something that the next chief architect of Philippine foreign policy can decide on.
Former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a renowned Soviet academician, mentioned in his book entitled “Russian Crossroads” how former US President Richard Nixon described himself and his Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger as “sons of bitches” in promoting and defending America’s national interests. Nixon’s choice of words might be crass, but it completely reflects the country’s need to adopt pragmatic and amoral policies in enforcing its national interests. Political scientists might use the word Machiavellian, but statesmen are meant to create a peaceful and prosperous environment for all the residents to enjoy.
With the Philippine general elections ending in a couple of months, Filipino voters cannot afford to be swindled anymore. Instead, the electorate ought to choose candidates who know no fear when labelled as “sons or daughters of bitches” in the name of Philippine interests.",Others
Bongbong Marcos: Another Noynoy Aquino and another Kamaganak Inc in the making?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/bongbong-marcos-another-noynoy-aquino-and-another-kamaganak-inc-in-the-making/,"The elephant in the room we need to talk about: Marcos might just turn out to be another Noynoy. This is probably the universe’s way of putting an end to the Marcos-Aquino feud and pave the way for a new leader to rise from the ranks. But fate is cruel. There’s no one on the horizon who has the potential. Vice President Inday Sara Duterte is still raw which is why her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte wanted to mentor her by way of a Bong Go – Duterte ticket in last year’s national elections.
Indeed, Bobi Tiglao, in his Manila Times piece today, points out how “so terribly misinformed about the country’s dispute with China in the South China Sea” President Bongbong Marcos is and that it “is as bad as that of President Benigno Aquino 3rd that led to his unnecessarily belligerent stance toward China, which eventually led to a dangerous standoff at Panatag Shoal and our loss of that territory in 2012.” Tiglao refers to Marcos’s interview by World Economic Forum (WEF) President Børge Brende in Davos last week. Tiglao observes…
Marcos’ saying that China and the Philippines “can’t be sweeping under the rug” the South China Sea dispute would be insulting to the Chinese, whose announced policy on territorial disputes was formulated by China’s revered leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 that became that country’s doctrine: “Set aside dispute and pursue joint development.” That was the slogan that was based from Deng’s lengthier sentence, “Let us put aside this dispute which future generations may have more wisdom to resolve. ”
Marcos also seemed to boast in the interview: “I would not be doing my job if I did not bring up these issues with President Xi when I had the opportunity.” A source who was with Marcos’ delegation to China early this month confirmed that Xi appeared irritated over the President’s insistence on raising the South China Sea issue. “I’m worried that Xi may just decide to ignore the Philippines totally. We need China more than it needs us.”
It’s clear that China has turned cold based on their reception of Marcos during his visit. It’s clear that Marcos is leaning more to the United States instead of China. How the US will pay him back for this fealty remains to be seen. We’re not the only ASEAN country which has a territorial dispute with China. As it has been pointed out, the Spratlys/Paracels have always been a part of China along with Taiwan. What the US and Britain did to China in terms of their territory is no different from how they grabbed Sabah and gave it to Malaysia.
Marcos is evidently bent on projecting himself as a leader who matters in the region. That’s part of his redemption arc which is why there is all this hoopla about “selling the Philippines”. But the truth is we’ve fallen behind our ASEAN neighbors. They are more preferred as investment destinations. For as long as the structural deficiencies exist, we will not attract foreign investments at the same level as that hooked in by Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam among others. The oligarchs as a cheering squad look more like they are guarding their turf or looking to become the conduits for potential foreign investors.
President Marcos needs to lay the groundwork first for an environment that investors would find attractive. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel in the process. The templates are there in terms of what Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have done. The US definitely wants bases in the country to act as deterrent against a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. I doubt if the US will support us in the same manner as it does Ukraine or even Taiwan. Taiwan can’t defend itself from China. The same is true for us. Not even American bases can prevent a Chinese attack if the latter are determined to take Taiwan back.
China is also our top trading partner. We have seen what can happen if the administration is perceived as hostile as what the late Noynoy Aquino did when he was President. Duterte understood this and this is why he adopted a policy of rapprochement towards China and opened the doors again for cooperation with Russia. If Marcos again allows the US to dictate what it wants for the Philippines, he should think twice. History has established that we had always gotten the short end of the stick either way. Marcos should get the best from his father and Duterte and fuse the two together. But this isn’t likely to happen. F. Sionil Jose, in his analysis of what could’ve been had Ninoy come to power believed that Ninoy wouldn’t betray his social class. Marcos is the same considering that the provenance of his family is actually nouveau riche.",Others
Declassified CIA dox reveal Cory Aquino blamed CPP-NPA for human rights abuses in 1988,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/declassified-cia-dox-reveal-cory-aquino-blamed-cpp-npa-for-human-rights-abuses-in-1988/,"Documents publicly-available from the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) website detail reports on human rights violations that allegedly occurred under the administration of President Cory Aquino. The documents, dated between the 15th and the 29th December 1988, cite reports issued by London-based Amnesty International that assert that incidences of torture perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “have increased since the Manila government stepped up its counter-insurgency campaign against Communist rebels”.
The CIA report also quotes then President Aquino who, in her official response to Amnesty international, defends her government and points to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) as the more culpable party involved in any human rights abuse happening in the Philippines.
A report on militant organisations published on the Stanford University website describes how the CPP-NPA is founded on the premise that China is the source of both ideology and resources to effect violent revolution in the Philippines. The report also shows the history of the CPP-NPA’s efforts to solicit support from other terrorist organisations around the world.
From its 1969 establishment until the 1976 normalization of Philippine-Chinese relations, the CPP-NPA received support, weapons, and funds from China. However, even though the CPP-NPA modeled its armed struggle on China’s own Maoist movement, Chinese support for the CPP-NPA seems to have been limited. The CPP-NPA also sought support, weapons, funds, and training from like-minded groups overseas, including the Japanese Red Army (JRA), the Maoist factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the Sandinistas, the Communist Party of El Salvador, and many other organizations…
Most disturbing of all is the account of the Stanford report of events that sealed the record of the CPP-NPA as an enemy of the state as well as the baffling way that its current ally, the Liberal Party (today known as the Yellowtards), contributed to the twisting of facts that led to a confused record of these events.
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
Even back then, the confused nature with which the Philippines’ political leaders respond to clear acts of terrorism was on exhibit. Rather than be unified across partisan interests in condemning a bald atrocity perpetrated by a Cold War enemy the Liberal Party, instead, blamed the attack on the government of then President Ferdinand Marcos.
Liberal Party members blamed President Marcos for the attack, which had killed much of his opposition. Marcos, who blamed the CPP-NPA for the bombing, responded by suppressing leftist political activity and suspending habeas corpus. These measures marked an increase in Marcos’ power. In response to Marcos’ repression, hundreds of student recruits joined the CPP-NPA. [27]  [28] Meanwhile, Sison denied that the CPP-NPA had been involved in the attack.
Things haven’t changed much in the last half-century since.
Today, it is interesting how the current Yellowtard-led Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders.
Indeed, the Yellowtards and their presidential candidate “vice president” Leni Robredo are in bed with legal front groups of the CPP-NPA as they mount a campaign to prevent the rise of leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte. They use the buzzword “red tagging” to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside.
Former Rep. Neri Colmenares who chairs Bayan Muna, one of the legal fronts of the CPP-NPA, is a staunch supporter of Robredo’s bid for the presidency. Not surprisingly, Colmenares would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding with regard to the CPP-NPA’s terrorist activities. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate.
Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections.
“One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent).  That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino.
“The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added.
LOOK: The Makabayan coalition came in full force for presidential bet VP Leni Robredo at the ""Pink Sunday"" rally. Senatorial bet Neri Colmenares was at Quezon Memorial Circle, but he wasn't able to go up on stage as he isn't officially part of Robredo's slate. @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/OhmX4XFr0H
— Mara Cepeda (@maracepeda) February 13, 2022
Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat.
According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda.
He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate.
Note that Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case. These have since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building.
That Yellowtard figurehead Leni Robredo, purported “leader” of the Philippine Opposition today, would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like Colmenares as “partners” in “building a nation” smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of Yellowtardom Cory Aquino herself battled these terrorists.

"Nobody could be bothered to solve Ninoy Aquino’s murder — not even the last two Aquino presidents, his wife and son",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/nobody-could-be-bothered-to-solve-ninoy-aquinos-murder-not-even-the-last-two-aquino-presidents-his-wife-and-son/,"National artist F. Sionil Jose’s PhilSTAR piece today, “Remembering Ninoy”, best sums up Ninoy Aquino who, on this day in 1983, was assassinated. Jose recalls, “Immediately after EDSA I, Lt. Victor Corpuz saw me; he confirmed that Ninoy was really involved with the New People’s Army.”
And so, to this very day we don’t know who really killed Ninoy. It is also inexplicable why Cory as President and her son in the same formidable position have not bothered to resolve the murder. So many of those in the know have died, some under the most suspicious circumstances. Not long ago, retired General Joven Abadia visited me and said that a participant in the conspiracy that killed Ninoy is still around and living in Australia. It should not be difficult to locate him and have him talk.
Ninoy was  not the hero he was cast out to be after his assassination. A lot of us boomers were fooled then because we didn’t have access to information like we do now. Some say he experienced a transformation while incarcerated. This was the justification for his martyrdom. But if you have the ability of introspection, you will be able to place yourself in Ninoy’s mindset and think about what you would do if you were in his shoes? What was his obsession with the Presidency? Why couldn’t he wait?
It was a fact that he met Imelda before Marcos did and was smitten by her. But Imelda didn’t have the money of Cory. The Cojuangcos needed a politically-savvy husband for Cory who could do what her brothers couldn’t for the family. Not too many people know Ninoy was close to Cory’s cousin Danding. Ninoy, Danding and Dee Teodoro would go out gallivanting at Dewey Boulevard. They would closet themselves in a private room at the premiere nightclub of their choice and drink and enjoy the women’s company.
Ninoy and Danding were both warlords in the true sense of the word. This is why Ninoy entrusted his top lieutenants, the Pineda brothers, Susing and Chit, to Danding after his arrest. The two would go on to help Danding build his business and political empire. Danding provided Ninoy with money during his Boston exile. Tita Ellen Soriano attested to this. The monies were paid out of Danding’s Los Angeles office and transfered to Ninoy’s account in Boston. How could Danding have any involvement in Ninoy’s murder?
Thirty-eight years to the day, the mastermind has never been identified despite two members of his immediate family becoming President. It’s about time we end the fallacy of Ninoy Aquino being a hero. To begin with, there is no law that makes him one. There is only this holiday which only serves to divide, instead of unify Filipinos.

The rise and fall of Afghan president Ashraf Ghani mirrors US puppetry in Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-mirrors-us-puppetry-in-philippine-politics/,"Why does the rise of Ashraf Ghani to President of US-occupied Afghanistan in 2014, sound so familiar? This is because it has been the mold by which the US has implemented its hegemony.
A report published that December by European Union electoral observers concluded that there had indeed been rampant fraud in the June [2014] election. More than 2 million votes, representing over one-quarter of the total cast, had come from polling stations with overt irregularities.
Whether or not Ghani actually won the run-off was nebulous. But he had managed to get over the finish line, and that was all that mattered. He was president now. And his imperial patrons in Washington were more than happy to sweep the scandal under the rug.
Think of the Philippines prior to independence and the creation of the Liberal Party under Manuel Roxas. Under President Ferdinand Marcos, the template was the same but, at that time, there was the threat of communism so that fueled the rise of Asian strongmen; Lee Kuan Yew, Suharto, and Marcos. Martial law was condoned but the economy was run by the International Monetary Fund – World Bank (IMF-WB).
When Marcos ran afoul of the Americans, it was Ninoy Aquino’s turn. His fifteen seconds of fame came in 1983 at the tarmac of the airport now named after him. The guarantee given was Marcos would fall within a year but that didn’t happen. Marcos got suckered into calling the snap election. We all know what happened after that in 1986. It took us another thirty years before we finally got the President we needed.
Today, the Philippines is at another crossroads of history with elections in 2022 to determine how the country will move forward in the pandemic environment. But there is also the matter of the political choice the Filipino will make; will it be the continuity of an independent Philippines or will it mark a return to the arms of Uncle Sam? Afghanistan at least got billions or even trillions of dollars while the Philippines has nothing to show for its subservience to the US from 1946-2016.
Recall how former Defense Minister/Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile recounted before President Duterte how badly they were treated during the Marcos administration when they were reduced to begging for military hardware despite the presence of US bases in the country. The fact that we were a former colony didn’t even count. But what was missing in the Philippines was present in Afghanistan. There was a war with profits to be made. The war machine favored the US military-industrial complex. It also allowed the export of neoliberal ideology which was also what the Arab spring was all about. But look at what it wrought in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Look at Iraq and Afghanistan now.
The US continued its destabilization efforts in China by way of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong has been shut down while Taiwan remains in play and is a veritable powder keg. The problem is it will take some time to live down the Afghanistan fiasco which has exploded in President Joe Biden’s lap. There is already talk that Biden might be a one-term President like Jimmy Carter who had his chance at reelection blown by the Islamic Revolution in Iran which triggered the hostage crisis.
The story of Afghanistan makes for a better script than the narcos of South America and the Iran-Contra scandal. On one side you have the US supporting a corrupt government while on the other, you have Islamic fundamentalists who are also a US creation raising monies through the drug trade. The fall of Afghanistan is reminiscent of Batista in Cuba who also ran away with the money but in his case, it wasn’t all from the American taxpayers because some of it was from La Cosa Nostra. Afghanistan is also a slap on the collective faces of the American neoliberal establishment. Their Philippine counterparts must be cringing because it couldn’t come at a worse time when the election is less than a year away and they don’t even have a viable candidate.
It thus begs the proverbial question, who will Uncle Sam bless as his anointed? Ladies and gentlemen of the Philippines, this is what the Opposition is part of. This is the ideology they are preaching and selling. It is up to you to make the choice come May 2022.",Others
Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Ball and Chain in the Old Oak Tree,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/tie-a-yellow-ribbon-on-the-ball-and-chain-in-the-old-oak-tree/,"I’m comin’ home, I’ve done my time
Now I’ve got to know what is and isn’t mine…”
The people has spoken and punctuated it with rage that drove the final nails to the coffin of the Yellowtards’ political dreams. A seething anger to be exact.
It has been the goal of the Yellows-turned-Pink for six years to use anger that supposedly will come from the electorate, to use it against Duterte and all the remnants of the strongman Marcos Senior’s regime.
But unfortunately for them, that rage they were trying to incite in the people against the government backfired. They’ve realized (albeit a bit too late) that they’ve already alienated the very ones who they want to be on their side. And they’ve waken up into the nightmare that they were already dealing with:
Engaging the toxic Yellow army head on was futile, so the ordinary voters figured. For who can withstand the constant vitriol and all the personal attacks?
And so the people just waited for the perfect moment for redemption: May 9th 2022.
They know fully well that it’s the perfect opportunity to say the F-word and “screw you” in a civilized and democratic way.
And that, they did with finality and emphasis – 16M times for the presidency and 21M times for the vice presidency.
Finally, the “bobo” and the “tanga” electorate as the Yellowtards relished to name the people outside of their echo chambers, finally had a new meaning to the old song symbolizing LP’s return to power:
Now the whole damned bus is cheerin’
And I can’t believe I see –
– the Yellowtards and Pinklawans met with a hundred yellow ribbons round the ball and chain that’ll be tied to their feet in the ole oak tree,
never to rape the lands again and be free.”",Others
"History repeats itself: how Maria Ressa, like Aguinaldo, Paterno and Buencamino, sold Filipinos out to FOREIGN colonial powers",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/history-repeats-itself-how-maria-ressa-like-aguinaldo-paterno-and-buencamino-sold-filipinos-out-to-foreign-colonial-powers/,"National artist for literature F. Sionil Jose has been copping a lot of flak for his audacity in stating that Maria Ressa does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. He has been maligned by prominent personalities and “thought leaders” of the Opposition. Some of them actually have questionable provenances with regard to their prominence. These half-assed prominent personalities don’t even bother to distinguish in their criticism. Sionil Jose is a national artist for literature. If ever he would be awarded a Nobel, it would be for literature not for “peace”.
What exactly has Ressa done to advance the cause of peace? It’s not like the Philippines is a failed state such as Syria or Libya, both of which were the doing of the US pushing with regime-change during the Arab Spring. Ressa’s fans can only claim the “harassment” of Rappler by the government but Rappler remains open. They lump in the denial of a franchise for ABS-CBN without taking into account the fact that a franchise is a privilege, not a right. The sole basis for Ressa’s prize is her “standing up” to President Rodrigo Duterte — a narrative that is largely of her own making. I doubt that the President is bothered by Rappler and Ressa. The cases are pending in the courts. The last libel suit against Rappler and Ressa was settled. It didn’t come to a judgment. What stands is her previous conviction, which is under appeal. In short, she’s being given due process under the law.
What’s dangerous now is how low the quality of our public intellectuals are. If the defenders of Ressa aren’t capable of civil discourse then what’s the point? The fact that they mostly resort to argumentum ad hominem, as noted broadcast journalist Howie Severino did when he criticised Jose’s writing style without addressing the points he made, only proves that their intellectual capacity is lacking. But this is usually the case when your position is weak and indefensible. What’s more dangerous is there is no journalist worth his or her salt who would dare go against Ressa and Rappler. The facts behind Rappler’s funding by Pierre Omidyar are there for all to read. It is not a white paper but supported by facts because Rappler and Ressa did receive the monies. If Duterte really wanted to pin down Ressa, he would’ve been able to do so, one way or the other.
What is more disturbing is the hypocrisy that accompanies the Ressa defense. She isn’t even a Filipino citizen to begin with. In fact, she is a foreign agent operating in the country and openly challenging the government. Condoning this act is treason. But never mind. What is important is the largesse flows to those in and around Maria — she who has been praised by Biden, Obama and Bono. Proof that, up to today, Filipinos are content to suffer the fools of the past; Aguinaldo, Paterno and Buencamino, who murdered the true patriots and sold us out to foreigners. We are such pathetic idiots if we will condone these acts of treason and not take a stand against it.",Others
Character-based politics and why it should stop,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/character-based-politics-and-why-it-should-stop/,"The Philippines concluded its recently held general elections, where we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in Philippine history. The Marcos-Duterte tandem, together with a number of their publicly endorsed senatorial candidates, are expected to serve their national positions this coming June. The Marcos-Duterte ticket won by a landslide, garnering around 60% of the total votes, where the incoming Marcos administration is expected to have tremendous political mandate with such a majority. The next government is bound to materialize their platforms, and it begins with choosing and appointing competent private citizens or politicians to various positions. But beyond the results of the sacred ballot boxes, the recent elections exposed how polarizing Philippine politics can be, which can be traced on how hapless the current 1987 constitution really is.
After Corazon Aquino was pushed to the presidency in 1986, a process to change the 1973 Philippine constitution gained traction. In turn, this gave birth to the 1987 constitution, which is basically a continuation of the presidential system introduced by the Americans during the Philippine Commonwealth years. This system of government perpetuated various political and social malaise due to these constitutional limitations that restricted the state and the society in participatory nation-building. Even though the Philippines has a longer history of democracy in comparison to other countries in the Indo-Pacific region, the country didn’t seem to bother to create these inclusive institutions. As a result, various socio-political symptoms persisted and worsened due to character-based politics promoted by this presidential system of government.
The first socio-political symptom is the tremendous influence wielded by the landed gentry and the elites. Tracing back the faulty land tenure programs instituted way back from the Spanish colonial era’s “encomiendas“, these landed elites became similar to European feudal lords during the middle ages. Their primary interest lies on how to expand or maintain their political clout and were never interested in emancipating their tenants from perennial servitude. Their loyalty was never to the country where they belong to but on what is more economically beneficial to them. Due to the Philippines’ inefficient and often altogether ineffective bureaucracy, there are virtually no incentives to enfranchise the lower strata of the society.
The second symptom deals with the toxic relationship of showbiz and politics where, with the nature of Philippine elections, popularity is the name of the game. The mass media and entertainment businesses are willing victims and perpetrators of such games, specially when we see politicians use publicity to cement name recall when elections come. These aforementioned politicians build on working relationships with popular showbiz personalities, hoping that an endorsement would provide the necessary votes to deliver them to public office. This can be noticed further as how these political campaigns are performed, which is uncannily similar to Philippine noon-time variety shows. As a result, candidates resort to singing and dancing, no matter how hilarious they end up looking.
Finally, the last symptom that is being perpetuated by the 1987 constitution is with regard to political dynasties. Numerous political analysts and scientists are quick to identify the detrimental effects of political dynasties, where these political families engage in strategically occupying various posts in both national and local governments. The most common strategy is for a popular family member to occupy any government seat and leave notable legacies in a locality. However, with term limits specified by the constitution, that politician would eye a different electoral position instead, while letting his/her wife, husband, or children inherit that position, which he/she has initially occupied. As such, these term restrictions, which were installed with good intentions, end up creating a system more susceptible to corruption.
These three above-mentioned socio-political dilemmas are mere symptoms that manifest the deeper structural and institutional flaws of the current constitution of the Philippines. The 1987 constitution perpetuates an electoral system where the electorate becomes enamored and fanaticized more on the politicians themselves, rather than their advocacies, principles, and platforms. The Philippine-style “padrino” system has blended uniquely with this character-centric politics where affiliations and allegiances clearly define gainers and losers. As a result, this has relegated meritocracy to the backseat and has visibly lowered state capacity. In addition, this enfranchises public servants to switch alliances, creating turncoats before they become victims of a sinking ship. How can we create a strong republic if such systems disincentive technocracy and instead, favor political patronage?
The Philippine state and the Filipino society should only look at accomplishing one primary objective and that is about creating, perfecting, and preserving inclusive economic and political institutions. These inclusive institutions identify flourishing nation-states and formidable countries that can respond when critical junctures happen. This can be seen with how British history unfolded and how the British state and society pedaled its way towards prosperity.
Prior to the industrial revolution that afforded London the terminology “Pax Britannica” during the 19th century, two significant historical junctures compelled the United Kingdom to create these institutions. The first is when parliament clashed with the English king because of religion and taxation, where the Parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell emerged victorious in this civil war. English society was adamant in its position against the desires of the English king to raise taxes, creating a political gridlock between the monarchy and the parliament which ended in a regicide when King Charles I was executed, leading to the interregnum. In the end, the monarchy returned and later exacted vengeance against the acts of regicide, where Oliver Cromwell himself was executed posthumously. Needless to say, the English society through the parliament acted as a balancer to the excesses of the English monarchical leviathan.
The second juncture is when the Dutch leader William III landed on England and governed the kingdom with his wife, Mary II, deposing King James II. With the dreaded memories from the civil war, the Glorious Revolution was a relatively peaceful transition of power, which afforded British sovereignty not to the crown, but to the parliament. But the most noteworthy is the passage of the Bill of Rights, which put to writing various freedoms and rights of individuals, establishing an environment suitable for participatory and plurality politics. Both the English civil war and the Glorious Revolution created not only inclusive institutions, but also a mutually strong state and society.
Political reformation in Britain happened due to these inclusive institutions, which strengthened individuals to actively participate in politics. However, the lousy 1987 constitution fails to level the playing field between the wealthy and the destitute, and between the strong and the frail. Transforming a constitution that will emphasize coalition-building and consensus-building is a better, cost-effective approach to transitioning when these institutions are adopted. Constitutional reform isn’t a panacea that cures these malaises, but changing the rules as to how politics and economics should be played will undoubtedly make the country more prepared in answering these future challenges that lie ahead.",Others
Only charter change following the 2022 elections will see the last of plurality presidents and a more unified Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/only-charter-change-following-the-2022-elections-will-see-the-last-of-plurality-presidents-and-a-more-unified-philippines/,"Why are Filipinos so disunited thirty-five years after Ferdinand Marcos was ousted? The answer lies in part to the unanswered question of who actually won the 1986 Snap Election. Marcos claimed victory. When the RAM mounted a coup and failed at the onset, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile verified the claim of the then opposition that Marcos cheated. That became the basis for the assumption of Cory Aquino to the Presidency.
Between 1986 and 2016, there were two hotly-contested elections; 1992 and 2004. Poll data shows that the Marcos camp could’ve won the 1992 election if only Imelda Marcos hadn’t run. Danding Cojuangco would win by a plurality over Fidel Ramos and Miriam Santiago. Yet Cojuangco lost in large part due to the efforts of Ramos who sent Roquito Ablan to meet with Imelda and convince her to run against Danding with whom she had a rift with.
This was repeated in 2004 again because of Joseph Estrada’s ouster by a civil-military coup in 2001. The Yellows mustered enough protests to bring down Estrada from power over perceived corruption. He was the first President impeached and tried by the Senate. The House prosecutors walked out of the trial in protest over a key ruling they lost the vote on because Estrada had the numbers. It was a foregone conclusion that he would be acquitted and the then opposition would have none of this outcome. They took to the streets for EDSA 2. Mob rule triumphed over the rule of law again. Erap’s proxy, Fernando Poe Jr (FPJ), lost the 2004 election where it was revealed that then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was caught on tape speaking with election operator and Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Director Virgilio Garcillano. The Hello Garci scandal wasn’t enough to oust GMA but it did earn her the distinction of the most unpopular post-Marcos President.
Today, the rift is between those who favor the strongman Presidential style of Rodrigo Duterte over the leftist-militant-liberal ideology of today’s Opposition. The 1987 Constitution’s inherent defect allows the election of a plurality President where the losers will always say that the winner didn’t obtain a clear majority. The Yellows and Reds are basically sore losers. When the anti-Yellow politicians lost the election in 2010 with the victory of Noynoy Aquino, they cooperated with his administration. It was Aquino who pursued his personal vendetta against his political enemies by having them charged and detained on plunder raps.
The 2022 election has five declared candidates for President. This ensures another plurality President unless one of them actually garners enough votes for a majority win. This is also dependent on what the voters’ sentiments actually are; strongman rule or one that goes back to the ideology of the opposition.
The Yellows and the Reds are the cause of this political dysfunction because of their continuing refusal to entertain the idea of changing the form of government. All of this can be avoided by putting in place a run-off provision or a wholesale change to a federal parliamentary system which would allow for autonomous regions to spur development. Duterte did not act on this particular campaign promise of his but there were several attempts on the part of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to test the waters including the formation of an inter-agency task force.
It doesn’t help that it appears that the major power blocs supporting Duterte have gone on their own for the 2022 election cycle. Both the administration and opposition camps are in disarray with the latter having it worse because there are the camps of Vice President Leni Robredo and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso competing for votes. It remains to be seen how the candidacy of Manny Pacquiao will pan out as he has the weakest campaign organization among the three.
I really hope that charter change will be on the agenda of either the administration bet or that of the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto ticket if only to serve as the solution for the achievement of national unity. The Philippines’ political divisiveness has exacted a heavy toll on the country’s development because the lack of continuity has made the Philippines unattractive to foreign direct investment. The county badly needs foreign direct investments (FDIs) if it’s to bring down its level of borrowing to make up for the revenue shortfall brought about by the disruption caused by the pandemic. There is also the urgent need to amend the Constitutional provisions limiting foreign ownership of corporations and land.",Others
"Opposition infighting cancelling out Isko Moreno and Leni Robredo camps, paving the way for either a Marcos or Lacson win",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/opposition-infighting-cancelling-out-isko-moreno-and-leni-robredo-camps-paving-the-way-for-either-a-marcos-or-lacson-win/,"Too much drama in the Opposition camp. The way Boo Chanco tells it in his PhilSTAR piece “Keep focused” smacks of historical revisionism. According to Chanco, the Reds “tricked” Cory into releasing them after she “ousted” Marcos. He should he call them out for what they really are — political opportunists prostituting their organizations. Their release was the reason why the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) went against the administration just a couple of months after February 1986 which began the string of coup attempts against Cory.
Chanco claims the Reds went for Gringo Honasan and Ping Lacson in 2004 but this is false. The Reds hold RAM responsible for the killings of Rolando Olalia and Lean Alejandro. Lacson was under Col. Rolly Abadilla at the Military Intelligence and Security Group (MISG). What Chanco doesn’t mention is the Reds gained ground under the administration of Fidel Ramos with the peace talks and the passage of the enabling law for party-list representatives which the Reds exploited to the hilt and gave rise to the Makabayan Bloc in the House of Representatives. President Joseph “Erap” Estrada forged a broad coalition in 1998 with Boy Morales and Edicio De La Torre representing the Reds. They dumped Erap for Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and dumped GMA again for Noynoy Aquino. But Akbayan had the upper hand as Ronald Llamas became Political Affairs Adviser of PNoy. In 2010, they coalesced with the Nacionalistas and ran together with Bongbong Marcos for the Senate. Come 2016, they went for Grace Poe and Neri Colmenares was in the same slate as Isko Moreno.
Chanco tries very hard to justify the Senate slate of Leni Robredo but fails. If the basis is the lesser evil then it should comes down to the NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA coalition, some of whose candidates have been adopted by Robredo. Why vote for the Pinklawans when the Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is more organized and has a better platform compared to Robredo and her ilk who still continue to stumble in the dark despite her being Vice-President for the past five years? Voters who are neither pro-Opposition or pro-Administration will consider first the Lacson-Sotto ticket. Surveys haven’t really focused on this niche at all but it is growing. Another consideration is the fact that the 21-45 demographic, which is 40 million strong were born between  2001 – 1977. Those who are 45 were nine years old when Marcos was ousted so they grew up under the Yellows. Those who are 21 were born the year GMA became President. They came of mind during the PNoy administration and as adults under the present administration. For sure, they have witnessed the stark difference in governance.
It’s not likely probable also that this demographic will go for Isko even if he comes from it for the simple reason that those in the upper range will question his ability to lead and govern given his experience and track record. But, as it is, the bickering is inside the Robredo camp and that of Isko, and between the two. The net effect is they are cancelling each other out even before the official campaign period begins. The opposition might as well be branded as the That’s Entertainment group because that’s all they’re good for. The men get separated from the boys and, the way it’s looking, it will be a race between Senators Lacson and Marcos. This is actually more beneficial to the public became there will be no bickering, mudslinging and black propaganda. It will be an issues-based campaign between two gentlemen, which is actually the kind of politics we need.",Others
Former Ambassador and Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao banned by Facebook after criticising Ateneo Martial Law Museum!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/former-ambassador-and-manila-times-columnist-bobi-tiglao-banned-by-facebook-after-criticising-ateneo-martial-law-museum/,"Is the Ateneo de Manila Martial Law Museum so sacred as to be above any challenge to its legitimacy as an authority on what really happened over the period the late Ferdinand Marcos was president of the Philippines? Apparently so. In a tweet issued today, Manila Times columnist and former ambassador Bobi Tiglao, revealed that he had been banned by social media behemoth Facebook from posting any content, seemingly after he challenged an instructor there, a certain Miguel Paolo Rivera, on the subject.
Yesterday, Tiglao posted the following query on the legitimacy of this “Martial Law Museum” on Facebook…
Public query to the Ateneo de Manila University:
Is the “Ateneo Martial Law Museum” an authorized unit of the univeristy? I know of only one Museum in the University, the Art Gallery. (I remember the Observatory also had a museum, but it isn’t open to public.) It’s irrelevant [if] this Martial Law museum is “digital’. It is using the University’s prestige as a academic institution with academic standards.
…to which neither the Ateneo nor Rivera have so far responded.
This is hardly surprising. The Ateneo has long been known to be a den of Yellowtardism (the ideology of “activists” rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan). Indeed, the Ateneo has been reportedly linked to demolition campaigns against the Philippine government organised by the Yellowtards. In 2019, a series of YouTube videos dubbed “Ang Totoong Narcolist” emerged featuring a hooded figure named “Bikoy” who tagged President Rodrigo Duterte’s family in the drug trade. “Bikoy” was later unmasked and revealed to be Peter Joemel Advincula who later testified he met with a number of members of the Roman Catholic clergy as well as former Education Secretary Armin Luistro and that these meetings “centered on how to publicize a story that the President’s allies and family were linked to illegal drugs, to unseat Duterte, and to ensure the defeat of administration-backed senatorial candidates in the recently concluded elections.” In his 27th May affidavit, Advincula reportedly “claimed that [Archbishop Socrates Villegas of Lingayen-Dagupan and former head of the CBCP] was present at a meeting on Dec. 12 at the Jesuit Residence at Ateneo de Manila University.”
For its part, Facebook is policed by “fact check” partner Vera Files which is headed by Yellowtard “journalist” Ellen Tordesillas. When the “Bikoy” videos first emerged, Tordesillas was quick to blog about how the videos “look professionally done” and were “uploaded on You Tube and Facebook [under the] account of ‘Metro Balita’, which lists itself as ‘media/news company’.” A who’s who of Yellowtard “activists” and influencers followed suit to share the videos. No less than then Inquirer editor John Nery himself issued rave reviews about the “Bikoy” videos, proclaiming “THIS is the real (video) scandal” as he too shared a link to the video.
Tordesillas is also a staunch supporter of convicted mutineer and former Yellowtard “senator” Antonio Trillanes who Advincula later reportedly testified was among those behind the “Bikoy” job.
Advincula also said his claims were “orchestrated” by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV and the Liberal Party, a claim immediately denied by an official official of the group and an ally of the lawmaker.
It is indeed disturbing that one single authority (or an “accredited” cabal of them) can summarily cancel content on Facebook with neither channel to challenge these cancellations nor room for the community of content publishers to police themselves. The clique of “fact-checkers” that VERA Files is part of is an inbred group within which mere beliefs are propagated and amplified and challenges to these summarily dismissed or ignored. I highlighted the bald dishonesty inherent to these cliques and the flawed logic such echo chambers produce in my article “Let us all please FACT CHECK the VERA Files ‘fact check’ on Drilon’s dozing off incident on TV!” where I point out just how crooked VERA Files‘ approach to “fact checking” really is using the Drilon dozing off incident…
It is interesting to note that VERA Files used sources from only one side of the story — that of CNN Philippines and its contracted talent Pinky Webb. It did not even manage to secure a full unedited version of the footage and used a mere “screen grab” to “prove” that Drilon was, over the course of the brief footage, reading off documents on his desk. VERA Files had no third party to corroborate the “evidence” it presents — only itself and CNN Philippines and certain parties under its payroll. It seems VERA Files could not even be bothered to take a statement from Senator Drilon himself.
Furthermore, the footage used in this “fact check” was taken directly from the published and edited version of the interview.
This leads us to wonder how many more articles and how much more information that reveals similar disturbing facts are being suppressed by “fact-checkers” like Tordesillas and her VERA Files organisation. It is indeed ironic that Tordesillas and her ilk including “activists” and “thought leaders” of today’s Philippine Opposition repeatedly remind people to be vigilant and routinely apply critical minds to the information they find on the Net. As it turns out, Tordesillas and her amigas are the biggest offenders. It’s time Filipinos think twice about the trust they put in people like her and the camps she is allied with who claim to be the “decent” mob.
You wonder then why people like Tordesillas who had been caught many times spreading disinformation gets to be “fact checker” for Facebook. Even more interesting, the Ateneo itself along with Nery, Villegas, the CBCP, and Luistro have all so far copped no consequences whatsoever for their involvement in the “Bikoy” fiasco. That Tiglao would now be banned from posting on Facebook is an outrage that needs to be highlighted and the hypocrisy of those who crown themselves authorities on all that is “decent” in the Philippines be subject to long-overdue challenge.",Others
Bongbong Marcos set to vindicate his father in what is to become his family’s FINAL battle with the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/bongbong-marcos-set-to-vindicate-his-father-in-what-is-to-become-his-familys-final-battle-with-the-yellowtards/,"Inquirer columnist Richard Heydarian gets it wrong again in his piece “Why the Marcos brand remains popular”. True to his drumroll style of writing where he first goes at length into some historical context for the point he would later make way way towards the end of his blurb, Heydarian starts by showing off his “knowledge” of German history writing about how “the well-meaning yet feeble Weimar Republic collapsed under the pressure of polarized and increasingly authoritarian politics, leading to the rise of Nazism.” Well, not really. The Weimar Republic collapsed because of weak leadership under the onerous terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Allies wanted to bleed Germany dry for war reparations so they could repay their debt to the United States. Hitler’s rise began shortly after and the rest, as they say, is history.
Then Heydarian goes into template mode drawing a parallel from that to apply to his take on what is happening to the Philippines today claiming that “the gathering storm of authoritarian nostalgia, and the growing appeal of the heirs of our former dictator, can be explained along a similar axis.” Thus; “[our] political leaders as well as our educators also fell far short in accomplishing their basic duties following the collapse of Ferdinand Marcos’ regime more than three decades earlier.” What followed the so-called EDSA “revolution” that supposedly toppled the Marcos regime “was the swift restoration of the old liberal elite, many of whom ended up reasserting their grip not only on the pillars of the economy but also on the vital organs of the state,” writes Heydarian.
The fact is, history was written by the victors. There was really no “revolution” at EDSA and no victory by the opposition against Marcos. It was then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile who tried to grab power plain and simple but failed. Marcos was consumed by his own hubris that he didn’t appoint a successor nor laid out a succession plan after he became seriously ill. His camp was already divided into three factions then; his wife Imelda and General Fabian Ver, Fidel Ramos and Enrile and Danding Cojuangco. Ramos and Enrile also parted ways before 1986. Danding thought that neither had it in them to mount a coup despite the rise of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM). Cojuangco relied on the loyalty of the officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to Marcos. Little did he know that he would need to go into exile ignominiously when the time came.
The matter could’ve been settled as early as 1992 but the Yellows wouldn’t give up power easily. Danding lost because the Marcos vote was split by Imelda. Joseph “Erap” Estrada was ousted after three years and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) completed her term but only because she gave the police and military what they wanted. She suffered the same fate as Erap. By the end of the Noynoy Aquino administration, Ramos had seen enough and activated his old network to get Rodrigo Duterte to run. Ramos thought he could control Duterte but the promdi had other plans. And so here we are again today in an election cycle where the Marcos scion is now the principal player in what is to be the final battle between the Yellows and the Marcoses. Is it a battle or is it just a validation of the people’s choice in 2016?
Duterte’s audacity in spending political capital is unprecedented. Going into his final eight months in office, he remains highly-popular. Few realize the situation he is in now where he has been abandoned by the power blocs supporting him because they don’t want him to build up a power bloc independent from them. Not a word has been heard from Manny Villar and GMA. The PDP-Laban is splintered and the father is caught in a feud with his daughter, who was supposed to succeed him. The loyal aide looks to be a party to the isolation of his principal as he himself has learned how to play the game. They would like to control the anointed successor who isn’t keen on being a sock puppet which is why she took herself out of the game. But she is playing her cards well by engaging in a dialogue with the Marcos’ who’s also in the same boat as her father.
The power blocs are afraid that what they stole from the Marcoses in their time of weakness will be taken back and they will be left at the mercies of what will be the Marcos-Duterte combine. Ironic since the president’s late father and former Davao Governor Vicente Duterte was a victim of a power play in the first Marcos Cabinet. Now the two sons of the patriarchs are in a position to vindicate their respective fathers. Duterte is keeping his cards close to his chest. He knows his work isn’t done yet but he understands that if the country is to have a future, it falls upon him to finish what he started, one way or the other. The Filipino is waiting for November 15 anxiously. The 2022 election could be a protracted battle or it could end before May 2022.",Others
China relations is a critical foreign policy issue of the incoming administration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/china-relations-is-a-critical-foreign-policy-issue-of-the-incoming-administration/,"Beyond the turmoil and bloodshed of Chinese nationalism, the Chinese Communist Party was officially founded a century ago. The Chinese civilization suffered humiliation in the hands of Western powers and its rising neighbor, Imperial Japan. As the Russians were challenging their northern borders, the Japanese expanded their territory in Manchuria. Tokyo and its military capability seemed boundless, as they encroached on Chinese territory, further weakening the Kuomintang who defiantly resisted Japanese militarism. Following the dropping of ferocious bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki paired with Soviet annexation of South Sakhalin, Japan surrendered in 1945 and, later, the Chinese Civil War erupted that pitted the Communists against the Kuomintang. The latter suffered great losses, which caused them to retreat to modern-day Taiwan. On the other hand, the former gained the upper hand, declaring the formation of the People’s Republic in 1949. During this time, Chinese communism was overshadowed by a man named Mao Zedong.
Chairman Mao Zedong is being credited as the man who gave birth to what China is today, even though numerous political scientists and economic analysts strongly denounce his methods, policies, and innumerable atrocities. When Deng Xiaoping took over, he positioned the People’s Republic to adopt socialism with Chinese characteristics, where economic liberalization jumpstarted the economy and was enhanced with the adoption of special economic zones which, in turn, became the foundations for the transformation of China’s skyline. Years of impressive economic growth lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty, and then came Xi Jinping.
President Xi Jinping is one of the most powerful men on this planet, heading a country with the largest population armed with nuclear weapons. As the face of the People’s Republic, he has the second biggest economy behind him despite his authoritarian tendencies that are far from being unnoticeable. He plans to make China a significant player in the world stage while leaving a legacy for his country — a commitment that is making other nations uneasy. Unfortunately, the Philippines is one of those neighboring countries. With such realities, what should the in-coming Philippine president do to address rising Chinese assertiveness?
According to John Mearsheimer, the author of The Tragedy of Great Power Politics and a renowned intellectual in the field of international relations, there are five assumptions that should be considered in my attempt to apply the theory of offensive realism in this context. First, the international order is in a state of anarchy, where there is no hierarchy of countries. Second, each country has a degree of exerting offensive military power through their population and wealth. Third, countries are unsure of the intentions of others. Fourth, a country’s survival is its primary interest. Lastly, all nation-states act rationally in accordance to their interests. These bedrock assumptions can be witnessed as to how historical and global politics have unfolded.
In the Philippine setting, Chinese assertions in the South China Sea are becoming more aggressive. Aside from the various military outposts that are being constructed, various naval vessels are being stationed along these areas. These range from relatively small fishing ships that are manned by Chinese militia under the guise of being ordinary fishermen, to larger patrol cutters that have the words “China Coast Guard” written on their decks. They even have the capability to stay afloat in tropical storms due to their massive tonnage. This salami-slicing approach of territorial acquisition caused various concerns beyond Southeast Asia as the aforementioned sea is an important trade route where various goods are shipped internationally. The Chinese behemoth is acting not in terms of what is accepted as morally sound by international standards, but in accordance to what Beijing thinks as its “realpolitik”. Chinese behavior in these waters cannot be checked and the arbitration ruling in The Hague cannot be implemented due to the international order’s anarchic nature. As such, Beijing has no need to bow down to international pressure and popular public opinion, since they also have the veto card in the United Nations’ Security Council. However, Manila has a few cards under its sleeve and if played wisely, might make the China issue more bearable than what it currently seems.
As an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member state, the Philippines must find methods in searching and aligning mutual interests in the ASEAN community. Manila cannot impose its wants through ASEAN because other member states treat and value their respective China relations differently. Cooperation and intensified talks with Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Hanoi can provide hints in addressing such issues, specially when considering that their relationships with Beijing are far from cordial. As a primary trading partner of Japan, which also has disputes with the People’s Republic, ensuring a shared policy of monitoring the seas is important. This is of utter importance due to the fact that Beijing’s first and second island chains include portions of Japanese and Philippine waters. Finally, as a major non-NATO ally of the United States, negotiating terms to strengthen Philippine military infrastructure is imperative since a Manila having the ability to proactively check Chinese aggressions is also a win for American diplomacy, due to Washington’s historical tendency to act as an offshore balancer.
With the next Presidential elections coming this May, Manila will have a new chief architect of foreign policy. The Duterte administration attempted to search for means to resolve these disputes but only garnered limited gains. Ideally, a more consistent yet versatile approach is needed specially because diplomacy is not a game for the feeble-minded. When Filipinos practice their right to suffrage, the electorate must look for a presidential candidate who possesses the diplomatic dexterity and finesse to employ strategic ambiguity accordingly. This territorial dispute with Beijing, which has been on the President’s table for a number of decades, has seen no favorable resolution so engaging China through diplomacy will be a battle of attrition. The future president must know when to raise the stakes, and when to de-escalate the situation. It is through Chinese relations where the Philippine president’s mettle will be rigorously tested.
Presidents Richard Nixon’s and Gerald Ford’s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and in his renowned book Diplomacy points out that military action and diplomatic recourse should come hand-to-hand lest one be witness to an undesirable outcome. Kissinger stated that Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck’s ability to balance out internal politics and foreign affairs is outstanding, as his leadership witnessed German expansion and unity in Denmark in 1864, Austria in 1866, and France in 1870. A pragmatic policy in the name of national interests must also be adopted in the Philippines, more so that a country’s internal situation greatly influences how it can play global politics. Following Mearsheimer’s second assumption in his theory of offensive realism, the country can amplify its offensive power through wealth generation, which can be achieved by empowering the economy, liberalizing the market, and continuous investment in the fields of research and development. Thus, correcting the current constitution can indirectly assist in providing better cards for Manila to play in the field of diplomacy.
However, diplomacy itself is only half of the game. Strengthening the ability of the Philippine armed forces is a national imperative if we are to keep our territorial integrity intact. Chinese encroachments will not cease anytime in the immediate future. The Chinese Coast Guard will continue to harass our fisherfolk, endangering livelihood and employment opportunities of the country. The military must possess the capability to deny and counter these provocative actions by ensuring that the Philippines has command over its seas plus the ability to demonstate credible aerial superiority. A sound military strategy combined with pragmatic diplomacy would yield a formidable national security framework. This will only come to fruition if the incoming chief architect of foreign policy and incoming commander-in-chief possesses the core competencies required to keep on top of the rigors of the presidency.",Others
Getting the Philippines to Denmark (Part I),https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/06/getting-the-philippines-to-denmark-part-i/,"The Philippines had recently celebrated its 125th Independence Day. It is a celebration that symbolizes how Filipino forefathers have broken the shackles of centuries-long Spanish imperialism and colonialism. It also serves as a reminder to reflect on the sacrifices of Filipinos in pursuing the path towards self-determination. As June 12, 1898 became a date when the Filipino people attempted to liberate itself from its powerful Western colonizers, two questions continue to persist even after 125 years, and seem to attract no conclusive answers. Is the Philippines a free country, and do Filipinos live lives with freedom? The first question pertains to the Philippine state, while the second question is about the Philippine society. These types of multi-dimensional questions require multiple points of view and perspectives to answer.
Technically speaking, the Philippines did not enjoy its freedom after General Emilio Aguinaldo declared the country’s independence from Spain. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Madrid sold and transferred the ownership of its colonial possessions to the United States, then a rising global hegemon. Aside from the Philippine Islands, Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico were also included in the aforementioned treaty. With these territories, the United States began acquiring new territories beyond its home continent, which is eerily similar with how their European counterparts in the United Kingdom and France expanded their respective empires.
Washington’s geopolitical ambitions began to take shape during the McKinley administration as the United States became politically powerful and economically wealthy. With the United States becoming more involved in protecting its own economic interests, the Philippines became its newest gateway to Asia. With Paris holding French Indochina, and London occupying British India and the Malay States, France and the United Kingdom had an advantageous geographical proximity to the biggest treasure chest in Asia: China. Having the Philippine Islands under American leadership afforded Washington an ability to extend its influence and engage in economic activities in the Pacific. American occupation of the Philippines was veiled with the sugar-coated words benevolent assimilation, where Americans bear the responsibility to civilize the savages, thus the concept of the White Man’s burden that even prominent writer Mark Twain openly criticised. Eventually, American exceptionalism and Japanese militarism came into a collision course.
Tokyo’s geopolitical ambitions on the other hand were based on the failures of Qing China in the Opium Wars. In the eyes of the Japanese, modernization, westernization, and reformation were the keys to a strong country which they pursued relentlessly after the Tokugawa Shogunate came to an end. With a burgeoning economy and a population with a rapidly-growing appetite for natural resources, Imperial Japan annexed territories from its immediate neighbors in Qing China, Korea, and Imperial Russia. Deteriorating relations with other major powers didn’t help as Tokyo eyed more territories to carve up for itself, most specially the lush rubber plantations and hydrocarbon fields in modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia through its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What had barred the Japanese military juggernaut in exploiting those resources is the Philippines which housed a significant number of American armed personnel making Manila a necessary capital city to take over.
Foreign powers portrayed their global ambitions on the Philippines, where Manila became the Warsaw of the Orient with the conclusion of the Pacific War. As a way to lessen its load as it became a significant player in global politics, the United States granted official independence to the Philippine Islands, albeit with various economic restrictions that favored American investors and companies. Nevertheless, the Philippines made its official entry in the international theater as a founding member of the League of Nations’ successor, the United Nations. A few decades after 1898, the Philippines became its own nation, its own state.
How did the Philippine Islands become a state? It is because that the Philippines has achieved four requirements that makes a state a state — a permanent population, a defined territory, government, and recognition by other countries. Nevertheless, the Philippines continues to be seen to be a weak, fragile state. Weak states are characterized by dismal government services, inefficient judiciary systems, graft and corruption, internal security issues, massive wealth inequality, and fractionalization. Is this the kind of freedom that is present and enjoyed in the Philippines?
Prominent economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have thoroughly discussed in their book The Narrow Corridor the subject of what genuine freedom is all about. Imagine the slavery institutions of the past. Slave labor has seen a long history in human civilizations, from Ancient Egypt to the Belgian Congo, even in pre-colonial Philippines’ with the aliping saguiguilid and aliping namamahay. What made slavery institutions last was the existential risk of being free. Tracing English philosopher Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan, where man, by nature, is selfish and focused on self-preservation as vital for survival. Despite being at the bottom of the social strata, slaves existed and persisted because a social contract exists that guarantees their survival. Running out free in the wild, away from institutional slavery is a more dangerous option than being tied to owners as slaves, or being tied to land as serfs. That is why despite the victory of the Union against the Confederacy during the American Civil War, black slaves weren’t fully accorded the economic and political opportunities that white Americans enjoyed during that time because their labor through slavery had been thoroughly institutionalized most specially in the plantation-based economies of the Southern states.
According to Acemoglu and Robinson, freedom exists in a narrow corridor where it is safeguarded by a strong state and a strong society. These state and societal institutions should be both formidable and inclusive. In their words, Scandinavian countries, most specially Denmark, demonstrate such strengths. Thus the term “Getting to Denmark” becoming a development benchmark in political science and economics.
A state is considered strong when it possesses the capabilities to take on and carry out responsibilities efficiently and handle internal and external shocks effectively. On the other hand, a strong society is characterized by strong familial or patrimonial ties and an ability to mobilize groups of peoples to forward a cause. There are countless instances in world history where state and society have competed to undermine, weaken, and overpower the other. However, when both powers of the state and society effectively and efficiently check and balance each other, where benefits of having a strong state are reaped without upending the society, a “shackled leviathan” exists. It is in this shackled leviathan where genuine freedom exists.
For the Philippines, having a strong state that doesn’t undermine but instead engages the strong civil society is the most important ingredient to lead the country towards Denmark. This makes sense when linked with then-President Gloria Arroyo’s slogan, Matatag na Republika. However, this is easier said than done as both political order and development have the state as one of its three central pillars. Renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s two-part masterpiece about political order may provide us with better insights in enhancing the powers of the Philippine state, which will be discussed in the second part of this article.",Others
"Leni Robredo: No need to DQ BBM, “we won without a disqualification” in 2016. But did she REALLY?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/leni-robredo-no-need-to-dq-bbm-we-won-without-a-disqualification-in-2016-but-did-she-really/,"If I were Leni Robredo, I wouldn’t be reminding people of what happened back in 2016 when allegations of electoral fraud marred what was supposed to be an “important” national election. In arrogantly proclaiming that she handily beat rival candidate Bongbong Marcos for the vice presidency back then, old wounds have been opened including those to do with the persistent mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Andy Bautista who was Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman at the time.
“Ako, it doesn’t make sense.  Kung gusto namin siya ipa-disqualify dapat sana no’ng laban pa namin ng VP,” Robredo told reporters in a press conference in Negros Occidental on Friday.
“Saka kung ang purpose ng disqualification para maalis siya sa contest na ito, hindi naman kailangan.  Naglaban na kami no’ng 2016, nanalo naman kami na walang ganyan,” she added.
Perhaps it might not have occurred to Robredo that her camp, the Liberal Party (LP), at the time were not as clued in on just how formidable an opponent they were up against — which is why a desperate stunt like disqualifying an opponent (such as what is being attempted today) was not in the cards early in the campaign. Indeed, many observers looked back at how desperation on the part of the Yellowtards kicked in late into the campaign as then candidate Rodrigo Duterte pulled far ahead of LP bet Mar Roxas at the eleventh hour.
With just hours to go and the presidency all but lost to Duterte, Robredo became the Hail Mary Pass that needed to deliver a score for the Yellowtards. Many observers are convinced that the designated wide receiver in those final hours of the election was the then COMELEC chair who, it seems, went on to deliver on his assignment paving the way for Robredo’s self-proclaimed “win”. As the story goes, that successful delivery came at a cost and so now, the mystery persists: Where is Andy Bautista?
Did Robredo know what may have been going on behind the scenes back then? That too is a mystery. Just hours after the shocking statistical improbabilities that accompanied the VP count (a seeming “neck-and-neck race”) were picked up by keen watchers, Robredo joined the rest of her LP ilk in parroting what came across as a prepared script wrought in the midst of what looked like an orchestrated ruling out of any possibility of fraud. Never mind that authorities — presumably led by the COMELEC — are duty-bound to investigate all allegations. Never mind that there was no basis on such short notice to rule out the possibility of fraud. Never mind that Smartmatic personnel implicated in the allegations were mysteriously allowed to leave the Philippines.
Did Leni Robredo actually win the vice presidency in 2016? Is she the Philippines’ rightful VP today? All that remains debatable because the COMELEC had left many questions unresolved, had tainted evidence pertinent to the case, and may have been complicit in allowing Bautista who had, by then, become a person of interest in the case to leave the country. In short, the case remains open today as far as millions of Filipinos are concerned. Robredo may have been proclaimed VP by a Filipino judge, but so have many other top officials under similarly dubious circumstances in the past following unlawful spectacles commonly associated with the Yellowtard “people power” narrative: Cory Aquino proclaimed “president” after the 1986 EDSA coup d’etat, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo after the “EDSA II” lynching of Joseph “Erap” Estrada.
Anything can be made “legal” in the Philippines if a big enough mob of cherry-picked participants gives the thumbs-up and a Philippine judge can be suckered into being an accessory to the fraud that follows.
Aren’t we all glad Leni Robredo is around to remind us of these things?",Others
Ninoy Aquino deserves to have a tent set up in his face,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/ninoy-aquino-deserves-to-have-a-tent-set-up-in-his-face/,"C’mon. You gotta admit, that was funny. This was probably the most ideal spot to set up this tent. Rapplerette Lian Buan “reports”, “The main stage of the Tarlac City Plazuela for the Uniteam event fronts the monument of the late Senator Ninoy Aquino, but he has been covered by a tent so that he is not seen from the stage.”
Understandably, Yellowtards are up in arms making this the subject of their latest outrage fad. The nerve, after all, right? Ninoy Aquino is a “national hero” and deserves respect. Indeed, Yellowtards believe that Ninoy is so entitled to respect that they’ve put up hundreds of statues of him all over the Philippines to ensure that Filipinos do not forget that “fact”.
But what exactly did Ninoy Aquino do to earn him the distinction of being regarded a statue-grade “national hero”? Well, we are constantly told that he died. On that tarmac. In 1983. And that from then on, a “movement” was launched. According to the Yellowtards, dying “for country” is a special skill only people from their camp posses. Never mind that thousands of Filipino soldiers did the same fighting the Yellowtards’  terrorist New People’s Army comrades. No, Ninoy Aquino is the Filipino hero because he “died for the Filipino”.
Well, here is one of Ninoy’s statues today with a tent set up in his face. Thanks for dying for us, dude. By the way, this tent is best set up right here. Thank you, Mr. Aquino.",Others
Bongbong Marcos has pulled the neoliberal narrative rug from under the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/bongbong-marcos-has-pulled-the-neoliberal-narrative-rug-from-under-the-philippine-opposition/,"Filipino neoliberals seem to be obsessed with the victim mindset. In his recent Inquirer column, Randy David describes Americans voting for former President Donald Trump as flirting with one-man rule because of the possibility that Trump might win again in 2024. “This,” David writes to punctuate his point, “is how dictatorships are born—often on the back of a popular vote.”
The former president is outpolling all his rivals, so much that even if the latter united behind one of them, their combined votes would not come close to denting Trump’s dominance. At the national level, Joe Biden’s approval ratings have been abysmal. Between him and Trump, the votes are evenly split, signifying a deep politico-cultural divide within the American polity itself.
American media has long hidden the truth about the divide between north and south, which was the cause of the civil war and the fact that, up to today, racial discrimination still exists in American society. Then there’s the military-industrial complex which has been tagged as being behind the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. For years, we were led to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman despite the Zapruder footage showing Kennedy was successively shot twice; the first hitting him at the throat and the second, at the back of his head. No trained marksman can get off two shots that quick with the target on a moving vehicle.
It was easy to brainwash people then into believing America stood for good while the rest of the despots in the world were evil. There is conclusive proof that most of the wars, after the last two great wars, were American-instigated. This is substantiation that America’s divisive wounds never completely healed after the civil war. Conservative Americans constitute the bulk of its military. Recruitment sources the warm bodies from the youth of the Midwest and the South, the two regions far removed from the glamour and sophistication of the major cities on the West and East Coast.
The 2020 election was tumultuous to say the least. America is financing another war right after it pulled out of Afghanistan. It suffered the fate of other hegemons which tried to subjugate the Afghans. Miserable failure. The last American military victory was its defense of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Its latest incursion in the Middle East since 2001 ended in defeat. The world isn’t a better place with American hegemony as it continues to pressure Russia and China to bend to its will.
What’s funny about national democratic Filipinos like David is their penchant for siding with hegemons in the defense of democracy. Trump isn’t a communist but is branded as a potential dictator. How for god’s sake? What David and the rest of the neoliberals across the world are afraid of is the rise of conservatism and rightist tendencies in Europe and other countries. David has nothing to fear in the Philippines because Marcos is adhering to the dictum of the “rights based international order.” They won’t get what they exactly want but their American and European principals will have to live with it because they need a lackey in the region and that is us with the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).
The opposition’s conundrum is President Bongbong Marcos has co-opted their agenda which leaves them scratching their heads because he has adopted their cause as his own. Subliminally maybe this is what David is referring to. Look at the leftist-militants being virulently anti-China but also being anti-Marcos. It doesn’t compute given the current alliances. I don’t think the opposition can get its head out of its ass for the 2025 and 2028 election. Maybe it’s only a matter of time before they go extinct.",Others
Foreign policy must never be dictated by emotions,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/foreign-policy-must-never-be-dictated-by-emotions/,"Tensions are rising between the Philippines and China, as activities in the West Philippine Sea are continuously being monitored, not only by their respective governments, but also by various countries who have tactical and strategic interests in these waters. From the recent water cannon incident which harassed fellow Filipinos, to beating the Chinese national basketball team in the recently held Asian Games, Filipino-Chinese relations are always being featured in various media outlets. Numerous individuals and groups are quick in pointing out Beijing’s bellicose actions, stirring national emotions further. Beating the drums of nationalism leads the country to take a jingoist stance. To make matters worse, politicians are willing to ride on this dangerous sentiment that is felt by these ordinary citizens. What are these politicians thinking about, and is it practical in protecting, promoting, and projecting our national interests?
To build international pressure against aggressive Chinese tactics in these contested waters, senators would say that the West Philippine Sea dilemma should be raised through the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). This proposition supported by some intellectuals provide the United States-Nicaragua issue as a concrete example. However, this is erroneous because it fails to recognize two distinct factors that separate these issues from each other, which are the differences between the internal socio-political structures of the United States and China, and the plausibility of gaining a significant number of favorable votes in the UNGA.
There are stark, polarizing differences in the current socio-political structures between the United States and China. The former is a representative democracy, where regular elections are held and elected leaders reflect the sentiments of their constituents, while the latter follows autocratic communism. Unlike Washington where the power to govern is derived from its people, Beijing derives its power from the Chinese Communist Party, which reflects its position as an entity above its own constitution. Unlike modern liberal democracies, Chinese constituents legitimize its government only if it brings order and prosperity, which is uncannily similar with how the dynastic mandate of heaven operated. Thus, popular public opinion holds more weight in both domestic and foreign policies in Washington than in Beijing. With polarizing politics affecting both the Democrats and the Republicans, the United States faces a herculean task in finding the balance between political will and political concessions. This American political setting seems completely incongruent with the Chinese, where its perennially strong state institutions are willing to exert its authority in the name of national interest.
Regarding the UNGA, passing resolutions in this multilateral organization is a numbers game, similar with how Philippine elections work. No matter how strong one’s case is in both legal and moral aspects, UN member countries have the tendency to favor what vote brings them greater benefits. Unlike Beijing, Manila is only a middle power and cannot easily influence the decisions of other countries. Taking a look at the Philippine diplomatic footprint in Africa is a tell-tale story of an uphill battle. Currently, the Philippines has embassies in Rabat, Johannesburg, Nairobi, Tripoli, Cairo, and Abuja, while China has diplomatic missions in all African capital cities, albeit for Eswatini. With Africa holding 55 votes in the UNGA and China having 54 embassies and 7 consulates in that continent, the Philippines has virtually zero assurance in winning the numbers game. In addition, Africa has historical relations with China, where Chinese admiral Zheng He has ventured  to East Africa during the Ming dynasty. In the economic front, does Manila even have a program that comes close in confronting Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)?
Unfortunately, many Filipinos and politicians seem unwilling to bridge the gap between what’s ideal from what’s practical, where they would rather point fingers at China instead of recalibrating its position. The West Philippine Sea issue has been continuing for more than five decades, and its peaceful and amicable resolution seems to be lightyears away. In addition, weak Philippine state institutions make Manila subservient to American pressure, where it doesn’t help in formulating pragmatic solutions. Washington’s intervention in Philippine affairs complicates the pursuance of an independent foreign policy, which is a constitutional mandate. American brands of exceptionalism and idealism is not applicable for this increasingly multipolar world order. On the other hand, despite its century-old historical grievances against China, a different Asian country is forging its own path. Enter India.
India, the crown jewel of British imperialism, became an independent nation-state in 1947. After being siphoned of its resources by the United Kingdom for nearly a century, it became a country renowned for its dehumanizing poverty. Starvation, political instability, and economic mismanagement was an everyday occurrence, where Great Britain continued harassing and abusing the Indian subcontinent. These internal weaknesses did not stop the Indian civilization from adopting a prudent foreign policy through then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which serves as the main blueprint framing China-India relations. These contentious territorial disputes in Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh, and Kashmir separates New Delhi and Beijing, served as stern reminders for their leaders not to depend on external powers in defending themselves. Indian foreign policy is firmly grounded on Indian realpolitik for numerous decades, where New Delhi refused to align itself with larger and more influential powers. During the Cold War, India military hardware was primarily based on Soviet technology and adopted Russian manufactured arms. However, with the current geopolitical dynamics, New Delhi is beginning to adopt western technologies from Washington and Paris. These can be observed with their Brahmos missiles and Tejas jet fighters, where parts of these respective technologies can be derived from both Russia and the United States, respectively. But what significantly changed the power calculations regarding India was the Smiling Buddha, making India the first non-permanent member-state of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that conducted a successful nuclear bomb test.
In the diplomatic front, India is making its presence felt by maintaining its cordial relations with Tehran, Riyadh, and Moscow, while building bridges with Paris, Washington, and Canberra. Considering India’s cognizance of its national interests, it understood that India will play an integral role in shaping the new world order. Despite of their territorial disputes with Beijing, New Delhi’s avenues for conducting dialogue are always present in various multilateral organizations through BRICS, G-20, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). India also makes its presence felt in the UN, where they continuously participate and sends boots on the ground through its peace-keeping missions.
India is making significant strides in the fronts of economics and politics. Presently, New Delhi purchases affordable hydrocarbons from Moscow, fueling its economic growth. Economic reforms by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have significantly liberalized its economy, cutting bureaucratic red tape that made it an economically irrelevant country during the Cold War years. With the promotion of the “Make in India” campaign, and paired with its youthful and gigantic population, New Delhi is poised to overtake Tokyo and Berlin as the third largest economy in 10 years.
The enviable position of India was not built in one night. It was created with a strong understanding of its national interests and its continuous attempts in internally reforming the political, economic, and social structures of their country. Instead of blaming China for their bellicose actions near their borders, Indians sought to strengthen themselves, and eventually stand toe to toe with the Chinese, while ensuring that opportunities for diplomacy are always present through their multilateral organizations. Unfortunately, Manila would rather point fingers at Beijing’s aggressive actions, without reflecting that the Philippines direly needs to reform its political and economic institutions for these incursions to stop. Unless Filipinos feel mortified on how pathetic and feeble the country’s political and economic state is, Chinese aggressions are here to stay.",Others

After Manila allowed the US to increase its military bases all over the country, it is now in the middle of a geopolitical tinderbox.
With the U.S. stationing its NUCLEAR-capable Typhon missile system in the Philippines, and a Russian attack submarine recently spotted lurking in the West Philippine Sea and China testing more intercontinental missiles that flies over the Philippines in response to US military expansion in Southeast Asia.
While allies like Japan and Australia claim to support the Philippines the rest of ASEAN is keeping its distance, sticking to a neutral stance in the escalating U.S.-China showdown. So, where does this leave us?
U.S. Typhon Missile System: A Deadly Presence
Earlier this year, the U.S. deployed its nuclear-capable Typhon missile system in Northern Luzon as part of joint military exercises. Military officials initially said the missiles were only in the country on a temporary basis but here’s the kicker: the system now has no plans of leaving. DND Secretary Teodoro even asserted the country’s right to acquire the missile system, which would give the Philippines the capability to hit targets inside China, including Taiwan.
Capable of carrying nuclear warheads and firing precision-guided missiles like the Tomahawk, this isn’t just a defense tool; it’s a game-changer in regional military balance. The U.S. claims it’s to strengthen the Philippines’ defenses, but let’s be real—this puts us squarely in China’s cross hairs.
China’s reaction? Furious. Beijing has accused the Philippines and the U.S. of destabilizing the region. And they’re not bluffing— just last September, China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, flying over the northern point of the Philippines in what is reported to be the first such test since the 1980s. Are we ready to handle the fallout if China decides to play hardball?

If hosting advanced U.S. missiles wasn’t enough, last week brought another jaw-dropping moment: a Russian attack submarine was detected within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. The submarine was found just 80 nautical miles off Mindoro. President Marcos called the incident “very worrisome,” and honestly, he’s not wrong. Unauthorized foreign military activity in our waters raises a terrifying question: are we becoming a battleground for global powers?
Ukraine saw the worst of being a proxy in the US-Russia with over 500,000 dead and counting.
Dangerously Provoking the Superpowers
Let’s talk about money—because this isn’t just about security; it’s about survival. China is our biggest trading partner and neighbor, with billions of pesos worth of goods flowing between us. But by aligning closely with the Washington, we risk alienating Beijing.
What if China slaps us with sanctions, cuts back on trade and investments or ignores the Philippines all together in its regional economic plans? That’s a direct hit to Filipino job seekers, consumers and businessmen.
And let’s not forget: military alliances cost money. Acquiring advanced weapons and hosting U.S. troops means pouring billions into defense, potentially at the expense of social services. Can we afford this gamble?
Is the Philippines Losing ASEAN’s Trust?
While we’re cozying up to the U.S., our ASEAN neighbors are keeping things cool. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia are refusing to take sides, focusing on economic growth and peace. By openly following the US military alliance, we risk losing our influence in ASEAN, a bloc that’s crucial for regional stability and economic growth. Are we okay with being seen as the pariah in the region?
The Philippines is playing a dangerous game. Hosting U.S. missiles, dealing with Russian attack submarines and China’s ICBM might look like power moves, but they come with risks that could hit Filipinos where it hurts—our economy, our sovereignty, and our regional relationships.
So, where do we go from here? Do we double down on our alliance with the U.S. and hope for the best, or do we step back and reassess before the storm hits? One thing’s for sure: the stakes have never been higher, and the consequences could shape our future for generations. Are we ready for what’s coming?",Others
The idiotic “EDSA people power” frame Filipino thought leaders apply to analysing world events,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/the-idiotic-edsa-people-power-frame-filipino-thought-leaders-apply-to-analysing-world-events/,"Filipino thought leaders always jump at every opportunity to apply their favorite “people power” frame to personal thoughts on current events that they share. Inquirer columnist Randy David, for one, still believes in people power and expounds on this in his piece “South Korea’s ‘Edsa Tres’ moment” where he highlights a key insight…
South Korea’s current political crisis bears echoes of these Philippine episodes but diverges in significant ways. Where the Philippines often turned to mass mobilizations to decide outcomes, South Korea’s institutions—the National Assembly, Constitutional Court, and CIO—are at the forefront. And, so far, the military leadership has not shown any sign that it is about to take sides or intervene. This institutional approach may have its limitations, but it underscores the value of giving legal and procedural norms and processes a chance to work, even amid political turmoil.
David doesn’t want to admit that what the Yellowidiots refer to as Edsa 1 and 2 were nothing more than successful coup attempts. This is why I wonder why the moron anchors of SMNI, the media organisation loyal to former President Rodrigo Duterte, call for protests at the People Power shrine when Duterte largely downplayed EDSA people power celebrations because of their divisiveness.
Any move to oust the present administration is not and will not be people power. It will be a coup d’etat. This is the main defect of our political system which is why I still believe that a parliamentary system of government is best for the Philippines as it is the norm in the region also. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister can be ousted by a no-confidence vote, which triggers new elections, or the selection of a replacement among the ranks of current members of parliament. Our system doesn’t allow this and we’re stuck with a president who can continue to do more harm as he finishes his six years term.
The other challenge in our case is the fact that our lawmakers are bereft of honesty and integrity. They are easily bought off. The South Korean mindset, as explained by someone who deals with them on a regular basis, is to act with a sense of urgency. This is why they were able to mobilize quickly in Seoul to protest against the actions of the president and pressure the military into submission.
In short, patriotism is fervent in South Korea while in our case, it’s the bare minimum and only expressed on social media. Kamote pa rin tayo.",Others
Sara Duterte IMPEACHED! Her father saw it coming back in 2019…,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/sara-duterte-impeached-her-father-saw-it-coming-back-in-2019/,"Then President Rodrigo Duterte’s warning way back in 2019 has now become reality with the impeachment of his daughter, current Vice President Inday Sara Duterte.
Duterte on Monday warned Sara that the presidency will destroy her amid rumors she is positioning herself as his potential successor in 2022. He slammed “paid hacks” and “hyenas” in the media, some of whom have come up with critical reports of his wealth and policies including the war on drugs.
Because of Inday’s intransigence, they’re now in the middle of the battle of their political lives. As the presidency is a matter of destiny, the same can also be said about one’s family. The late former President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. (FEM) betrayed the former president’s father Vicente Duterte in 1967. Duterte, as such, never trusted current President Bongbong Marcos (BBM). It was really the latter’s sister, Senator Imee Marcos-Manotoc was was the conduit during the 2016 campaign.
Duterte paid his political debt with FEM’s burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. He never appointed BBM to a government post, he didn’t interfere in the electoral protest against Leni Robredo over the course of her vice presidency during his term as president and he also told his political allies to stop trying to impeach her because political stability was more important to him than being vengeful towards a political enemy.
The Yellowidiots, the Reds and the loyalists are all gloating now that Inday has been impeached. Inday was used as the stepping stone to the presidency and now she’s the doormat for the Marcos presidency.
We can now only wait for what the fates has in store for the protagonists.
But more importantly, we must realize by now who the real enemies are. If there is to be any hope for the country, these enemies should be put down and every effort should be exerted that they atay dead and be unable to make any political comeback.

The Philippines: An American Vassal Again?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/10/the-philippines-an-american-vassal-again/,"In recent years, several alarming developments have unfolded, placing the Philippines once again in the crosshairs of superpower politics. The country’s historic ties with the United States have often been characterized by a complicated blend of dependency, cooperation, and coercion. Today, this dynamic raises urgent concerns as the Philippines becomes increasingly entangled in the geopolitical military designs of its former colonial master.
Three contentious issues stand at the forefront: the reported deployment of the U.S.-developed Volt Typhoon spyware within allied nations, including the Philippines; the U.S.’s controversial plan to process Afghan refugees on Philippine soil before they are relocated to the U.S.; and the reinvigorated use of Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites, which are purportedly for humanitarian purposes but increasingly appear aimed at containing China’s rise in the region.
These developments suggest that the Philippines may once again be serving as a pawn in American power struggles rather than exercising full autonomy in its foreign policy.
The Volt Typhoon Spyware: The Digital Trojan Horse
The Volt Typhoon spyware, developed by the U.S. for cyber surveillance and espionage, has allegedly been deployed in various allied nations, including the philippines. This sophisticated software is more than a simple tool for monitoring; it functions as a digital Trojan horse that can infiltrate networks, steal sensitive data, and compromise national security. For a country like the Philippines, still developing its cyber defense infrastructure, the implications are particularly troubling.
The U.S. has a history of surveillance practices even on its closest allies. In 2023, a leaked Pentagon report revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies had spied on Ukraine and other partners amid the conflict with Russia. Previously, reports from Danish intelligence showed that the U.S. had also spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top European officials by using Danish internet cables. Such actions demonstrate a pattern of overreach by the U.S., raising questions about the true purpose of Volt Typhoon in the Philippines.
Though the U.S. frames Volt Typhoon as a tool to protect its allies from cyberattacks, its capabilities allow for extensive espionage—not just against external threats but also against the very governments it is supposedly designed to protect. For the Philippines, this raises several disturbing questions: Why should we trust a foreign power to protect us while placing our digital sovereignty at risk? How much of our government’s sensitive information has already been exposed? More critically, is the Philippines merely a convenient cyber battleground in America’s broader Cold War against China?
Instead of relying on foreign technology, shouldn’t we invest in our own cyber defense systems? By maintaining our digital sovereignty, we can avoid becoming just another pawn in America’s global chess game.
Afghan Refugees: An American-Created Problem, a Filipino Burden
Another issue raising eyebrows is the decision to temporarily house Afghan refugees in the Philippines while they await processing for relocation to the U.S. This plan, initiated in the wake of the U.S.’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, has led to concerns over national security, sovereignty, and the real motivations behind this policy.
The Initial reports claiming these individuals were “refugees” were later corrected, revealing that they are former Afghan employees who worked for the U.S. military during its occupation of Afghanistan. With the U.S. possessing vast land and resources, why offload this responsibility onto a developing nation like the Philippines?
The lack of transparency from both the Philippine and American governments has only deepened public suspicion. What are the long-term implications for the Philippines? Hosting refugees, particularly from a conflict zone as volatile as Afghanistan, introduces risks—ranging from potential security threats to strain on local infrastructure. Moreover, what happens if the U.S. decides to change its plans? Will the refugees be stuck in the Philippines indefinitely? Will this become a precedent, setting an expectation for future interventions where the Philippines is expected to “clean up” America’s messes?
Time and again, the U.S. has made decisions that affect the Philippines without consulting or prioritizing the welfare of the Filipino people. We must ask ourselves: are we truly an equal partner, or just a convenient dumping ground?
Dangers of EDCA Bases
The expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites across the Philippines has turned the nation into a potential target within the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific strategy. While these bases are presented as hubs for disaster relief and humanitarian missions, they are located in strategic areas, particularly close to Taiwan and the South China Sea.
There are growing concerns that these bases could host U.S. military systems, including missiles, which might be perceived as a threat by adversarial nations. Reports have already indicated that the Philippines could be caught in the nuclear crosshairs of Russia, as Philippine cooperation with the U.S. raises alarm among rival powers. This alignment heightens the risks, effectively turning the Philippines into a satellite state for U.S. interests and putting the country on the front line of potential conflict between superpowers.
With tensions rising between the U.S. and China, the Philippines finds itself, once again, at the heart of a potential conflict between giants. The Filipino people must ask: Is this alliance beneficial, or are we risking too much for a partnership that prioritizes U.S. interests over our own?
The Struggle for Genuine Sovereignty
The common thread linking these issues is the Philippines’ subservient role in America’s global strategy. Whether it’s the deployment of Volt Typhoon spyware, the processing of Afghan refugees, or the strategic use of EDCA bases, the Philippines is repeatedly positioned as a tool for American interests rather than an independent nation with its own priorities.
Who truly benefits from this arrangement? Is it the Filipino people, or the American military-industrial complex? Is our government acting in the interests of its citizens, or simply following Washington’s lead?
The Philippines has a long, complex history with the United States, but this relationship must evolve. We must assert our independence and prioritize our own national interests. By investing in our own cyber defense infrastructure, crafting a foreign policy that reflects Filipino values, and developing a defense strategy that doesn’t rely on foreign powers, the Philippines can finally move toward genuine sovereignty.
The Filipino people deserve more than to be pawns in another nation’s agenda. It’s time for real independence from hegemons who act for their interests alone.",Others
Necropolitics is the strategy of last resort for the Duterte camp,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/necropolitics-is-the-strategy-of-last-resort-for-the-duterte-camp/,"The popularity argument is being worn thin by the Duterte camp. It is devilishly difficult to gauge public sentiment more so considering there is a multitude of competing “survey” firms that claim to be “scientific” and “unbiased” in their methods of getting a reading on public opinion.
It seems political and “thought” leaders as well as pedestrian observers have not learnt much from the sketchy reliability of displays of popularity in the past. The catastrophic defeat of Leni Robredo in the 2022 elections is one case in point. Displays of solidarity in massive rallies backed by the chi chi clique of the private school set and their Catholic schools together with the amplification services of mainstream media all failed to deliver her that “important” presidency. Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency of the United States is the most recent example of a similarly incompetent appraisal of public sentiment by inbred liberal thinking.
Perhaps then it is worth considering that supporters of embattled former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte could be barking up the wrong tree. Images of sporadic mass protests in his support bubbling up in the Philippines and abroad being shared across social media may lead one to believe that there could be a pathway to Duterte’s getting out of the bind he is in. However, this all seems akin to the same situation in the South China Sea where Filipinos too had dropped the ball. Once you’ve been tricked into ceding territory to the enemy, it is very difficult to get it back. The government of current President Bongbong Marcos was very clinical in its (practically literal) execution throwing out a pain-in-the-ass political rival over the fence and into the hands of a foreign “court” hungry for validation.
Duterte may not come back alive but his coming back dead could be that silver lining his “die-hard” (DDS) supporters are scrounging around for. One must not discount the power of necropolitics. This is, after all, a country with a state religion that uses a dead man hanging off a cross as its rallying icon.
We have, after all, no less than almost half a century of contemporary Philippine history to look back to for lessons — from the time the bloodied body of the late former senator Ninoy Aquino was paraded through Manila’s streets for political gain, the rise of the Second Aquino presidency on the back of Cory nostalgia, to the body of the late “dictator” kept in cryo over the course of his journey to a hero’s burial. That’s not to mention the National Hero himself Jose Rizal who was written into Philippine history books on the back of his “martyrdom” in the hands of Filipinos’ then colonial masters.
At this stage, now that his camp have all but dropped the ball, former President Rodrigo Duterte is more valuable dead. While alive, his political capital and that of his camp will progressively be eroded as the trial in The Hague drags on and more of the details of his alleged “genocide” is used as fodder by the Yellowtard-Communist Axis and their European chums.",Others
Duterte’s cleanup of the mess Noynoy Aquino made of Ph-China relations should CONTINUE post 2022,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/dutertes-cleanup-of-the-mess-noynoy-aquino-made-of-ph-china-relations-should-continue-post-2022/,"The problem with the Opposition is they keep on making false claims. Joel Ruiz Butuyan, in his Inquirer piece “China and our next president”, writes; “We need to know what every candidate intends to do with the international Arbitral Award that our country won against China. Will our candidate continue the path of the Duterte administration in setting aside the award, or will he or she choose an entirely different path?” Butuyan’s position, as expected, is one of fear of that continuity that his camp are bent on blocking…
The Duterte administration has either closed its eyes or has played along with China’s insistence on a diplomatic solution, even when China has forcibly occupied or imposed control on an area over which we have exclusive rights. Even when our fishermen have repeatedly complained of China’s bullying maneuvers, our government has chosen to sweep the complaints under the rug, repeatedly touting instead the supposed benefits we gain from Chinese loans and investments.
One only need recall our earlier article detailing discussions Antonio Trillanes had with a group of Ateneo professors about what really happened during the Scarborough standoff. There was a glaring disconnect about the Presidential proclamation for the West Philippine Sea signed by then President Aquino. If there is a West, shouldn’t there be an East as well? China has the East China and South China Seas clearly defined in maps. The real story could not have been more different to Butuyan’s preferred narrative…
Duterte has done away with his predecessor’s belligerent policy towards the regional military and economic giant that is China. His policy of rapprochement has led to warmer ties and a de-escalation of the tension-filled relations during the administration for former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III when there was a travel ban in place and Philippine banana exports were subject to quarantine before being allowed entry. This was the offshoot of the Luneta hostage-taking incident over which Aquino refused to apologise to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Worse, Aquino also did not speak on the telephone to Donald Tsang, which added insult to the injury and death of the Chinese nationals who were taken hostage.
Butuyan is also either misinformed or lying when he writes; “About the same time that China was intimidating our poor fishermen, we experienced shortages in our country’s supply of galunggong and we began importing the fish from China.” The importation of frozen fish products began as early as the 90s. As a marine products trader, I pioneered the sale of Dole Seafood round scad or galunggong export rejects in the mid-90s. Round scad was caught in volume by fishing companies based in General Santos. The good size and quality were exported to Japan for use as bait of the long-line tuna boats the Japanese deployed to fish for tuna in the Pacific Ocean. There was also the mackerel caught by Taiwanese clipper boats which had onboard processing and freezing equipment imported by the Navotas and Malabon fishing magnates. Our lack of supply stems from the non-development of our fishing industry and the lack of post-catch facilities in the region along with poor supply chain and logistics infrastructure.
It’s been also made clear by no less former Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban that enforcement of the arbitral award is a tedious process. We are better off negotiating with China bilaterally. He also misrepresents Sen. Ping Lacson’s statement about his stand on foreign policy if ever he wins the Presidency writing that he plans to “align ourselves with foreign powers who share our interest in stopping China’s aggression”. Lacson made it clear during his participation in the Kamuning Bakery’s Pandesal Forum that he would continue with the independent foreign policy as defined in the Constitution. He didn’t mention alignment with country’s which can help enforce the arbitral ruling.
Butuyan doesn’t even bring up the more serious implications of the Quad alliance in relation to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its major trading partners made up of China, Japan and South Korea. Butuyan is making it a Philippines-versus-China issue when it is not that simple. As it is, Joe Biden has been taking a beating on US foreign policy as well. Just last week, the State Department was caught off-guard by his categorical statement that the US would defend Taiwan in case China made moves to take back what it considers a renegade province. The US still has to recover its foreign policy bearings after Afghanistan, which again is on the brink of collapse. Butuyan is just trying to rouse public opinion in favor of Leni Robredo who can’t even pronounce sovereignty correctly.",Others
Economies of the Philippines and Russia share a common denominator,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/economies-of-the-philippines-and-russia-share-a-common-denominator/,"With the Kremlin’s aggressive actions in addressing their grievances regarding Ukraine, numerous countries slapped sanctions against Russia. These economic sanctions imposed on Moscow are complex, where portions of the Russian economy in the sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, and services are being castigated. In addition, the aforementioned sanctions don’t only come from other foreign governments, but also from various multinational companies that do business in and out of Russia. Popular brands like Volkswagen, Panasonic, Amazon, Hermes, and Google applied sanctions due to Kremlin’s bellicose actions. Even McDonalds had closed their restaurants, further isolating Russia from the modern, globalized world.
However, one of the things that must be examined meticulously are the sanctions targeting these Russian oligarchs. These billionaires are known to possess deep pockets and have secure bank accounts in several countries. Their families usually live frivolous lifestyles and before the Ukrainian crisis started to unfold, resided in fancy condominiums located in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and in the British Isles. It’s no wonder the term “Londongrad” had been a buzzword for the past few years — a portmanteau defining super-rich Russian families transferring and utilizing their financial wealth in the United Kingdom.
These Russian oligarchs can be classified into two groups: the Yeltsin-era oligarchs and the Putin-era oligarchs. Even though these wealthy Russians amassed fortunes vis-à-vis their relationship with the Kremlin, they completely differ in how they obtained such an absurd amount of wealth. Yeltsin-era oligarchs became rich when President Boris Yeltsin decided to liquidate then-Soviet assets anc were being sold in the market. Fearing that non-Russians would actively participate in the acquisition of these assets, they were awarded instead to these Russian nationals in a questionable manner. On the other hand, Putin-era oligarchs raked in profits through government-issued projects and contracts, which would include business dealings related with the importation and exportation of various commodities. The stark differences of these two kinds of oligarchs can also be better understood when looking through Russian economic history.
The economic history of Russia can be summarized as a cycle composed of four distinct parts; are implosion, rebirth, progress, stagnation, and a return to implosion as it completes the whole cycle. The last years of the Romanovs saw the decline of the Russian empire’s political economy, where the civil war pitted the Bolsheviks against the White Russians, with the former emerging victorious. This internal implosion that wreaked Slavic societies led to the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), where Moscow held a virtual monopoly over political power and utilized such powers for a planned, centralized economy. With Josef Stalin’s five-year plans, the Soviet Union aimed to industrialize the country with increased productivity and were able to achieve most of those objectives. Soviet industrial might coupled with its massive manpower were able to thwart Nazi Germany’s militaristic ambitions, and this upward trajectory continued until the Khrushchev years. During the 1960’s, numerical estimates project that the Soviets would overtake the United States and its allies by the 1980’s. However, inefficiency, corruption, and bureaucracy created a stagnating environment in the Soviet Union, which later led to the disintegration of the immensely powerful communist state. This dissolution was later followed by the restructuring of the Russian political economy, specially with the birth of Yeltsin-era oligarchs. With massive hydrocarbon reserves and an increasing demand for natural gas, the economy of Russia grew tremendously in the new millennium, which in turn created these Putin-era oligarchs.
These generations of Russian political and economic elites enriched themselves primarily through resource extraction. Aside from fossil fuels, logging and mining industries in Russia have also generated profits as the global market was always hungry for these limited resources. To protect themselves from competition, these oligarchs prey on other potential business players, further implanting themselves in a dominant position in terms of market share. These extractive economic institutions observed in Russia definitely bear an uncanny resemblance in the context of Philippine colonial history.
During the colonial period, the Spaniards administered their overseas territories through an “encomienda” system, which were also used extensively in Latin America. With the Spanish unfamiliar with the geography and population of their constituents, delegating these tasks to the more collusive locals was a more cost-effective approach. As long as the colony had access to labor and money through tributes, permanent Spanish settlements have their assurances. Systems including the “polo y servicios” were methods of extracting human and monetary resources from the country. These Spanish period approaches in abusing Filipinos created generations of landed elites in the country, possessing hundreds or thousands of hectares of agricultural plantations called as “haciendas“. These landed elites later colluded with the Americans to administer the Philippine archipelago, perpetuating themselves with the lands that they have never toiled upon.
Looking at these non-inclusive economic institutions, it becomes clear why Russia and the Philippines ranked in the top five with significant percentages of wealth generated through crony capitalism, according to the Economist. Also known as clique mercantilism, this select group amassed unfathomable amounts of capital and can make or break a politician’s political career. Prior to the Pacific War, both Japan and the United States faced bitter confrontations against the Japanese “zaibatsu” and American robber barons. The likes of Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi dominated Imperial Japan, while John Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and many more became the faces of American capitalism. Even though these “zaibatsu” and robber barons helped in industrializing their respective countries and created a degree of liquidity in their economies, their attempts to hinder creative destruction and competition were noticeable whenever the opportunity presents itself. However, the Second World War was the critical juncture that also greatly affected these oligarchic institutions.
Philippine oligarchs and the landed gentry continue to benefit greatly in crony capitalism. While they are hiding behind these diversified companies that engage in various sectors of the economy, they have been cushioned from foreign competition due to the 1987 Constitution’s protectionist stance. This results to a dismal quality of services provided to the consumers, due to the sheer absence of competing companies trying to carve up their respective market shares. The state of Philippine telecommunications serve as its best or probably, worst example.
Leftists groups denounce such realities, but provide responses that includes massively taxing the wealthy and socializing the means of production. However, all these methods enlarge the powers of the government and leads a nation-state vulnerable to tyranny, which is exactly similar to the cycles of what Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation had experienced. Such responses would only exacerbate social discontent and fuel civil disobedience.
Renowned economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their books, Why Nations Fail and The Narrow Corridor, point out that enfranchising participants in the free market economy through various incentives is the way to prosperity. A government should prudently exercise its powers by enforcing fair competition, respecting property rights, and maintaining the rule of law. Creating and preserving inclusive political and economic institutions, coupled with a correct balance between the powers of the state and the society is the ideal approach to escaping oligarchy. However, it still seems that the Philippines is still pretty distant from achieving such a milestone.",Others
Should the Philippines host Afghan refugees?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/should-the-philippines-host-afghan-refugees/,"Roughly a year ago, the United States withdrew their military assets and personnel from Afghanistan as Taliban forces were gained more and more territories. As Afghans rushed to the airport to catch the last airplane departing Kabul, videos and images of people latching themselves onto to this jet in a final yet desperate futile attempt at leaving Afghanistan flooded social media. Washington’s international standing took a deep nosedive as American politicians and bureaucrats found that they had bitten off more than what they can chew. Now, they are requesting Manila to allow these Afghan refugees into Philippine territory — an issue that now divides Filipinos. Some individuals cited humanitarian reasons in allowing these refugees entry to Philippines. On the other hand, some people vehemently oppose such an arrangement because these refugees can become threats to national security. Looking at these points, we now ask: What is the most pragmatic and practical stance for the Philippines?
Afghanistan is a predominantly Islamic, land-locked country known for its mountainous yet barren topography. With geographical features that seem unsuitable for large-scale agriculture except for opium cultivation, nomadic pastoral groups like the Pashtuns moved together with their flock in search of food and water. This arid territory had bordered notable civilizations including the Indians, Persians, Russians, and the Chinese. Geopolitically, Afghanistan served as a buffer zone between the imperial expansionists of Moscow and London during their “Great Game” rivalry in the 19th century. With the Allies emerging victorious in the Second World War and London eventually granting independence to their most profitable colony, the Soviets exercised significant influence over the region as Kabul aligned itself more towards Moscow.
Hostilities during the Cold War also rocked Afghanistan. The fall of Saigon in 1975 sealed the fate of America’s military intervention in Vietnam. Washington’s embarrassing defeat inadvertently emboldened Soviet militaristic desires and the Soviet Union attacked Afghanistan and hijacked its political institutions. Despite their ideological differences, the Reagan administration supported mujahidin groups that embraced Islamic fundamentalism. Realpolitik called for supporting groups who confront and combat communist hegemony, which was in accordance to America’s containment policy at the time. Moscow’s internal struggles for power, paired with economic and political tribulations, led to the withdrawal of Soviet military forces which came to be regarded as eerily similar with how Viet Cong forces humbled the mighty Americans. This paved the way for these mujahids to take Kabul and establish their own monopoly of violence in Afghanistan.
As the world order became unipolar under American leadership, the September 11, 2001 attacks sent shockwaves across the globe. Osama bin Laden and his radicalized Islamic militant group Al Qaeda orchestrated these attacks and were being hosted by the Taliban. The Americans wanted vengeance and took justice into their own hands. They requested Kabul to surrender the aforementioned group to Washington. With the Taliban denying that request, a justifiable casus belli led the United States to put boots to the ground. Together with its allies, military forces of the United States invaded Afghanistan. Despite the war beginning during the Bush Jr. administration, it was the Obama administration that executed and witnessed the military operation that terminated Osama bin Laden.
With mounting grievances and war weariness sinking in American society, Washington’s attempt at nation-building in Afghanistan was a failure as no clear objectives were put in place. Ideally, military interventions should be swift and goal-oriented so as to control collateral damage and unwanted additional expenses. However, twenty years of propping up an American-backed Afghanistan reflected how feeble its state institutions were. Washington squandering its resources on the Afghan quagmire for two decades created three undesirable beneficiaries, none of which mirror American interests. The first beneficiary is China and Russia, because American military presence helped their own national security vis-à-vis Islamic terrorism. The second beneficiary would be the corrupt Afghan politicians who funneled foreign cash directly to their own pockets. The last beneficiary is the military-industrial-congressional complex of the United States as they are incentivized to act belligerently in selling armed conflict.
Currently, the Taliban leadership continues to sow fear and sorrow to their peoples. Islamic fundamentalism is returning, where women and girls are robbed of their basic rights such as education and recreation and deemed second class citizens. Brutal and inhumane means of oppression force Afghans to leave their own country, and the United States have officially requested the Philippines to host these individuals. Should Manila do it?
The Philippines has a long history of hosting refugees during international exigencies. During the Second World War, a number of Jews who experienced persecution in Nazi Germany were admitted by then-President Manuel Quezon. During the 1970’s, the Marcos Sr administration hosted thousands of Vietnamese refugees, while then-President Rodrigo Duterte was open to admitting some Rohingya migrants fleeing Myanmar. All these presidents cited humanitarian reasons in letting these refugees stay in the Philippines.
Needless to say, hosting refugees entails various factors that lie beyond humanitarianism as they should be eventually integrated and assimilated into the receiving country. Integration is a process where refugees would experience social inclusion and economic mobility, where their skills and talents would be properly utilized in the receiving country’s respective labor market and economy. On the other hand, assimilation is where migrants would adopt the local culture and become part of that country’s social fabric. Unfortunately, many developed countries are experiencing various issues integrating and assimilating migrants. Germany for its part, had been relatively welcoming of Syrian migrants during Angela Merkel’s term as chancellor. However, societal clashes in terms of culture and religion made integration a difficult subject because it involves taxpayers’ money spent on welfare programs. Home-grown terrorism in France is also a social issue as these migrant families and their offspring failed to assimilate in French society. This can also be observed in Great Britain where a number of British nationals sympathetic to the ISIS cause left the United Kingdom to become citizens of the aforementioned Islamic caliphate. If these wealthy countries are experiencing problems integrating and assimilating these immigrants, how much more developing countries like the Philippines, which have limited resources? Fortunately, the lessons of Bangladesh with Rohingya refugees are there to learn from.
Just like the Philippines, Bangladesh is a middle-income economy. It borders India and Myanmar. Being a predominantly Islamic country, the government of Dhaka welcomed Rohingya peoples leaving Myanmar’s Rakhine State to flee political repression. Many years have already passed but even until now, these migrants continue residing in ghetto-like refugee camps. Cholera runs rampant as clean sources of water are becoming scarce. With limited employment opportunities, they have virtually no financial capability to uplift themselves from poverty. Children are also growing up uneducated as their formative years are being wasted in these dehumanizing conditions. International organizations seem to have forgotten their commitments as Dhaka was unfortunately left to fend for itself. With those Afghan refugees, this situation might also happen in the Philippines if its leaders aren’t cognizant of the country’s limitations.
Manila must look at its own economic capabilities first, before engaging in international activities that require financial and monetary commitments. In the event that these Afghan refugees would arrive in the country, how can they be integrated and assimilated to Philippine society when prospects of employment are woeful even for local Filipinos?

Rape of the Philippines AGAIN!!! Politicians Using Makapili Whitewash Japan’s Abuses,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/rape-of-the-philippines-again-politicians-using-makapili-whitewash-japans-abuses/,"Sen. Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito has labeled Filipinos who are pushing for a diplomatic solution to the South China Sea disputes as Makapili, the term coined for Filipinos who collaborated with the Japanese, when it occupied the country in World War II.
Did Senator JV forget that it was the Japanese and Americans that massacred over a million Filipinos in World War II and bombed Manila to the ground? Japan also orchestrated the disappearance of two comfort women statues in Manila, the only country in the world that succumbed to Tokyo’s pressure! Our senators are now resorting to the revision of history. Recall our Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri going to Spain and proudly telling the Spanish Senate of the 500 years of friendship!
Ejercito’s use of the term Makapili is concerning and ill-timed as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida arrived last Friday for an official visit and bilateral meeting with President Marcos. Congress even laid down the red carpet for Kishida for a special joint address of Congress on Saturday. The highlight of the visit is the signing of an Official Security Agreement between the Philippines and Japan, which is a first.
None of the senators called out Japan for releasing over a million tons of nuclear (RADIOACTIVE) wastewater into the ocean, and wanton disregard for the livelihood of thousands of fishermen dependent on a healthy Pacific Ocean. None of the Congressmen stood up for the cry of the countless comfort women for justice and reparations.
Corruption of History
Our political leaders seem to have forgotten how the Japanese invaded the Philippines and raped and massacred countless Filipinos during World War II, with estimates going as high as 1 million deaths. The damage to property resulted in claims totaling $8B but the US whittled the reparations down to $800M delivered in installments. The destroyed infrastructure was not all rebuilt. This included the tranvia system in Manila and its spur lines to Antipolo, Montalban and Batangas. The same is true with the Panay and Cebu railways. Manila was the second most devastated city after Warsaw, Poland in World War II. Its residents suffered atrocities from the Japanese naval forces under the orders of Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita to maintain peace and order but instead went on the rampage of killing helpless Filipinos while they mounted a last stand against the American forces.
There is also the removal of two “comfort women” statues, along Roxas Boulevard and in a church property in Laguna, which paid tribute to sex slaves, who were conscripted by the Japanese Imperial Army during the war to provide sexual services to its soldiers. The statue in Roxas Blvd was initially moved to give way to the construction of a “drainage system” as part of the rehabilitation of the Manila Baywalk, according to the Department of Public Works and Highway under Secretary Mark Villar, who is now a Senator.
Presently, the Philippines is being drawn close into the Quad alliance of the US, India, Japan and Australia. It’s interesting to note though, that India has been distancing itself from this alliance and moving closer to the BRICS group, which counts as its principals, China and Russia.
Under the previous administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines seems to have found its Asian identity. Under President Bongbong Marcos today, it has gone back to being American. Public opinion is definitely more in favor of the Americans and Japan but there is no reason for Filipinos to be more hostile to the Chinese, who had never invaded or colonised the Philippines in the centuries of co-existence.
Never Forget! The US Betrayed the Philippines to Support Japan after World War II.
Over a million Filipinos perished during the Japanese occupation and the ensuing fighting for the liberation of the Philippines. The Americans abandoned the Philippines by granting it independence to focus on the rebuilding of Japan as its primary outpost in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan became a regional powerhouse, even threatened to overtake the US economy, while the Philippines stayed a laggard.
The Americans withdrew recognition to Philippine Scouts who fought with the US Army against the Japanese, when the country was still an American colony. It demanded parity rights in exchange for aid for reconstruction after the war. The US also limited the amount of reparations the Japanese paid the Philippines under the Treaty of San Francisco in 1957 which formally ended the Pacific War. Washington also failed to pay the promised benefits to the Filipino war veterans who for the US.
Under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), the US doesn’t pay the Philippines any compensation for the use of the bases, save for official military assistance, which is mostly surplus military materiel. We must not forget also how the US threw the Philippines under the bus during the Scarborough Shoal stand-off in 2012, betrayed our claims on Sabah, and failed to pay our veterans who died for America.
American President Joe Biden said that the US commitment to the defense of the Philippines in the event of an attack by China is “ironclad”. What he failed to mention was such an act requires congressional approval, which is not automatic. And, meanwhile, Filipinos who push for a diplomatic solution are labeled as collaborators or Makapili.
The question really is, who are the genuine patriots?
Those who are for a peaceful solution or those who side with the administration and the US military-industrial complex which are focus on militarizing the Philippines?",Others
