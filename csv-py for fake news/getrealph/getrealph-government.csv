The Two Padrinos of Transpo Sec Jaime Bautista,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/the-two-padrinos-of-transpo-sec-bautista/,"There are two reasons why the abominable performance of Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista hasn’t ended in his dismissal. Even giving him the gall to threaten that his departure from service would damage President Bongbong Marcos’ image.
But first, let us revisit the failures of Bautista’s performance:
– The massive power outage at NAIA that left thousands of passengers stranded.
– Passenger shipping lines unable to operate due to issues with the Philippine Ports Authority.
– The LTO procurement mistake, which resulted in a shortage of plastic driver’s licenses and a court order to stop the contract to award a new supplier.
– The increase in MRT fares and privatization of the EDSA Carousel.
– Flagship transport projects that remain on the drawing board despite being in the second year of the Marcos administration.
Most recently, the Ombudsman dismissed the former MIAA head Cesar Chiong, who was appointed based on Bautista’s recommendation. Chiong plans to appeal the decision, further reflecting poorly on Bautista.
Ordinarily, one could expect Bautista to be fired immediately after the NAIA power outage, but he has clung on to his post despite committing more blunders.
As I’ve said, there are two reasons why Bautista hasn’t been fired yet.
The first reason we got wind of via various circles is that names have been dropped, particularly that of first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos and that of Ramon S. Ang. The second reason, we surmise, is that Bautista is just extraordinarily thick faced.
You see, in response to calls for his resignation and talk of a cabinet shake-up in May this year, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista simply stated that Cabinet secretaries serve at the pleasure of the president. While this may seem like a humble response, it actually hides his defiance and insistence on continuing his work.
A month later, Partido Federal ng Pilipinas official Thompson Lantion expressed his support for Bautista and suggested that firing him would damage the image of the Marcos Jr. administration.
Lantion’s comments may not have been a direct threat to President Marcos himself, but they certainly challenged the idea that Bautista’s performance displeased — or perhaps, horrified — the president.
Perhaps due to his humility and Ilokano idiosyncrasies President Marcos tolerates Bautista’s shortcomings such as a lack of circumspection, pagkukusang loob, delicadeza, and pakiramdam.
Bautista should realize that ignoring the public’s suffering at this point would be seen as psychopathic.
It would be more compassionate and patriotic for him to step aside and allow someone more qualified to take over, such as former LTO Chief Jay Art Tugade.
Tugade has already shown his dedication to improving the transportation system and has been praised for his plans to make it easier for motorists to avail its frontline services such as renewal of driver’s licenses as well as vehicle registration.
It is clear that there are better options available to President Marcos, and Tugade is one of them. Bautista’s reign at the DOTr has been abominable, and it is time for a change.",Others
Will Ombudsman Samuel Martires Face Impeachment For Suspending NIA Administrator Benny Antiporda? (Part Two),https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/will-ombudsman-samuel-martires-face-impeachment-for-suspending-nia-administrator-benny-antiporda-part-two/,"In the first part of this series of articles on Ombudsman Samuel Martires’ six month suspension order against NIA Administrator Benny Antiporda I said I would delve into the details of the complaint filed against him and the complaint he filed against his agency’s allegedly erring subordinates.
There are two sides of this issue which must be highlighted. On one hand, there is the NIA employee’s side where they claim to be oppressed by NIA Administrator Antiporda. On the other hand, there is Antiporda’s side where he claims that NIA employees complaints is really an attempt to foil his efforts to discipline the ranks and root our corruption in his agency.
(Given that Ombudsman Martires is said to be a staunch enemy of corruption in government, one could assume that he would have looked into Antiporda’s complaint first before entertaining the harassment complaint lodged by the NIA employees. But that is not what happened and casual onlookers might be given to thinking that Ombudsman Martires sided with NIA employees accused of throwing a plunderous amount of government money.)
I have seen situations such as this several times over in the past when I was consulting for various cabinet secretaries from the time of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to even the time of former President Rodrigo Duterte.
This happened with then DOT Secretary Richard Gordon, where a union of government employees threatened him with corruption complaints after he had implemented reforms and disciplined government employees belonging to the union.
Ditto for former Agriculture Secretary Luis “Cito” Lorenzo and former HUDCC Chairman Mike Defensor where, again, government employee unions protested some manner of oppression or violation of their rights as employees.
I can’t remember the particulars of how each “union led” fight against government Department and Agency heads played out. But I remember it being said that lazy, incompetent, and corrupt government employees were eventually suspended, terminated, or reassigned elsewhere.
Harassed NIA Employees?
On the face of Martires suspension order against Antiporda, it was made to seem that employees had raised the issue of whether the latter should sit as THE ADMINISTRATOR of NIA. Further on, it alleged that because of this, Antiporda engaged in “retaliatory tactics” against employees who questioned his authority. The order enumerates the so-called tactics as:
Ombudsman Martires’ order claims that “After a careful evaluation of the records, this Office finds that among the respondents, Respondent BENNY D. ANTIPORDA’s guilt is strong and the case against him involve Grave Misconduct, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and Oppression, which may warrant his removal from the service.”
Thing is, the complaints against Antiporda sounds to me pretty much like the lament of government employees in other agencies who are battling the head of their agency after they had become the subject of disciplinary measures.
Where’s The Meat?
As I was reading Ombudsman Martires’ suspension order against Antiporda, I was hoping to find some mention of the evidence supporting the allegations made by the employees but couldn’t find any.
So, just on the basis of the Martires’ order, the public reading it would not be able to see for themselves if indeed there was “careful evaluation” and would just have to trust his word — which is fair enough, I suppose.
Then again, as I pointed out in the first article in this series, the statement from NIA Employees Association of the Philippines denying involvement in the complaint against Antiporda would make it seem that the order stems from at least one fictitious complainant.
If there were evidence, perhaps it would be in the complaint against Antiporda and my sources claim that they couldn’t find the complaint. Which leads me to ask, is the complaint so confidential that Antiporda himself wasn’t even furnished a copy of it before he was suspended?
Are officials like Antiporda not allowed to exercise their right to face their accusers and refute their accusations?
Were NIA Employees Harassed or Did They Raise Issues Against Antiporda’s Appointment and File Complaints To Evade Investigation?
Two months before Ombudsman Martires issued a six month suspension order against Antiporda, the NIA Administrator filed charges against officials of the NIA for various offenses, including violations of the anti-graft law.
Sources say Antiporda’s complaint was not acted upon whereas it took Ombudsman Martires just five (5) days to issue a suspension order that presumably would protect from further harassment one dubious complainant and several complainants who themselves were the subject of Antiporda’s complaint
It must be noted that the suspension order against Antiporda listed as complainants the “officers and members of the NIA Employees Association of the Phils (NIAEASP), (Cudal), (Raymundo) and a NIA concerned employee.
Antiporda asked the Ombudsman to “conduct further investigation and to file the appropriate criminal and administrative cases against (Atty Cudal) who is the Acting Chief Legal and Atty. Mary Annabelle Cruz-Domingo” both of the NIA Legal Division. The complaint signed by Antiporda was received by the Ombudsman on September 15, 2022.
The charges include: gross inexcusable negligence, violation of the standards of professionalism; and inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of functions. The case stemmed from the NIA lawyers’ alleged mishandling of a case where NIA lost a staggering P206 million to Green Asia Construction and Development Corporation.
Antiporda suspected that Atty. Cudal who was Acting Manager of the Legal Services deliberately moved to “abandon the case and let the same be handled by novice lawyer Cruz-Domingo so that in the event that NIA loses the case,” it can only be blamed on Atty. Cruz-Domingo.
According to Antiporda, Cudal “orchestrated that NIA will ultimately lose the case, and even made sure that the award of the CIAC (Construction Industry Arbitration Commission) will be executed at the most expedient way, which is the loss of legal remedies on the part of NIA.”
Antiporda explained in his complaint that “Had they made an effort to peruse the Rule of Court and the Rules of Procedure of CIAC, which both of them should have done, they could have easily known that the correct recourse is a Petition for Review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.”
Further on he says that “Atty. Cudal’s culpability is also undoubted. Albeit he issued a Notice to Explain and thereafter filed an administrative complaint against Atty. Cruz-Domingo after the erroneous filing of a petition for Certiorari without his approval, such actions are already after the fact and are obviously done as mere afterthought intended to save himself from blame.”
In his complaint, Antiporda further explains “As the legal manager, he (Cudal) could have acted with prudence and sedulity from the time his office received the Notice of Award from CIAC ordering NIA to pay Php 205,958,119.77. Considering the amount involved, the case should have merited his urgent and full attention.”
Michelle Raymundo, on the other hand, is the subject of a separate complaint filed by Antiporda with the Office of the Ombudsman on October 18, 2022 for “betrayal of public interest… in relation to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, habitual illegal use of a government vehicle, habitual drunkenness, discourtesy and maltreatment, grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a public officer.
Raymundo is the former Board Secretary of the NIA and as such, was issued an official vehicle, which she used for her personal use and beyond office hours to attend to regular drinking sessions with her friends and colleagues. Likewise, Raymundo is accused of maltreating her drivers.",Others
"Terror, Duterte Style Rule of Panglao Mayor Drives Tourists Away During Peak Season",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/terror-duterte-style-rule-of-panglao-mayor-drives-tourists-away-during-peak-season/,"More than three hundred guests and employees of Villa Tomasa Alona Kew Resort in Panglao, Bohol remain in shock more than a week after it was allegedly shutdown by force by Mayor Edgardo “Boy” Arcay.
Smartphone video footage taken by someone inside the resort shows dozens of police in battlegear and men armed with shotguns entering the Villa Tomasa Alona Kew resort led by someone who looks like Mayor Arcay.
More video footage from inside the resort show people huddled together crying in apparent fright and also reveal guests or employees groping around in its hallways after the resort’s power was cut.
A man with a megaphone accompanied by several others was also recorded on video blaring announcements that the resort had been closed and orders for people to leave immediately as men with shotguns roamed the resort.
The incident has reportedly scared off tourists from visiting Panglao and brought about booking cancellations as a result of the threatening closure of the resort.
In a statement by the resort’s management published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, it said, ““We, the management of the Villa Tomasa- Alona Kew Hotel Resort, have expressed fear and utmost disappointment to the recent action taken by some individuals headed by Panglao, Bohol Mayor Edgardo “Boy” Arcay for using excessive force to close out their resort two weeks ago.”
As reported in other national and local newspapers, it was said that Panglao Mayor Arcay refused to approve permits for Villa Tomasa for reasons not specified by the mayor.
Villa Tomasa still has still four years left from the five-year lease agreement and had presumably made substantial investments into the resort.
A source claims that Arcay’s refusal to grant permits may be politically motivated and may be favoring another business entity, thus perhaps prompting the resort’s legal team to state:
“The management also warns unscrupulous individuals who will be taking advantage of the resort’s current situation not to go to any negotiations without the full knowledge of the owner of the Villa Tomasa-Alona Kew Hotel Resort.”

As a result of the reportedly violent closure of the resort, criminal as well as administrative complaints have been filed against Mayor Arcay and those who implemented his orders.
According to one of several complaints filed, the allegations include “Kidnapping and Serious Illegal detention, Violation of the Anti Terror Law, Robbery by band, Grave Coercion”.
So far, there are no reports regarding the response of the Mayor Arcay and those named in the complaints.
The DILG has been expected to issue a statement regarding the violent closure of the resort but has remained silent. This has prompted observers from Panglao as well as other areas to question on social media the department’s lack of concern over the use of excessive force that terrorized tourists and possibly damaged the country’s reputation as a tourist destination.",Others
Dumaguete City Government To Sign Joint Venture for 174 Hectare Reclamation Amidst Raging Protests,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/dumaguete-city-government-to-sign-joint-venture-for-174-hectare-reclamation-amidst-raging-protests/,"Dumaguete City Mayor Felipe Antonio B. Remollo is grossly understating the devastation that his pet 174 hectare reclamation project will bring to the people of provinces surrounding the Bohol Sea — also called the Mindanao sea.
This even as today Mayor Remollo and other city officials pushes through with the the contract signing of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for the so-called “Smart City” in the face of citizen-led protests.
Unlike reclamation projects within a bays such as Manila bay where the resulting damage can be naturally contained, the proposed reclamation project juts out into the Bohol Sea where debris as well as all manner of pollution will be carried out and circulated for years.
The project entails years of dumping 17,400,000 cubic meters of soil, sand, and rocks over an area more two and a half the size of the Mall of Asia or four times the size of NAIA.
The resulting disturbance of the seabed in the area is certain to spread debris and pollution over throughout the Bohol Sea which feeds the provinces of Negros, Cebu, Leyte and Bohol as well as provinces in Northern Mindanao Region and Caraga Region.
The impending environmental devastation is further described in detail in a joint statement signed by Silliman University President Dr. Betty McCann together with former SU presidents Dr. Ben S. Malayang III and Dr. Angel Alcala — former DENR Secretary.
The statement reads:
We’re scratching our heads trying vainly to figure out the kind of thinking that led DENR Secretary Roy Cimatu to approve the area clearance for the Dumaguete reclamation project in December 2019.
This is an absolute turnaround from former DENR Secretary Gina Lopez’s widely popular shutdown of all mining operations in the country which saved millions of hectares of forested land.
We’re not sure if this has any bearing on Cimatu’s support for what appears to us an environmentally unsound project that could destroy the Mindanao Sea, but we have come across information that a certain Lem Faustino was seen inspecting the future reclamation site.
We asked around and it seems Ms. Faustino here, apart from going on site inspections in Dumaguete City, will be running for Mayor in Calumpit, Bulacan. For certain, campaign expenses in this season of COVID-19 may be quite steep and one must have the means.
Lem is said to be the sister of Mayumi Faustino who is said to be very, very close to Cimatu. Perhaps coincidentally, the Faustinos own a construction business and it was said that they’re getting a lot of government contracts — though I am not sure if a substantial number came from Dumaguete City.
However, the money that
Somebody will become billionaires out of this. MY ESTIMATES: Project cost: 23 Billion Pesos. Area: 174 hectares or 1,740,000 square meters.
Backfilling Depth: estimated at not less than 10 meters. Estimated required volume of backfilling materials: not less than 17,400,000 cubic meters.
Truckloads needed (carrying cpacity 16 cubic): not less than 1,087,500.
Price per cubic: not less than 500 pesos.
Projected income: 8.7 Billion pesos.
Projected destruction: 174 hectares of seabed and marine sanctuary + 174 hectares of earth materials from our mountains.
THE PROMISE OF PROGRESS AND WORK IS THE BAIT. BUT WHAT IS THE CATCH?
Earnings of those behind the project:
ON TOP OF THE INCOME OF LAND DEVELOPMENT,
Projected Buildable land area: 60% of 174 hectares or 1,740,000 square meters = 1,044,000 square meters; Present market value – 60,000 per square meter.
Total income to be generated – 62,640,000,000 or 62.64 Billion Pesos vs investment of 23 Billion Pesos.
What does our government get in the transactions, only public spaces. No buildable areas.
In the JV agreement, the City is the applicant of the reclamation, but the contractor and those behind it are the owners of the project.
Another curious detail about the Dumaguete reclamation project is the city government’s joint venture partner which is said to be E. M. Cuerpo. It seems the company recently figured in allegations of a rigged bidding in Negros Occidental.
The article reads:
“Provincial Budget Officer Jose Percival Salado has denied allegations of an anomalous public bidding for the construction of the P450-million NEGROS FIRST cyber center amid speculations that the Provincial Capitol is favoring a contractor.
“In December, the Pre-qualification, Bids, and Awards Committee, chaired by Salado, declared the joint venture of the Quezon City-based E. M. Cuerpo Inc and Yanson Dynamic Builders and Construction Company Inc. the winning bidder for its P449,873,520.20 tender.”
Moreover, it was also Cuerpo that faced an investigation by the Clark International Airport after a ceiling it allegedly installed collapsed.
In an article from CNN Philippines, it said:
Clark International Airport Corporation President Jaime Melo on Wednesday said its legal team has started reviewing the contract of E.M. Cuerpo Incorporated, the contractor of the old passenger terminal building, following allegations the airport was constructed using substandard materials.
“We can get back to the contractor if we find that its substandard… We’re checking if its substandard. We’re checking the contracts done six years ago,” he said.
A deeper look into some comments on a number of posts on Facebook allege that E. M. Cuerpo is a front for another Chinese corporation.
They are not making a reclamation that is adjacent to the Dumaguete shoreline.
They are making an island. Meaning you can’t just access it from any of our territorial boundaries . They’ll put bridges. So this owners will have control of the entryways. It is private property after all.
And this EM Cuerpo Development only just recently qualified as a quadruple A contractor.
He is just fronting for Chinese Nationals.
Hay, the insik will be everywhere here. They’ll bring their gambling, drugs, prostitution with them.
We’re up in arms about the West Philippine Sea, Scarborough shoal etc and yet now , there will be an island 30 meters away from our coastline.
Hello New China Territory! What they are not mentioning are the casinos they’ll have there.
The city officials (with exception to Perdices and Arbas) are enticing the Dumaguetenos with promises of jobs yet we all know, basing from what is happening in Metro Manila, these Chinese bring their workforce in from China because labor is cheap and there are no labor laws to speak of from where they came from.
Furthermore, it was said:
POLY CHANGDA is the investor. EM CUERPO is just the developer. Both the mayor and the developer want to get this contract signed. This is the requirement for POLY CHANGDA to release the funds. Poly Changda, also known as the Guangdong Provincial Changda Highway Engineering Co,- a Chinese company.
What the… It’s bad enough that the Chinese have gotten a couple of rocks in the West Philippine Sea, swathes of Pasay City and Paranaque City… NOW THEY’RE GOING TO GET DUMAGUETE CITY TOO?
Is reclamation the only way towards progress?
Nearly ten years ago, I campaigned hard for a reclamation project in Manila bay after seeing how it could alleviate the terrible congestion that we Manilenyos experienced from sun up to sun down.
Manila was choking in overdevelopment and squalor. Sky high residential condominiums and sprawling malls suffocated the open spaces that once used to be playgrounds and promenades even as informal settlement areas were bursting onto the streets.
Getting to and from places within a four kilometer radius took hours on streets filled with smoke, garbage, people, interminably open excavations,  potholes and untreated sewage. That is, if it wasn’t raining because even a ten minute downpour would render all major streets impassable because of chest deep floods.
To most of us  who lived in Manila who welcomed it, reclaiming hundreds of hectares seemed to be the only logical solution to urban congestion.
We figured that Manila Bay was long dead anyway and creating new land from the dead bay would allow us in the city room to breath, that would in turn enable us to rethink the development of the inner city without the duress created by the problems of congestion.
Opposition against the new reclamation project on Manila won and the project was shelved indefinitely.
Today, other solutions to inner city congestion in Manila has come online and this has forced those of us who were for initially for it to rethink our positions — if not, to completely abandon the idea.
The opening of the Skyway Stage 3, the expansion of the MRT lines, and others have vastly shortened commuting times to and from areas farther north and south of Manila. The Balik Probinsiya program that was launched last year as part of the the government COVID-19 response also somewhat had an impact on urban congestion.
All of the above and others that I may have neglected to mention show that there are ways to preserve the environment and cultural heritage even as we rush headlong towards development and progress.",Others
"After “Achievement War,” Yellows fail to Prove that their Admin was “clean”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/achievement-war-yellows/,"The way the Duterte-Aquino “Achievement War” rolled a while back demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of political discourse in the country. Although I would hammer the Aquino side more, I maintain the point I made in my earlier article “Positive should never be used to cover the Negative Up” that achievements by politicians are not a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Both sides are throwing out achievement lists to try and show that their president is better. If you ask me, I’d trust Ben Kritz’s article that compares the two sides based on quality over quantity, giving the Duterte side a little advantage. But for me, no matter the achievements, corruption or any huge mistake will soil any record. Political leaders should be punished accordingly for those, or at least should not be heaped with high praises.
But here’s why I would hammer the Aquino side more: the Yellow side is more cultic. In my article on GRPSupport, BS Aquino Fandom reflects Starstruck Ignoramusness and Wokeness, I showed how the blindness of Aquino supporters continues to this day. They continue to insist that BS Aquino is an unblemished, faultless saint, even if so many lucid moments of callousness and in-your-face disrespect of others were recorded.
Opposition keeps harping on Duterte, or even Arroyo and other presidents, as evil (it’s obvious that they consider anyone not on their side as evil). On Duterte, they keep parroting the kwentong barbero (barber shop gossip) that he maintains a secret hit squad from his days as mayor, never mind that this cannot be tried in court without any proof (Let me also reemphasize that Aquino himself likely had his own private goon squad and may have ordered hits, as I mentioned in my GRPSupport article). Just that contrast, the Aquino fandom insists, justifies preferring Aquino over any other to the point of worshipping him.
I think Aquino worship is already the sign of a mental disorder, since people are willingly blinding their eyes to obvious signs. You may call Duterte worship like it, but I think Duterte was different in that he never pretended to be the good guy. The Aquino side was the devil who takes the guise of an angel.
But as I said, the problem with Filipinos is how they treat leaders as silver bullets. They think, choose the right leader for the job, the “born leader,” or the clean, faultless leader. The truth is, no such person exists. There is no such thing as a naturally “good person.” All people are on equal footing and do either good or bad at different times. And, as I said in an earlier article of mine, I more believe that the role of leaders, especially national ones, is perhaps overrated and that things move forward despite more than because of them. People should lead themselves.
It’s a given that any administration should come up with infrastructure and achievements. Praise is best kept to a minimum for anyone. It’s the foul-ups that are something to measure and to harp on, especially those of the ever-holy, uninsultable Yellow Saint.
I still think the Yellow Cult still wants to do the dumb thing called overthrowing government so that they could take over and maximize their gains. They should be denied that.
The Yellow Cult also believes in the baloney saying, “when you are neutral, you are actually siding with the oppressor.” I believe neutrality is a legitimate thing, and painting one side as “evil” is just a publicity ploy. There are no good or evil sides in politics, only vested self-interests vying with each other. The recent spat between Florin Hilbay and Antonio Carpio seems to prove this.
The said spat also seems to be a leftover of the Balay vs. Samar days of Aquino’s term. I wonder what other things would come up related to this. It would be interesting to see if this fully exposes the “good guys” as vested interests and bursts the Yellow Bubble for good.
I wonder if it is finally making some Yellow supporters ask themselves how could two anti-Duterte people quarrel. “How could they not put up a united front? They’re the good guys right? But wait… are they actually vested interests working for selfish gain?”
Truth hurts. But if you don’t accept it, it can hurt even more.",Others
Haiyan (Yolanda) comprehensive rehab plan implemented under Duterte after delays due to Aquino admin snub,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/haiyan-yolanda-comprehensive-rehab-plan-implemented-under-duterte-after-delays-due-to-aquino-admin-snub/,"Remember Typhoon Haiyan, a.k.a. Yolanda in 2013? The most powerful supertyphoon to hit the country during the Aquino administration? Much of the blame for the bungled rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts post-Yolanda was borne by Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who was appointed by then President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery. As it turns out, the creation of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (OPARR) was only by virtue of a Memorandum Order. It wasn’t even an Executive Order which would’ve given it more effective authority and power. Memorandum Order No. 62 didn’t even mention a funding source for its operation, much more a location where it would hold office, even if it was attached to the Office of the President.
Yolanda resulted in the deaths of 5,902 Filipinos in Eastern Visayas. This is the official count but the unofficial is higher. It affected, 12,139 barangays, 44 provinces, 591 municipalities and 57 cities in the path of death and destruction it left in its wake. The comprehensive action and rehabilitation plan submitted by Sen. Lacson before he resigned his post on February 15, 2015 was never implemented by President Aquino. It wasn’t even in the national budget until 2017 when it was included in the proposed national budget for 2017 by the new administration. Despite the availability of intelligence funds and the President’s social fund, release of which are at the discretion of the President, Aquino never made any, much to the consternation of Sen. Lacson. In fact, most of the funds of the OPARR were provided for by non-governmental organizations led by USAID, UNDP and JICA Even the printing of the final report was funded by USAID. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been submitted.
The comprehensive report submitted by OPARR became the basis for the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction program which was finally implemented under the current administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. Thus, contrary to the widespread belief that it was Lacson who failed at the task, it turns out again that it was Aquino all along. The snail-like pace of the rehabilitation efforts under the watch of then Vice-President Leni Robredo also led to her being dismissed from her post as Housing Czar in November 2016. This was after the President and the Vice-President were the guests of honor at the anniversary of the Yolanda survivors three years after the supertyphoon leveled Tacloban City.",Others
Cash-telo for QC Mayor o Vice Mayor? Huwag Po! Huwag Po!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/cash-telo-for-qc-mayor-o-vice-mayor-huwag-naman-sana/,"Kung ang nakikita niyo sa Facebook lang pagbabatayan niyo lang sa pagboto niyo sa 2022 ng mayor o vice mayor ng Quezon city, baka magkamali kayong iboto si Councilor Winnie Castelo.
Ang mga manaka-nakang pagpapakitang gilas nito sa harap ng kamerang gamit sa Facebook videos at mga litrato ang nagtatago ng mga kahindik-hindik na mga gawaing di nararapat para sa isang pinuno ng lungsod.
Nuong halalan ng 2019 lamang nakita na ang tunay na kulay ni Castelo at kung gaano kawalang kwenta ang mga salitang binibitawan.
Tatlong taon nang nakakalipas nang maghayag ito na tatakbo bilang Vice Mayor ng Quezon City. Katambal siya dapat ni dating congressman Bingbong Crisologo.
Matapos mag-iikot at magpakitang nagtitipon para sa pagtakbo bilang Vice Mayor, bigla na lang itong naglaho at tumakbo na lang bilang konsehal sa District Two ng Quezon City.
May mga nagtanong sa distrito niya na mga kaibigan ko kung ano ang nangyari sa suportang natanggap ni Castelo at mayroon din sa kanilang nagsabi na malamang napa-atras kapalit ang malaking halaga.
Bilang isang matagal nang communications consultant sa politika, ang sabi ko maraming dahilan ang pag atras ng isang nagpakilalang kandidato.
Sabi ko maaaring kulang sa pondo o di kaya pangit ang resulta ng survey. Pwede ding napakiusapan at pwede ding nga na nakipag CASH-sunduan.
Sa mga yan, hindi ko masasabi ng tahasan kung ano talaga ang dahilan pero given na may mga nakapaligid kay Castelo na kilalang hustler at raketero, di ko ma eliminate ang ikahuling posibilidad.
Sa pag-iikot ko sa district two, lagi ko ngang nadidinig ang bansag kay Castelo na Cashtelo.
Anya ng isang matandang political observer, bantayan mo kung ano ang papansinin ni Cashtelo at malamang may pakay yan dun.
Sabi niya, “Mula sa trapik dahil sa construction ng MRT hanggang sa mga away away ng subdivision, pansinin mo. Binaril nga nyan sarili niyang pwet para lang makasuhan ang isang sheriff   at para gumulo lalo ang kasong kaugnay ng isang writ of possession.”
Dagdag pa ng nakausap ko, “Huwag na nating pag-usapan yung mga kwento sa kongreso nung congressman pa yan. Kung sa mga reporter may nababayaran para mag-ingay, ganun din sa kongreso..”
Pero, kung ganun, kataka-takang walang naibalita tungkol sa kung ano man ang pinatutungkulan ng kausap ko.
Kung sabagay, di na bago ang kagawiang paghahatag sa mga reporter para magtikom ng bibig at ang pagpapayola sa mga editor o producer na huwag maglabas ng negatibong balita.
Kung tutuusin, minsan lang nadawit ang pangalan ni Castelo sa napakasamang balita.
Ito yung tungkol sa pagkakapatay sa boyfriend ng babaeng kapatid ni Konsehal Winston na si Nanette Castelo Daza.
Nung unang lumabas ang balita tungkol sa pagkapatay kay Noel Orate, a district manager of United Laboratories, nasabing MURDER ang nangyaring pagkakabaril sa kanya ng limang beses habang nasa loob ng bahay ng mga  Daza sa Maningning Street, Barangay Teachers’ Village East in QC.
Ang salarin ayon sa mga naunang report ay si Allan Robes na nakita ng mga pulis na may dalang baril habang palabas ng pinangyarihan ng krimen.
Sa tinutulan na hatol ng piskal sa Quezon City, naging homicide na lang ang kaso kay Robes imbes na murder.
Paano naging ganun, anya ng mga kampamilya ng napatay na boyfriend ni dating Congresswoman Nanette Castelo Daza?
Kung self-defense, bakit kailangang limang beses barilin? At bakit may baril na dala si Robes sa pamamahay ni ex-Congresswoman Nanette?
Sa kalaunan ng pagdinig ng kaso laban sa asawa ng pamangkin ni Konsehal Winnie, pinalipat ng mga kamaganak ng napatay na si Orate ang hearings mula sa Quezon City papuntang Makati City. Ayon sa mga Orate, nangangamba sila na gantihan ng mga Castelo at mukhang hawak nila ang batas sa Quezon City.",Others

Professor Randy David writes in his Inquirer piece “Politicking in the midst of a pandemic” of President Rodrigo Duterte’s address to the nation the other night saying that it is “insensitive, it is irresponsible, it is disheartening—and it leaves one wondering if the country’s highest public official has any notion at all of the gravity of the ongoing pandemic, and how it is affecting every aspect of our people’s lives.”
No president in his right mind should use his weekly meetings with his COVID-19 team to talk about his political plans when he finishes his term. But that is exactly what President Duterte did last Thursday in his address to the nation. He laid out what he intends to do if he is elected vice president in 2022.
David, however, is being selective in his indictment of the Duterte government by cherry-picking an episode and expounding on it out of its proper context. Indeed, it is actually the Opposition and not the incumbent administration he should be picking on. It began in 2016 and never stopped — not even to unite the country to combat the pandemic. The Opposition is, in fact, responsible for vaccine hesitancy. If there was no vaccine hesitancy then we wouldn’t be hitting record-high case numbers in the midst of the Delta-induced surge. Unfortunately, Opposition “influencers” like “social media expert” Noemi Dado who have tens of thousands of followers spread misguided opinions about vaccines that misled many people.
Make no mistake, though. The administration is also at fault to some extent what with Senator Bong Go allowing hubris to get the better of him. The Opposition is also responsible for this development because they made Go popular by linking him to anomalies and the stupid opposition Senators calling him to the Senate “in aid of legislation.” When hubris hits you hard you begin to have delusions of grandeur like aspiring to become President.
I cringe at the thought of Bong Go as President. Majority of the public is of the same sentiment. The loyal aide is also dispossessed of gravitas. You cannot become President on the basis of “ang bisyo mag-serbisyo.” Even if he graduated from the De La Salle University (DLSU), I don’t think he has the intellectual capability to carry out the functions of the Presidency. You need to be politically-savvy to get legislation past Congress. Go’s power emanates only from his role as gatekeeper. That’s about it.
Those in the Opposition like David who believe that Inday Sara “Daughterte’s” statement the other day is part of the family zarzuela are not giving credit where it is due. Sara does not embrace the reputation of being the subservient daughter. She is, in fact, the family’s bastonera; the one who keeps everyone in line or makes them toe the line whenever they stray.
The revelations made at the Senate inquiry the other day landed Go in hot water. His reaction was to ask Health Secretary Francisco Duque to resign. That’s code for being the fall guy. The problem with the Opposition is they make it appear that their hands are clean when there were also anomalies during their time. Corruption goes both ways. The only difference now is we’re seeing more accomplishments because public funds have been cascaded and projects have been completed despite the nagging issue of absorptive capacity because of the bureaucracy. Whoever wins the Presidency should seriously address this.
The truth is the Ease of Doing Business Law hasn’t achieved its purpose because the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) has been consumed by the bureaucracy as well. Before this law, departments and agencies already had citizens’ charters but few were compliant. The perennial problem has always been enforcement. This is why the public should actually scrutinize candidates’ platforms instead of falling for gimmicks like free housing for informal settlers and the usual PR stunts of traditional politicians like Vice President Leni Robredo. If you think that a Mayor with only three years of experience is qualified to become President you’re dead wrong as well.
Platform of government is what’s important in these very trying and challenging times. What we need is innovation and out-of-the-box solutions to the problems we face moving forward in living with Covid in our midst. We’re now in the homestretch of the deadline for filing of certificates of candidacies. The political picture will get clearer in a month’s time. The Opposition should buckle down and do its homework.",Others
Andaya Names The Albatrosses Around VP Leni’s Neck,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/andaya-names-the-albatrosses-around-vp-lenis-neck/,"I don’t know what to make of former House Majority Leader Rolando “Nonoy” Andaya Jr.’s supporting a call for Vice President Leni Robredo to run in 2022 for Camarines Sur Governor.
“Tuloy po tayo sa pagtakbo bilang Congressman. At meron po tayong mas mataas na tawag. Pero ang pangako ko si Governor Leni, ikakampanya ko siya sa probinsya nang walang gastos at hindi ko siya kasama,” Andaya was quoted saying in a radio interview in DWOS 103.9 BOOM FM Naga.
However, Andaya said that he will leave the decision on Robredo whether she will take the responsibility on serving her fellow Bicolanos or she will take a higher position in office.
There have been initial talks between Andaya and Robredo wherein it was said that the Vice President will run for governor of Camarines Sur in the May 2022 elections and that will never change.
If it is a political play, it is surely a deft one that will pit her love for her Bicolano kababayans against her ambition to seek the Presidency in 2022.  While, at the same time, and this is IF VP Leni goes for it, it may lead to the toppling of the decades old grip of the Villafuertes on Camsur.
Surely, VP Leni whose late husband Naga City Mayor then DILG Secretary Jesse was touted to be the cleanest and most effective local executive, would be a far better governor than the Villafuertes who have lorded over their province’s treasury.
And so, Andaya might be right in supporting calls for her to wrest the reigns of power from the Villafuertes.
Andaya, vows to give his “all out and unconditional support” for VP Leni’s candidacy as Camsur Governor. “May isa akong salita, kapag sinabi ko na, hindi ko na pwedeng bawiin pa,” Andaya said in the same radio interview, but also pleaded not to prolong her final decision on what position she will run for in the 2022 elections.
Andaya also said, perhaps assuming that VP Leni will run for Camsur Governor, that she should distance herself from personalities that tended to cast deep, dark shadows on her image.
He identified them as Judy Cheng-Del Castillo alias De-Cheng who is a contractor, Nonoy Magtutrepor, Bolet Bañal alias Boylet Banyal, Councillor Lavadia alias Labadaba, and Dong  Cucio alias Sokyo who is a known election operator.
“Kung ako sa kanila, kung nais nilang protektahan si VP Leni, mag-volunteer na lang silang umalis dahil nakakasira sila sa imahe ni VP Leni,” Andaya said.
“Ayaw kong magkaroon ng masamang imahe si Leni dahil kung palagi kayong nakasiksik sa kanya, nais niyo bang iparating sa publiko na immoral din ang aming magiging gobernador?,” he added.",Others
On the San Beda alumni petition against Duterte’s South China Sea statements,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/on-the-san-beda-alumni-petition-against-dutertes-south-china-sea-statements/,"I have refrained from political posts on my Facebook account in deference to my friends who are on the opposite side of the political fence, so please indulge me on this issue of the San Beda alumni community petition that President Rodrigo Duterte retract his statements on the South China Sea row with China because I cannot let this pass.
As one who has a media background, this interview of former Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) Chairman Winston Ginez who was among those who signed the petition is cringe-worthy because it is akin to leading the witness in legal parlance. You have an anchor who is trying very hard to speak English with an American accent and a lawyer whose grasp of spoken English is poor. Shame considering he is a Bedan lawyer.
The issue of the South China Sea dispute is not as simple as the Opposition paints it to be. Any freshman lawyer will tell you arbitration requires two parties who agree to subject themselves to the process. How can it be arbitration when only one party is present?
The historical underpinning of China’s claim cannot be discounted. The Chinese have been in the Philippines long before it became the same under the Spaniards. If you read the history of the islands in the South China Sea, the Spaniards and the French claimed some of them during the time of their colonial outposts in Vietnam and the Philippines. In fact, these were included when Spain sold the Philippines and what is now the Northern Marianas Islands to the United States in 1898 under the Treaty of Paris.
Kalayaan Island off Palawan was first “discovered” by self-proclaimed Admiral Tomas Cloma. Cloma subrogated his claims to the Philippine government which led to then President Ferdinand Marcos issuing a Presidential Decree forming the Kalayaan Island Group and making the same under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government of Palawan.
The concept of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) originated from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. If EEZs were strictly enforced, these would be overlapping. Case in point, Taiwan controls the island of Itu Aba, which is just off Kalayaan. If the Philippines and Taiwan were to enforce the EEZs of each island, there would be a conflict because these would straddle parts of both islands.
During the administration of former President Fidel Ramos, the Philippines lost control of Mischief Reef. The Chinese built “fishermen’s shelters” on the formations. China wasn’t an economic and military power yet during this time but you can now see how they’ve built artificial islands which are actually fixed bases forming a defensive line for the Chinese mainland.
If the Ramos administration and those which came after it had any foresight, budget allocations would have been made for similar formations claimed by the Philippines but none of the sort was done. Case in point is Ayungin Shoal. A Philippine Navy ship was grounded there and serves as the base of Philippine Marines stationed on the ship.
As one who is familiar with marine and fisheries products, I can point out that our country does not have an ocean-going fishing fleet. The Taiwanese have long been poaching in our waters with their clipper boats. These are fishing vessels with on-board processing and freezing lines which process the catch as soon as these aree brought aboard. The catch is destined for both the domestic market in Taiwan and the export market, primarily the Philippines. In the consignacions in Navotas and Malabon, these fish are known as Japayuki. If we want to exploit marine resources in our EEZs then we need to have a fishing fleet to do it with. One reason why the price of fish is high is because of the presence of a number of traders between the fishermen who actually go out to sea and the wholesale and retail markets in Navotas and Malabon.
It is very convenient to blame Duterte for all of the problems of the country at present. Ginez claims he doesn’t have a political agenda. I call bullshit on this. His track record at the LTFRB speaks for itself. He cannot say that he did not owe his appointment to the powers-that-be during former President Noynoy Aquino’s administration. If you want to understand how government works, you should try joining it. I did at the local government unit (LGU) level and I only lasted eleven months. It is difficult to reform a system which is infested by leeches who benefit off it. This is why they are against digitization. It would mean the end of all those rackets off which they make money.
Finally, if we, as Bedans, are to be true to the words of our alma mater hymn, which this “fraternal statement” also cites, we should look at ourselves in the mirror to be sure that there are no hidden agenda or vested interests at play.
This was evident in the interview when the anchor referred to the Talk to the People of the President as a “show” with former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile as a “guest.” The two could’ve discussed the issues among themselves in a room but, no, they just had to air it.
The host probably isn’t aware of the concept of Presidential prerogative. This is what Enrile was emphasizing to the President — that he is the only architect of the country’s foreign policy by virtue of the mandate he received from the people with whom he has a social and moral contract with.
The problem with Filipinos is we can’t decide if we want the rule of law or mob rule to prevail. Any lawyer worth his salt is aware of this. It is part and parcel of the code of professional responsibility which lawyers should strictly adhere to. This is why dura lex, sed lex; the law may be harsh but it is the law.",Others
Why the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the Philippines is like a typical Manila rush hour experience,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/why-the-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-in-the-philippines-is-like-a-typical-manila-rush-hour-experience/,"Watching how the COVID-19 vaccine comes available to the Filipino public in recent days reminds me of the state of public transport in the Philippines. The service is inconsistent and unpredictable — all madness and very little semblance of method. Like the variety of buses, jeepneys, and all sorts of mechanical contraptions that clunk along into the line-of-sight of commuters waiting to climb over one another for a ride, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in dribs and drabs — even managed at the town or municipal hall level — originating from a variety of suppliers and donors and branded in a variety of acronyms and pharma badges keep the public on edge. Because there is no scheduled arrival, trusting a queue does not make sense to the average Filipino — whether as a commuter or as a COVID-19 jab candidate.
If you’ve experienced waiting for a train or bus in an advanced country, you’d see the big difference. At a train platform or bus stop in, say, Tokyo, you could read a book or play with your phone pretty much assured that the service will arrive to schedule. Knowledge that all are in train to schedule gives you the confidence to keep your place in the queue (where there is one) and trust that others will do the same. You trust the system and this trust is reflected in the behaviour of the community while waiting. In the Philippines, it is very different. There is no system and, therefore, no schedule to the delivery of any service, and so Filipinos are always on the alert for an opportunity to jump queue and put one over the other. Classy, right?
The way the COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out and the way Filipinos are behaving like the proverbial crablettes climbing on top of one another at every one of the slightest hints of a pharmaceutical morsel in the horizon is a tragically all-too-familiar sight and collective behaviour dynamic. We see it in rush-hour commuters and we see it today in the COVID-19 jab rollout.
“Activists” and Opposition “thought leaders” as well as their henchmen in Big Corporate Media commenting and shrieking over the minutiae of the “issue” of COVID-19 vaccine availability are pretty much useless then — because they provide insight and perspective no better than the average schmoe in this mad scramble for government services. Rather than step back and see the systemic roots of this dysfunction and exhibit an ability to connect the dots at a macro cultural level just shows why nothing much changes in Philippine society.
Like the Philippines’ decrepit public transport network — World War II era jeepneys, reconditioned buses, and home-made tricycles and pedicabs serving as backbones of the country’s transport network — delivery of products that are critical in this time of pandemic ultimately originate from afterthought leftovers from the global effort — the pharmaceutical equivalent of pagpag. Perhaps Filipinos, long accustomed to a crab-like approach to accessing stuff and the mediocre stuff they get for that effort don’t really know what they are missing overall.
Is the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte responsible for this sustained dysfunction? Perhaps it is. Then again, who cares? Really, Duterte and other presidents and the governments they led before him all presided over similar situations. The common denominators are evident and shine through regardless of government. It comes down to Filipinos’ aversion to doing things properly and systematically. This jeepney-style rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine is no exception to that sad rule.",Others
Declining trust in Bongbong Marcos an outcome of a lack of applied leadership fundamentals,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/04/declining-trust-in-bongbong-marcos-an-outcome-of-a-lack-of-applied-leadership-fundamentals/,"We cannot afford to postpone reforms. The nation’s capacity for delivering a better future for its people rests on realizing these reforms. The inauspicious start of the administration of President Bongbong Marcos was indicative of what was perceived. Indeed, it went on to prove true that his 2022 election campaign didn’t have an actual platform because it was waiting for Sara Duterte, daughter of then incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, to agree to be his running mate. The real reason for this lack of a platform may well have been the absence of a think-tank of policy wonks.
It was made worse by the fact that his designated Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez followed in the same path when it came to the composition of the cabinet. The process was marred by allegations of appointments for sale and confusion. There was even one photo which showed the president giving his top factotum a dressing down. As such, the socio-economic agenda of the administration is largely non-existent. The unfinished economic legislation lined up by the previous administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte is stuck in the legislative mill. What has been passed are laws which don’t have much of an impact because these are more palliative due to the lack of a key performance goal.
The previous administration balanced revenue generation and social amelioration. The result was two credit ratings upgrades. The Philippines made a successful comeback in the international bond markets which boded well for balancing the debt mix. Unfortunately, the pandemic hit and the debt ratio increased. The administration now is more focused on ayuda (dole outs) galore. It appears that the priority is the political agenda of amending the Constitution and the elimination from presidential contention of Sara Duterte. This, coupled with food-driven inflation, has resulted in the consequence of diminishing approval and trust ratings.
It doesn’t help also that Marcos has been focusing more on his statesmanship rather than leadership. After all, the latter is what’s needed to address the domestic problems of Filipinos and Marcos, who has a CEO style of management, has delegated that to his cabinet. His subordinates though, haven’t been able to meet the challenge. Inflation is still running high and it doesn’t look like it will come down any time soon. It doesn’t help that external factors aren’t in its favor.
Next week, the president again leaves for Washington for a trilateral summit at the invitation of the American president. As is now evident, Marcos has wasted valuable political capital by not taking a firm stand on game-changing reforms such as constitutional amendments and the review of the country’s mining laws and tax regime. It’s not as if these are alien to Marcos because he just needs to pick-up where his father left off. In mining, value-adding is the processing of the raw material, which was why the Philippine Associated Smelting And Refining Corporation (PASAR) was established in 1976 by his father, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Junior just needs to cherry-pick what’s still viable and go from there.
But here’s the thing, the largest export market for minerals is China, which Marcos continuously alienates with his pivot to the United States. While the rest of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) does business with China, we are instead relying on America which doesn’t have manufacturing capacity. There’s not much potential in expanding trade to the US.
With regard to foreign investments, the rest of ASEAN is getting more than us because of the competitive advantages they offer compared to us. Shouldn’t this be the focus of Marcos first before selling the Philippines? He has again left the issue of traffic congestion in the NCR to his cabinet for a holistic solution. We can only wonder when the solution will be forthcoming. It won’t be anytime soon. But as I always say, the optics are excellent in the Marcos administration.",Others
The Philippines is right not to join international condemnation of the Myanmar coup d’etat,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/the-philippines-is-right-not-to-join-international-condemnation-of-the-myanmar-coup-detat/,"Why should the Philippines join the international community to condemn the coup d’etat that ousted the “democratic” government of Myanmar and established military rule there? Leading the condemnation, after all, is none other than the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) which, need we remind ourselves, itself has been unfair in its treatment of the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Back in 2019, the UNHRC approved a resolution directing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to prepare a “comprehensive written report on the situation of human rights in the Philippines” within a year. This was nothing short of an insult to Filipino voters. The fact is, the Philippines remains a fully-functional democracy with a completely free (even rambunctious) press, fully independent co-equal branches of government that keep one another in check, and a dynamic free market economy. Seeing the way the UNHRC seems to arbitrarily judge how democratic — or undemocratic — a state is and get it wrong half the time highlights the presumptuosness in the manner with which it invites the international community to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
More importantly, it is evident that this whole Myanmar thing is, yet again, being used by the Philippine Opposition as another opportunity to undermine the government of their own country. Unfortunately for them, the way they go about it only further reveals their camp’s profound intellectual dishonesty. Case in point is this tweet issued by Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco.
That depends on what you mean by “we”, Mr Lasco. If by “we” you mean your lot, perhaps you should look no further than one of the leading politicians in your camp, the convicted putschist and former “senator” Antonio Trillanes, for a reality check. Trillanes remains a revered “thought leader” of the Philippine Opposition despite having led a mutiny in the mid 2000s that sought to do exactly what the Myanmar Army had succeeded at today. Trillanes was one of a number of Filipino ex-military personnel who mounted a rebellion against the government of then President Gloria Arroyo in 2003 and again in 2006. When Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III came to power in 2010, he issued Proclamation 50 granting amnesty to Trillanes allowing him to escape accountability for these crimes.
What exactly does Lasco mean when he asserts that the indifference with which the Philippine Government would regard the events transpiring in Myanmar is “not who we are”?
For that matter, what’s the big deal to begin with? The Philippines lacks any capability to project diplomatic, political, cultural, or military power beyond its shores. For all the shrill posturing of Opposition “thought” leaders like Gideon Lasco, there really is not much Filipinos can influence in Myanmar no matter how much he and his pals “stand in solidarity” with Myanmarians (is that what you call them?) protesting the demise of their “democracy”. There is much the Opposition need to focus on that is far more important than stuff happening in a little Indochinese country. Winning the 2022 elections comes to mind. Does the average Filipino voter really give a shit about Myanmar? The answer to that question may be the wake-up call the Philippine Opposition badly need to get their priorities right.",Others
It’s time to think outside our 500sqm homes about Covid_19,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/its-time-to-think-outside-our-500sqm-homes/,"Viruses mutate. We need to learn to live with Covid_19 and its variants. Going in and out of lockdown every time someone gets infected by the virus is not the only solution. Aiming for zero cases is impossible. Even if everyone wants to get vaccinated, there is not enough vaccines at the moment. Likewise, while vaccines give some level of protection, the current vaccines are not guaranteed against other mutations and ones that will likely emerge in the future.
Since we are worried about the possibility of existing hospitals being inundated by Covid_19 patients if we don’t put the community in lockdown, then the best solution is to build a hospital dedicated solely for people infected by the corona virus. If the government can build football stadiums, then surely, the government can build a hospital. Yes, it’s easier said than done. But the government must at least start with the drawing board.
It is time the government treat this pandemic like a war. We are at war against The Virus. People around the world have been locked in, unable to live freely for more then a year now. They may have been saved from the virus, but they have suffered one way or another from other issues as a result of the lockdown. There will be a generation of kids who will find it difficult to deal with the real world after spending too much time indoors and living in virtual reality. It’s akin to hiding in a bunker and living in fear of bombs over a prolonged period. That’s just one problem. There are other psychological and physical problems associated with people being locked indoors indefinitely.
It is time to take this lockdown seriously and put money where it matters to win this battle against this invisible enemy.
In addition to its short term goals, the government should start thinking of long term goals to get back to “normal” or pre-Covid state. Short term goals should include fining establishments that do not ensure their patrons comply with checking in to the contact tracing apps.
A lot of retail shops and restaurants become slack and forget to ask their patrons to check themselves in. If that is happening during a lockdown, what more come the time when there is no lockdown? Only the idea of getting fined for not ensuring patrons are checking in will keep shop owners compliant with contact tracing apps.
Those who get infected by COVID-19 should be isolated not just from the community, but also from their relatives until they are free of the virus. This is only possible though if there were enough quarantine facilities available. This is why it is imperative that the government start working on long terms goals.
Here are a few long term goals:
• Construct or have a dedicated hospital just for patients infected with COVID-19 or its variants. That was what China did in Wuhan in response to the pressure on the country’s medical facilities at the start of the global pandemic.
• Put more money into research for battling infectious diseases like viruses. If we can raise money for cancer research, we can put more money into Covid research.
• Each country should develop and manufacture its own vaccines against viruses. We cannot rely on other countries to supply our entire population.
Those are just some suggestions the government can consider in order to get off this endless loop we have found ourselves in. The government can partner with the private sector in building the needed medical facilities to ease the pressure on the existing ones. After all, it is in the best interests of businesses to keep the economy going.
As foot soldiers, we can all contribute to winning this war by taking more accountability for our actions. The government cannot police everyone. We all need to protect each other by staying home when we are sick and by complying with health regulations. Like Jon Snow, we know nothing. We knew nothing about the virus and we won’t know anything about its variants until it infects someone in the community.",Others
Chel Diokno is endangering Filipino lives by undermining government efforts to stop COVID-19,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/chel-diokno-is-endangering-filipino-lives-by-undermining-government-efforts-to-stop-covid-19/,"Opposition “thought leaders” are currently at arms because of what they perceive to be a “lambasting” that “human rights” lawyer and failed 2019 elections candidate Chel Diokno copped from President Rodrigo Duterte the other night. Indeed, Duterte spoke angrily about Diokno in his last press conference after the latter continued to issue statements seemingly meant to incite citizens to mass action against the government.
Siyempre nakikiusap tayong manatili lahat sa bahay, pero labag na sa Konstitusyon ang ordinansang ito. Ang ""24-hour curfew"" ay outright denial of the right to travel and freedom of movement. (1/2)https://t.co/4qZXem0Oy8
— Chel Diokno | #51AkbayanPartylist (@ChelDiokno) March 21, 2020
Diokno is evidently on a campaign to counter the measures being put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The measures include limits on mobility and on the number of people who may gather in public as well as curfews. Diokno follows a classic but overused playbook favoured by left-leaning holdovers from the heyday of “people power” rhetoric that highlights “parallels” with the “Martial Law Era” of the 1970s and early 1980s whenever any Philippine government hints at stronger powers to manage crisis situations.
A pandemic is not the time to be defying strong measures being implemented by the government to avert a catastrophic loss of life should the pandemic snowball. This was something Duterte, rightly so, will not tolerate at a time such essential measures need to be taken seriously.
“Just try and converge since you say it is your Constitutional right to do so. You say you are right. I say you are wrong. So try to invite 10 people to converge and see if I don’t haul you first to prison,” he said.
Countries that have taken strong measures — including curtailing certain civil liberties — are showing better results containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to countries that dither on using state forces to enforce much needed measures. In Australia, for example, fines of up to $5000 could be slapped on people found to be congregating in numbers of more than two. Unlike in deeply-divided societies like the Philippines where Opposition personalities such as Diokno encourage people to defy government orders, such police action is often unnecessary as people recognise and trust the authority of their elected leaders to look after the public interest.
Perhaps Filipinos and, specially, their Opposition “thought leaders” should observe the hard lessons their former colonial master, the United States, is learning…
The extreme partisan divide in the United States has not helped public health messaging in that country either, as a recent article in The Atlantic graphically illustrated. Under the headline “The Social Distancing Culture War Has Begun”, the writer observed a group of elderly Republicans on an Atlanta golf course making “a show of shaking hands, and complaining loudly about the ‘stupid hoax’ being propagated by virus alarmists”.
Like imperial overlord like vassal state?
It seems the colonial fruit did not fall too far away from the old colonisers. The trouble with “activists” like Chel Diokno is in how difficult it is to work out whether they are genuine in their claim to be “looking out for the public interest” or merely just posturing for media mileage in the lead up to the next national elections which, interestingly enough, is just around the corner.
Whatever the case, Diokno is certainly not helping. This is a time when Filipinos need to work together rather than against each other. The trouble with an Opposition camp that is starved for relevance and charismatic leadership is that it habitually finds the low and easy road to take — one involving merely tearing down the incumbent government to further its dishonest agenda.",Others
"Rather than complain about the government COVID-19 lockdown, Filipinos should learn to be RESOURCEFUL",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/rather-than-complain-about-the-government-covid-19-lockdown-filipinos-should-learn-to-be-resourceful/,"So-called “political analyst” Antonio Contreras’s position on the matter of the ongoing impact of the government’s lockdown on Filipino lives fails to take into account an inconvenient reality of modern society — personal accountability.
Sa gobyerno. Kung ayaw niyong lumabas ang tao, kayo ang magbigay ng mga sumusunod na serbisyo:
•Mamalengke at mag-grocery para sa amin
•Bumili ng gamot namin
•Mag-withdraw para sa amin
•Magpadala ng pera o kumuha ng pera sa LBC, Palawan, Western Union at mga iba pang padala centers
•Magbayad ng mga bills namin.
•Magdeliver sa amin ng mga orders namin
•Umayos ng mga sira sa bahay namin
•Magpainit sa araw sa apo ko pag umaga
•Atbp.
Kayanin kaya?
E sa pagdeliver nga ng relief goods, hindi pa maayos.
Should we be taking the “professor’s” post seriously? This is essentially a spoilt brat response to what are measures implemented for the common good. To be fair to Contreras, he offers his proposed solution. The trouble is, his solution is one that requires that the government do all the thinking. He is essentially saying that Filipinos ought to just sit on their asses and wait for the government to help them.
This is precisely the sort of attitude that is behind Filipinos’ beholdenness to “heroes” and the “salvation” theology preached by their state religion. It is the very kind of ingrained thinking that creates influential demagogues and gets unqualified leaders elected in the Philippines. When you have a citizenry conditioned by their “thought leaders” to feel entitled to government “help”, crafting an entire campaign platform based on empty promises works like a charm every election time.
This Juan Tamad and mentality (also referred to as the infamous palamunin culture Filipinos are renowned for) is at the core of what impoverishes Filipinos to this day — in mind, spirit, and, of course, finances. Contrary to what generations of Filipinos are taught, money does grow on trees. You just need to know what kind of tree to plant and actually get off your ass and plant it to begin with.
People like Contreras miss the opportunity staring everyone in the face here. There are business opportunities for new products and services whenever things change. Most basic of all is that people can once again revisit the lost science of backyard agriculture, for example. Indeed, Philippine society remains a fundamentally agrarian one. Unfortunately, “globalisation” had basically turned Filipinos into farmers dressed in scientists’ robes. They look like modern people on the outside but remain subsistence cultivators on the inside.
Such a society struggles to draw a line differentiating god figures from civil servants. This is why the dishonest rhetoric of their “thought leaders” resonate — because most of them play in that easy space that validates such primitive thinking. It is also why hollow figures like Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto make headline news and attract a vast fan base of starstruck ignoramuses.
Filipinos need to get a grip and focus on sorting themselves out rather than spend their days looking up with gaping mouths waiting for the proverbial guava fruit to drop from the sky. That goes to say whether in times of COVID-19 pandemic or in times of abundance. It’s time Filipinos learn to be independent and turn their back on their debilitating colonial, palamunin, and squatter mentalities.",Others
The Philippine Opposition shows callousness and stupidity during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/the-philippine-opposition-shows-callousness-and-stupidity-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"There is nothing like a crisis to bring out the worst in people, particularly those who have a weak constitution and are lacking in conviction. Take the case of members of the Philippine Opposition. I’m not just talking about the foot soldiers like Jover Laurio. I’m talking about the top honchos too like Florin Hilbay who was Solicitor General, albeit for a very brief moment, during the previous administration and former Senator Antonio Trillanes. They are two of many from the other side who have done nothing but whine against President Rodrigo Duterte. Even during a pandemic they seem to be unable to get past this unproductive habit.
“What’s new?” you might ask. Nothing, really. I guess it is partly my fault for expecting that they would put any bitter feelings aside and work towards a common goal while the whole world is dealing with a deadly novel coronavirus – a virus that has cancelled almost every activity that keeps humans busy.
In case you just came out from under a rock, in the last month the Philippines, just like a lot of other countries has been on lockdown or, as Duterte prefers to call it, Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Citizens are directed to stay home and only go out for important business like shopping for necessities and other essential activities. Obviously, this has created a lot of issues for people unable to work or pursue a livelihood and, likewise, is a major inconvenience to everyone. There is no life outside of our homes at the moment. Yes, things can get quite depressing and, especially since the quarantine is going on its second month, some people are starting to lose their marbles. They can’t seem to think straight anymore and are going on a major rampage against those calling the shots.
Members of the Opposition were already feeling powerless prior to the pandemic, but now they probably feel even more impotent because they can’t go out and protest in the streets. All they can do is make noise on social media. The funny thing about people like Hilbay and Trillanes is that their statements against Dutere cannot be considered genuine criticism. They are mostly acts of character assassination, which serve no purpose other than to entertain their own followers. Here’s one from Hilbay:
Can you believe that guy used to be the SolGen? No wonder he hardly ever wins any of his court cases. But I digress…
Seriously, Hilbay showed his immaturity yet again. There is nothing to learn from his comments. If he doesn’t want to watch Duterte’s regular press conferences while the country is under quarantine, no one is forcing him to do it. But why is Hilbay telling others not to watch it too? I thought he was an advocate of individual rights? It seems he is not keen on giving other people the freedom to choose whether to watch Duterte or not. You can bet your hard-earned peso he would be the first to complain if Duterte doesn’t conduct his presscons. And you can bet that he secretly watches the presscons anyway, he just doesn’t want to admit it. Obviously he wants to be the first to break the news if Duterte commits any faux pas so it is likely he can’t help but watch the President even though he publicly expresses his disdain. Hilbay is a frustrated little man. He makes a lot of noise to compensate for the losses in his career.
Trillanes, another bozo suffering from a crisis of relevance, also posted something on his Twitter account that proved he has a nasty and violent nature.
First of all, as a former lawmaker, Trillanes should know that budgets are planned expenses for the coming year. Has he forgotten that he was part of those who deliberated budgets proposed by the Chief Executive every year? The funds are already allotted to different departments and projects. Unfortunately, there is no budget to address the increasing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Second, if Trillanes doesn’t want to donate to people in hardship during the crisis, that’s his choice. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to donate. Only someone as calloused as Trillanes would brag about his unwillingness to help people in hardship. What he and his followers do not realise is, he is showing that he is not generous. It’s not cool to show one doesn’t want to help and it’s not nice to discourage others from helping during a crisis, especially since no one can foresee when the COVID-19 pandemic will be over. Even in First World countries, ordinary citizens and wealthy people alike are compelled to donate during a crisis because a crisis is quite often an unforeseen event. It doesn’t make sense that people like Trillanes would expect the government from a Third World country to have the funds to shoulder all the expense.
It’s quite evident that members of the Opposition are not very smart. They do not know when to stay quiet. They feel compelled to say something against Duterte even when it’s obvious they are just scraping the bottom of the barrel. The public can see through this particularly when they know that Duterte is dealing with a lot of issues at the moment. The last thing he needs is to deal with people whose only agenda is to undermine his efforts at a time he needs all the help he can get to keep the people and the economy alive.",Others
DICT Usec. Eliseo Rio’s Wounded Pride Used as Fodder by the Lame #OustDuterte Movement??,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/dict-usec-eliseo-rios-wounded-pride-used-as-fodder-by-the-lame-oustduterte-movement/,"The resignation of Department of Information and Communications Undersecretary Eliseo Rio Jr. was literally a log in the dark as far as I am concerned.
I was alerted to it by the calls and chat messages from my consultant friends in various government agencies and political offices.
Questions like “What the hell is Rio’s resignation really about?” interrupted my usual late night Youtube watching binge — which is, if you want to know, for the most part focused mainly on campers, van life, the SIG pistols, shotguns, ballistics, solar panels, deep cycle batteries, power management systems, and Brad Leonie who reminds me of Bill Murray.
Right off the bat, without knowing much about Usec. Rio, I told my friends “Whatever he claims is his reason for resigning, that isn’t it and if there’s anything that will fit into the anti-Duterte agenda, it will be played up.”
The timing, I pointed out, is suspect. Here we are in the midst of nCoV jitters and another Oust Duterte plot, then this happens.
By his statement alone, we would be led to believe that Rio’s resignation was born out of a sense of honor and propriety.
Granting that Rio’s Wikipedia entry’s accuracy hasn’t been compromised by sock puppets and bots, the awards and citations section of his wiki provides enough evidence of his character and competence.
But, having observed how some military and police officials behave when they are drawn into some manner of contest, the weaker party usually resorts to posteuring as a man following phrases in Hubbard’s Loyalty Pledge.
To wit:
If you must growl, condemn,
And eternally find fault,
— resign your position.
And when you are on the outside,
Damn to your heart’s content.
However, damning is something men in their prime can do. Otherwise it’s just resentful whining.
At least to me, his ANC interview published in the Manila Bulletin seemed to brim with wounded pride, spite, and resentment — which is more telling.
“I’m 75 years old, I thought that finally, to really spend more time with my family so that is the main reason for my resignation and of course the environment in DICT has changed, Sec. Honasan got in and talented young people and maybe they should be given more chance to work on…,” he added.
Rio, who also served as Acting Secretary of the Department prior Sen. Gringo Honasan’s appointment, also highlighted some of his achievements during his term in his letter, including the extension of the validity of prepaid load to one year, and the “lowering of interconnection charges to make text messages and call cheaper.”
Rio also took pride in being able to “conduct the successful bidding and award of the new major telecommunications player in the industry to complete wit the existing telecommunications duopoly in the country.”
The former DICT Acting Secretary also mentioned the following initiatives as contributors to “a significant spike in investments in the information and communications technology sector”:
Thing is, prior to former Senator Gringgo Honasan being appointed as the Secretary of the DICT, it seemed like Rio should have been the one appointed to head the organization.
On October 10, 2017, following the resignation of Rodolfo Salalima as DICT Secretary, he was appointed officer-in-charge of the department upon the instructions of President Duterte.  Rio was then elevated to acting Secretary of the department on May 8, 2018.[2] He took his oath of office at the Sandiganbayan on May 11.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliseo_Rio_Jr.
Moreover, IF EVER the Philippine government is spying on its citizens, Rio would know about it.
Rio was appointed as Undersecretary for Special Concerns of the Department of Information and Communications Technology and was sworn in on September 13, 2016.
As Undersecretary for Special Concerns, he was in charge of the formulation of policies, planning, and programming of Cybersecurity and Emergency Communications and the implementation of strategic programs and projects, and regional operations.
He also held various supervisory roles in agencies like the Cybercrime Investigation Coordination Center, the National Privacy Commission, and the COMELEC Advisory Council (CAC), as well as overseeing duties regarding the participation of the DICT in the activities of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
From Wounded Pride to Insinuating Honasan Misused Government Funds
It would be a LIE or at least not telling the whole truth if Rio says that he doesn’t know anything about the use of intelligence funds.  After all, he did formulate, plan and program the government’s Cybersecurity measures — which would be incomplete if it didn’t include monitoring and surveillance.
However, in another interview, we see Rio spill just enough beans to fuel the typical “surveillance paranoia” nurtured by leftist liberals in mainstream media.
My position is that the DICT does not need intel or confidential funds because it is not [within] its mandate to conduct intel or surveillance activities. But the position of Secretary Honasan is that this is needed by him,” Rio told GMA News Online.
Rio then argued that as Undersecretary for Operations, he should be at least informed on how these confidential expenses were used as part of  DICT operations.
“Since I am not included in the planning process of the use of this confidential funds and it’s limited only to the people Honasan brought with him, I felt left out and useless and as such, might as well to resign because I am not trusted,” Rio added.
The thing with Rio saying this AFTER CONGRESS APPROVED such a budget is WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE and UNBECOMING. He is simply not in a position to argue with the Secretary, even after resigning.
Rio’s statements in several other news articles were appended with mentions of COA issuing an Audit Observation Memorandum  on the disbursement of DICT funds as if this were a RED FLAG or equivalent to a DISALLOWANCE — WHICH IT IS NOT.
COA Circular 2009-006 (Prescribing the use of the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts) defines an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) as “deficiencies noted in the audit of accounts, operations or transactions and requiring comments thereto and/or submission of documentary and other information requirements within a reasonable period”.
Thus, an audit observation may be regarded as preliminary. It will still be evaluated after management submits its comments and pertinent documents, and only then will an audit decision be made whether to allow or to suspend a transaction, which may ripen to disallowance
In fact an AOM could be proven by the Department or Agency as erroneous and could be corrected through a proper response — WHICH SLANTED NEWS ARTICLES DO NOT MENTION.
DICT’s Defense of Intel Funds Use
It’s funny how the Philippine communist movement’s armed and unarmed fronts voice their SHRILL opposition to the national ID system, moves to register SIM cards, the installation of citywide/nationwide CCTV systems, and other methods of legitimate surveillance.
As colorfully said by a former leftist, “Some of these hypocritical leftists and communist criminals think that a policeman patrolling the street is already an infringement of their human rights. Matingnan lang sila o mapansin ng pulis, abuso na daw. Gago!”
In anycase, the DICT officially defended its use of intel funds and from the looks of it, it seems warranted.
The DICT said the COA did not disallow the disbursements, noting that its recommendations were procedural, pertaining mainly to the timeframe for disbursement.
“Simply put, the COA’s main concern is for the department to be more efficient in processing the relevant documents — all of which the department has addressed,” it said.
Under existing laws, rules and regulations, it said the confidential expense item is for “lawful monitoring and surveillance of systems and networks to support the DICT’s functions, which include cybersecurity, the formulation and effective implementation of the National Cybersecurity Plan, and international cooperation on intelligence on cybersecurity matters.”
With cyber threats faced by the country increasing at an alarming rate, the DICT said it is mandated to protect the security of consumers and business users in ICT matters and to render technical assistance to other government agencies on related enforcement and administration.
“This increasing problem in cybersecurity needs to be addressed immediately and effectively. To do this, the expenditure of the funds, allocated as it was by Congress for that purpose, was both necessary and indispensable,” the agency said, citing reports from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky indicating that the Philippines is among countries most at risk of online infection as well as cyber attacks on the web.
According to the agency, a key component of cyber security is information gathering on ICT systems and aiding the government agencies involved in law enforcement and the defense of the country and its people.
It said cybersecurity threat monitoring activities have a direct impact on national security.
“Strategies for cybercrime and cybersecurity incident prevention are needed, together with the proper use of cyber tools, to protect our public safety and our nation’s security. The information systems in our country needs continuous monitoring so that both domestic and foreign cyber threats and cyber-attacks can be identified, addressed, and promptly neutralized to protect the safety and security of our nation,” DICT said.

"What is national security, and why is it misunderstood?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/what-is-national-security-and-why-is-it-misunderstood/,"Renowned, retired professor Clarita Carlos from the University of the Philippines has been chosen by incoming President Marcos Jr. as his national security adviser. Filipino netizens generally responded positively with her appointment in the aforementioned position, which is usually offered to retired military personnel. Initially, the image of national security has been equated with national defense, where the armed forces play an important role in physically securing the nation-state. However, addressing issues related to national security is becoming more convoluted with other systemic problems. As an underrated position that is gravely misunderstood, now is the perfect chance to comprehend the significance of national security and its ever expanding scope of dilemmas that it should confront.
Before delving into the subject of national security itself, we begin by having this bedrock assumption that survival is a natural instinct of all living things. Biologically speaking, all living organisms reproduce to continue their species’ existence beyond their generation. To survive, they adapt accordingly to the changes of their environment and find ways to maximize their chances through evolution. This is true with human beings. As a social animal, humans interact with other humans to improve their chances of survival. This drive for self-preservation led to the creation of societies. However, the Hobbesian thought of man’s nature of being nasty, brutish, and short, calls for a Leviathan; a state that provides protection to man. Needless to say, guaranteeing man’s survival goes beyond the nation-state.
Knowing that no country is permanently isolated, developing international relationships has also been intertwined with security. This can even be observed in Philippine foreign policy where national security and economic security form two of its three pillars. With such reality, John Mearsheimer’s offensive realism theory stipulates that there is no hierarchy of nations in the world order, and it is coupled with this degree of uncertainty about the intentions of other countries. Just like human beings, all countries’ primary interest is survival, and the best way to secure this core national interest is through self-help. It is also rational for nation-states to take advantage of opportunities that maximize their chances of survival by achieving hegemony across continents. Pax Romana, Pax Mongolica, and Pax Britannica achieved roughly a century of hegemonic dominance through economic interconnectedness, political maneuvering, military intervention, and shrewd diplomacy.
With Pax Americana currently unfolding with American preponderance in technology, culture, economy, and military, the national security agenda of the United States were created, adjusted, and executed with flamboyance by their leading academics, scientists, and strategists. From there, the American national security adviser plays a definitive role in answering those threats. The presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter had showcased the sharpest realist diplomats of modern history; Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Their impactful decisions are still being felt up to this day, even though the Cold War years had long been concluded.
As the sole regional hegemon, America’s strategic interests have changed. Thus its definition and scope of national security have also dramatically widened, where it tackles different parts of everyday living. Even though national security was originally thought of discouraging, deterring, and defending against any military attack, its dimensions have transformed in various ways. Nevertheless, its primary objective of improving a nation-state’s chances of survival has never changed.
In the case of the Philippines, external and internal issues that directly threaten the survival of the Philippine state clearly exist. Externally, provocations of the People’s Republic of China in Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones are regular occurrences where the Philippines would submit diplomatic protests against these Chinese assertions. Internally, armed attacks from communist insurgents and secessionist groups are being confronted by the military. To further complicate matters, terrorists linked with extremist Islamic groups are trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan where they conceal their identities as they execute their clandestine operations. The Philippine military can never be complacent.
Another dimension of national security that produces yields to the country’s self-preservation is economic security. In recent years, several external factors like the Covid-19 pandemic, Ukrainian crisis, and all-encompassing inflation spikes in international markets have stricken global economies, and the Philippines hasn’t been spared its adverse effects. In a highly-globalized and interconnected world, market movement became more sensitive as disturbances to global supply chains affect producers and consumers alike. Thus, it is imperative for the regular Filipino to have job security and have the capacity to purchase basic commodities. Creating a country that is resilient against economic recession is indeed difficult to accomplish in this ever changing planet filled with uncertainties. Nevertheless, a security policy that seeks to strengthen and maintain inclusive economic institutions is also of great importance.
There are also a number of internal issues that became security issues as these sectors have also embedded themselves in the economy and in the society. These would include food, energy, and the environment. Food dilemmas arose due to actions that disenfranchised farmers and fisherfolks, apparent inadequacy of appropriate agriculture-related infrastructure, and limited results of agrarian reform. For energy, the Philippines has never been energy-sufficient, as the country is highly dependent on prices imposed on imported hydrocarbons. Lastly, degradation of the environment has continued endangering both land and water resources of the whole country. To tackle these national problems, protecting national interests must be in in the forefront by pursuing internal “realpolitik”. Applying pragmatic means to accomplish these lofty goals is something that the incoming national security adviser must consider.
All in all, national security should be looked at with a multi-dimensional perspective. As states and societies have placed self-preservation as their primary interest, they have taken varied measures that increases their chances of survival. If ever an opportunity arises that might maximize those chances, rational nation-states have never failed to address such. With these, the position of national security adviser of the Philippines is of great significance. Even though it is not a position that directly mobilizes the armed forces, the police, or the Philippine diplomatic corps, this adviser-role guides the head of government to make impactful decisions that goes beyond the president’s six-year mandate.",Others
"Pharmally execs Linconn Ong, Mohit Dargani, and Twinkle Dargani should sue HYPOCRITE social media “experts” for libel",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/pharmally-execs-linconn-ong-mohit-dargani-and-twinkle-dargani-should-sue-hypocrite-social-media-experts-for-libel/,"I can’t think of the right words to describe this Tweet of blogger and “social media expert” Jane Uymatiao a.k.a. “Citizen Jane” a.k.a. “The Philippine Beat”. She suggests that anyone with a fancy car who runs a business and deals with the government is stealing Filipino taxpayers’ money.
Those are serious allegations you are making against Pharmally executives Linconn Ong, Mohit Dargani and his sister Twinkle Dargani, Ms Uymatiao. Perhaps you need to take a statement from the parties you suggest are involved in criminal activities before you spread this unverified information.
My high school batchmate Gerry Santos is Mr. Freeze Ice. He owns several high-end sports cars. If he ventured into supplying the government with face masks and PPEs, does that make him a party to corruption if he buys another high-end sports car after that transaction? Alice Eduardo owns a construction company that gets government contracts. Her watch collection has been featured on ANCX. Does that make her a party to corruption?
I was in the business of restoring classic cars as the gofer of the rich who don’t have the time to attend to the details; buying the car, shop to bring the car to for restoration, buying parts, coordinating with tinsmith and painter, getting the interior of the car done by a skilled upholsterer, etc. Some of my customers were customs collectors and customs police, BIR revenue district officers and other sorts of government officials. Some I suspected to be corrupt. Others were members of prominent families in their respective provinces and had the means to pursue an expensive hobby. I couldn’t tell if they were a party to corruption or not.
Corruption exists in government. That is a fact. But it is not limited to the Philippines. Fact is, there is corruption everywhere. What varies is the level of corruption in government. Most of our politicians have palatial and luxurious residences in high-end subdivisions. They also have the best material things money can buy. Is it safe to assume they’re all corrupt? I met the man who was behind the controversial Porsche of former President Noynoy Aquino. I brokered the sale of a Mercedes Benz 190 SL fiberglass body kit to him. I didn’t ask him immediately about the Porsche. Towards the end of my transaction with him he touched on the subject. He implied that it was his gift to Noynoy which the latter accepted. I didn’t ask him for additional details. This is a man who has an original 190 SL but bought the fiberglass body kit because he wanted to build a replica race car and didn’t want to ruin the paint job on his original Benz which is what happens when you make a fiberglass mold from it.
Even Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque has a car collection. Does this make him corrupt if he’s had it since before he joined government?
As ordinary citizens we have this gut feel about corruption amongst government officials. It’s the same with elections. Vote-buying exists but it seldom happens that a candidate gets caught and jailed for it. The simple point I’m making is if we want to put a stop to corruption then we shouldn’t be hypocrites ourselves. The fact is, we are. Why are we so? In my case, it’s to earn a living. In others like the “journalist-activists” who prostitute themselves to parties with vested interests, it’s to earn extra income and be associated with powerful men and women.
During my short stint in government, what I have learned is that it is harder to reform the system than give in and be a party to corruption, at any level. There is small-scale corruption and there is large-scale corruption. The focus has been on former President Ferdinand nMarcos but the truth is, corruption never stopped even after Cory Aquino assumed power following the 1986 EDSA “revolution”. In fact, it got worse because the Marcos cronies became the targets of the officials of the new administration.
What Senator Richard Gordon is doing in the Senate now is far from the campaign against corruption that he’d like us to believe he is spearheading. It is nothing more than the all-too-familiar garden-variety demolition job on the administration one expects of any two-bit Opposition politician. Indeed, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) which Gordon served as chairman of from 1992 to 1998 was the smuggling hub for vehicles, both high-end and low-end, after it was created. Was Gordon ever investigated for this? Importers of these vehicles made a ton of money. Was Gordon blind to this or was he a party to corruption himself? Even chicken was being smuggled at SBMA in the 90s. This was how the owners of this Costco-type wholesale and retail chain made their money which turned them into billionaires. They were pioneers in introducing mechanically-deboned chicken from the US in the local market.
We should open our eyes to these realities. Let’s not by hypocrites anymore. If we want to stop corruption in government, it should come from us by way of our votes. But tell me honestly, even if we did, would we have any candidates left to vote for?",Others
Stopping ABS-CBN’s Franchise Renewal By Hook and By Crook,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/stopping-abs-cbns-franchise-renewal-by-hook-and-by-crook/,"This morning Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the franchises of ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc “as they are unlawfully exercising their legislative franchises.”
It would look like the final nail in the coffin of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal. That is if we consider that a number of cases lodged in the Supreme Court were decided in favor of Duterte’s allies and against his enemies.
Ordinarily, ABS-CBN would have 30 days in which to respond to the quo warranto position but, according to a reporter at the Supreme Court, this period may be shortened.
This is because it may be overtaken by the recess of Congress which happens in about two weeks and without bill renewing ABS-CBN’s franchise passing the Third and Final reading, this will spell the end for the broadcast network’s operations.
So far,  11 bills seeking ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal have yet to be calendared. Attempts to renew ABS-CBN’s franchise were similarly stalled in previous sessions of congress.
A copy of Calida’s quo warranto could not be obtained immediately by reporters at the scene of the filing of the petition. Attempts by reporters to interview Calida on the basis of the quo warranto petition were refused with the solicitor general saying that he was headed to another appointment. He however had time enough to rebuff one male reporter, accusing him of hitting him and told him that “you better just practice (law) so we can see each other in court.”
However, in what appears to be a statement issued by Solicitor General Calida published by Facebook page Bulatlat, it was said that the quo warranto petition filed sought to “…put an end to what we discovered to be highly abusive practices of ABS-CBN benefitting a greedy few at the expense of millions of loyal subscribers. These practices have gone unnoticed or were disregarded for years,”
Further on in the statement it is claimed that “…petition will show that ABS-CBN has been broadcasting for a fee, which is beyond the scope of its legislative franchise. Further, the media giant, hiding behind an ‘elaborately crafted corporate veil’ has been allowing foreign investors to take part in the ownership of a Philippine mass media entity, in gross violation of the foreign interest restriction of mass media provided under Section 11, Article XVI of the Constitution.
“ABS-CBN abused the privilege granted by the State when it launched and operated a pay-per-view channel in ABS-CBN TV Plus, the KBO Channel, without prior approval or permit from the National Telecommunications Commission.”
“Further, like Rappler, ABS-CBN had issued Philippine Deposit Receipts (PDRs) through ABS-CBN Holdings Corporations to foreigners, in violation of the foreign ownership restriction on mass media in the Constitution.”
Near the end of the statement it was said, “ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc (formerly Multi Media Telepony Inc) resorted to an ingenious corporate layering scheme in order to transfer its franchise without the necessary Congressional approval. It also failed to publicly offer any of its outstanding capital stock to any securities exchange within the Philippines within five years from the start of its operations, which is an indispensable condition in its franchise.”
In an interview on ANC, Congressman Rufus Rodriguez characterized Solicitor General’s petition as a direct assault to the freedom of the press and violated the equality as well as independence of the branches of government.
Rodriguez asserted that challenges to ABS-CBN’s franchise should be heard in Congress because it is the only branch of government given specific charge over the granting of franchises. He said he believes that the Supreme Court will deny the Solicitor General’s petition.
Rodriguez called on the leadership of the House of Representatives to start hearings on the bills filed in the Committee on Legislative Franchises and ASSERT its independence from the Executive branch of government.
All in all, it doesn’t look like ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal was NEVER going to be given a fair shot.",Others
Was ABS-CBN Really Sold to the Marcoses and Returned to the Lopezes for FREE?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/was-abs-cbn-really-sold-to-the-marcoses-and-returned-to-the-lopezes-for-free/,"One thing that has been going around for years now in the Get Real Community as well as communities supporting the Duterte Presidency, the Marcoses and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano is the claim that the Lopezes sold ABS-CBN to the Marcoses and this was later given back to them for FREE by the former President Cory Aquino.
Versions of this claim was spread around by a number of strong social media influencers, one that caught my eye came from one named Mark Acebedo Lopez (who feels compelled to make it clear that he is not related to the ABS-CBN Lopezes, citing that he is directly descended from the Lopezes of Granada, Spain and not the Lo Pue’s of Southern China from which the ABS-CBN Lopezes came from).
In a post on Facebook dated April 2, 2017 which was shared over 2,000 times, Mark the heir of the Lopezes of Granada, Spain asserted:
This letter from the Lopez patriarch himself, however, indicate something else. More than cordial, Eugenio Lopez actually emphasized how he shared President Marcos’s vision for the country as he offered to sell the family’s stake in Meralco. This is in stark contrast to the narrative we often hear repeated by Yellow that Marcos undertook a hostile takeover of Meralco and ABS-CBN.
When Cory Aquino became president, she returned Meralco and ABS-CBN to the Lopezes free of charge, companies that have supposedly been bought and paid for by government (aka the Filipino people).
How lucky the Lopezes because they were paid when they sold it during the Marcos years, Cory subsequently returned the companies to them for free, and they profited a second time when they finally sold their stakes in Meralco not too long ago. Plus, the family still owns ABS-CBN.
Nabayaran ka na, ikaw pa rin ang may-ari, kumita at kumikita ka pa. Ayos.
Please spread the word.
The thing with Mark’s post and other similar posts that say that the Lopezes sold their companies to the Marcoses and the same companies were given back for FREE is that it is based on a bare claim.
What Mark and others shows us is a letter from Lopez Jr. offering, in this case, Meralco for sale, it doesn’t mean that Meralco had been sold. The proper proof of such a transaction would probably be documents showing the transfers of money and transfers of ownership.
If one were really interested in the circumstances and events showing how ABS-CBN was possessed by the Philippine government under then President Ferdinand Marcos is revealed in the Supreme Court Third Division decision contained in G.R. No. 133347 published on October 15, 2008. The decision was made on a petition for certiorari made by the Lopezes the Office of the Ombudsman, Roberto S. Benedicto, Exequiel B. Garcia, Miguel V. Gonzales, and Salvador “Buddy” Tan.
The petition challenges the Joint Resolution dated May 2, 1997 of then Ombudsman Aniano Desierto in OMB-0-94-1109, dismissing the complaint filed by petitioners against private respondents, and the Order denying their motion for reconsideration.
The Lopezes accused Benedicto, Garcia, and Tan of crimes penalized under the Revised Penal Code (RPC): (a) Article 298 – Execution of Deeds by Means of Violence or Intimidation; (b) Article 315 paragraphs 1[b], 2[a], 3[a] – Estafa; (c) Article 308 – Theft; (d) Article 302 – Robbery; (e) Article 312 – Occupation of Real Property or Usurpation of Real Rights in Property; and (f) Article 318 – Other Deceits.
And to head off any remarks that this is propaganda on behalf of ABS-CBN or the Lopezes (the ones from descended from Southern China not Granda, Spain) is that decision of the Supreme Court goes against their petition and in fact says that the government takeover of ABS-CBN was legal.
What the October 15, 2008 G.R. No. 133347 has to offer us is a complete account of how the government under former President Marcos took possession of ABS-CBN and WAS NOT AT ANY POINT BOUGHT or SOLD.
Below is the pertinent portion of that decision, for all of you to read.
Individual petitioners’ complaint-affidavits3 uniformly narrated the following facts:
1. The day after the declaration of martial law, or on September 22, 1972, just before midnight, military troops arrived at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City, and informed the officers and personnel thereat of the seizure and closure of the premises by virtue of Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1 issued by President Marcos ordering the closure of all radio and television stations in the country.
2. LOI No. 1 authorized the Secretary of National Defense to “take over or control, or cause the taking over and control of all x x x newspapers, magazines, radio and television facilities and all other media of communications” throughout the country. Consequently, a total of seven (7) television stations owned and operated by ABS-CBN were closed down by the government.4
3. When it became apparent that petitioners would not be granted a permit to re-open, ABS-CBN on October 31, 1972, terminated the services of all its employees, giving each employee his/her retirement benefits. Corollary thereto, sometime in November 1972, Eugenio Lopez, Jr., then president of ABS-CBN, wrote then Secretary of National Defense, Juan Ponce Enrile,5 of their desire to sell ABS-CBN to the government. In that same month, however, Eugenio Lopez, Jr. was arrested by the military, and detained at Fort Bonifacio for almost five (5) years until his escape therefrom on September 30, 1977.
4. Subsequently, after the proposal to sell ABS-CBN to the Marcos government did not materialize, ABS-CBN started negotiations with then Governor of Leyte, Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, who expressed his desire and intention to acquire the former. However, the negotiations with Kokoy Romualdez in 1973 likewise did not result in the sale and re-opening of ABS-CBN.
5. On June 6, 1973, the television and radio stations of Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) on Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City were consumed by fire. KBS was the umbrella corporation of the Benedicto Group of broadcasting companies, including Radio Philippines Network (RPN),6 which operated TV Channel 9, the only television station allowed to continue operating during the early years of the martial law regime. Respondent Benedicto, then Philippine Ambassador to Japan, managed, controlled, and was one of the principal stockholders of RPN.
6. On even date, both Benedicto and Alfredo Montelibano, who at that time was Chairperson of the Board of Directors (BOD) of ABS-CBN, were in Bacolod. Benedicto constituted Montelibano as his emissary to the Lopezes, relaying his plan to temporarily use ABS-CBN’s broadcast studios in Quezon City, from which to operate TV Channel 9, for such period of time as may be necessary to rebuild KBS’ burned studios.
7. On June 8, 1973, Montelibano met with other officers and executives of ABS-CBN, including herein petitioners Oscar and Augusto Lopez, informing them of Benedicto’s request. Oscar and Augusto, and the rest of the ABS-CBN management team, strongly opposed the request. Eventually, however, when Montelibano mentioned that Malacañang and Romualdez had cleared said request, the possibility of a government-ordered confiscation of ABS-CBN, and not least of all, the possible release of Eugenio Lopez, Jr., petitioners Oscar and Augusto, as with the rest of ABS-CBN’s executives, acquiesced to Benedicto’s request.
8. Thus, at noontime on the same day, representatives of KBS headed by Jose Montalvo arrived at the Meralco Building to finalize the proposed arrangement with ABS-CBN. The transaction between ABS-CBN and KBS is evidenced by a letter-agreement dated June 8, 1973, which reads in relevant part:
This is to confirm the agreement arrived at between RPN and ABS-CBN to the following effect:
1. Commencing on the date hereof, ABS-CBN hereby conveys to RPN by way of lease its TV and radio equipment (excluding TV channels and radio frequencies) and its premises at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Bohol Avenue, Quezon City (collectively called the “leased facilities”) listed in the schedule attached hereto and marked as Annex “A”.
2. RPN shall pay ABS-CBN monthly rental as is reasonable compensation for the use of the leased facilities. The amount of the rental shall be determined after a discussion with Ambassador Roberto Benedicto.
3. The term of this lease shall commence on the date hereof and continue for such reasonable time as may be normally necessary for the rehabilitation of RPN’s facilities unless an earlier period may be fixed by RPN and ABS-CBN after discussion with Ambassador Benedicto.
4. RPN hereby assumes full and complete responsibility for the leased facilities and shall be answerable for any and all losses and damages to such facilities.
x x x x
6. Upon termination of this lease, RPN shall return the possession of the leased facilities to ABS-CBN and vacate the same without the need of notice or demand.
7. ABS-CBN, through its Chairman, Mr. Alfredo Montelibano, shall have the right to select and designate the personnel (not to exceed 20 at any one time) to maintain and operate all specialized TV and radio equipment.
x x x x
10. ABS-CBN shall have the right to enter the Broadcast Center at any reasonable time during the term of this lease for the purpose of determining compliance by RPN of the terms hereof.
x x x x
12. RPN shall not, without the prior written consent of ABS-CBN, sub-lease the leased facilities or any part thereof nor shall any part be removed from the premises except the equipment, which are intended for operation the Broadcast Center in due course of operations.
9. Meanwhile, it appears that the parties were hard pressed to negotiate and fix the monthly rental rate. Several attempts by Oscar to set up a meeting with Benedicto for the fixing of the monthly rentals proved unsuccessful.
10. After more than four months of trying, a meeting between Oscar and Benedicto finally materialized on October 31, 1973. At that meeting, the discussion not only covered fixing of reasonable rentals for the lease of the ABS-CBN studios, but likewise included the possibility of an outright sale.
11. Thereafter, the discussions and negotiations stopped as none of the petitioners were able to meet anew with Benedicto who had supposedly referred the matter to “people above” and the “man on top.”
12. Frustrated, then Senator Lorenzo Tañada, as counsel for ABS-CBN, in May 1976, wrote Benedicto demanding vacation of the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center and payment of back rentals for the use of the ABS-CBN studios and facilities.
13. In response, Senator Estanislao Fernandez, on behalf of Benedicto, met with Senator Tañada in June 1976. Another meeting took place between the parties’ respective counsels which included respondent Gonzales, another counsel for Benedicto. Despite these meetings, no agreement was reached between Benedicto and ABS-CBN. On the whole, from June 8, 1973, the time KBS occupied the ABS-CBN studios in Quezon City, no rental was paid by the former to the latter.
14. In the years following until the Marcos government was toppled in 1986, the ABS-CBN stations were transferred to the National Media Production Center (NMPC) headed by Gregorio Cendaña of the Ministry of Information. Starting in January 1980, KBS, on a staggered basis, transferred possession, control and management of ABS-CBN’s provincial television stations to NMPC. Some of the radio stations of ABS-CBN were turned over to the government’s Bureau of Broadcast, while some were retained by KBS thru the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Radio Philippines Network (RPN).
15. Parenthetically, during a military inventory in 1979-1980, and a visit by ABS-CBN executives at ABS-CBN’s radio transmitting stations in Meycauayan, Bulacan, headed by petitioner Augusto, on August 13, 1984, ABS-CBN properties and massive equipment were found to be missing. In addition, the musical records and radio dramas accumulated by ABS-CBN in a span of twenty-five (25) years and stored in its library were now gone.
16. In June 1986, President Corazon Aquino, acting on the request of ABS-CBN through Senator Tañada, returned to ABS-CBN these radio and TV stations on a gradual and scheduled basis.",Others
Panic over COVID-19 being kicked up by the Yellowtards is starting to wear thin,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/panic-over-covid-19-being-kicked-up-by-the-yellowtards-is-starting-to-wear-thin/,"The panic being kicked up around the coronavirus outbreak is beginning to get tiresome. Unfortunately for Filipinos, the COVID-19 scare is the latest weaponised outrage fad the Yellowtard-led Opposition is clinging onto to bolster their demonisation campaign against the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
While other societies unite to fight the spread of this disease, the Yellowtards are fomenting division. Key to their obsession with COVID-19 is the convenient fact that it originated from China. This fits their narrative to a tee — their hollow criticism of Duterte’s pivot to China and what they assert is his plan to turn the Philippines into a “province of China”.
This is not to dismiss, of course, the disturbing influx of Chinese elements into the Philippines and their emerging effects — some good, some bad — on Philippine society. However, the Yellowtards need to take a more intelligent perspective on their bashing of Duterte and ethnic Chinese people. They need to regard the issues without the partisan blinkers that stunt their thinking.
While the Yellowtards shriek about the spread of COVID-19, they seem to conveniently turn a blind eye to far more deadly and more known social diseases that kill and permanently injure far more Filipinos. The jeepney, for example, is a persistent social cancer that kills and maims far more Filipinos than COVID-19 ever will. These primitive contraptions also indirectly impact the lives of millions more thanks to the poisonous fumes they emit and the enormous traffic jams they cause. Interestingly enough, Filipinos are in a far better position to solve their jeepney problem than they are of getting a grip over biological threats. Jeepneys are, after all, a socio-political issue while biological threats demand more scientific and technological responses. Between the earlier and the latter, it is evident which of the two Filipinos excel at (or at least have louder voices to bring to bear).
Jeepneys are just one example of many problems dishonestly ignored by Yellowtard “activists” because these do not fit their dishonest political agenda. But in just that one example, the impact on Filipino lives utterly DWARFS that of what the COVID-19 outbreak would cause. Just last month, a jeepney was shown on a video running over a group of kids crossing a street. Yet no shrill expressions of outrage came from the Opposition cliques nor any calls for Duterte’s head over the continued proliferation of these killer vehicles heard.
Other diseases endemic to tropical settings seem to also escape the reach of outrage fad “activism” at the level of shrillness the COVID-19 crisis attracts. To put the numbers in perspective, almost 6,000 cases of Dengue and 22 deaths related to it were reported from January to February of this year just in the Central Visayas alone.
The Yellowtards are, indeed, a dishonest bunch of snowflake virtue signallers that have no place in a country that aspires to be a modern and mature democracy. They go as far as undermining statements released by Philippine government authorities and direct their followers to unofficial channels. For example, they are quick to flock to the statements on the matter of “vice president” Leni Robredo simply because she is perceived to be one of them.

This is a dangerous thing to be doing during a period of global crisis. Robredo, for one, has a history of making statements that damage the interests of the state such as when she told lies upon lies in a video exhibited to a United Nations forum in 2017. More recently, Robredo also pretended to be “helping” with relief operations in the aftermath of the Taal Volcano eruption when, in fact, she spent most of her time putting up a performance before the cameras to score PR points.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious matter of global consequence that demands a national response in collaboration with the global effort. This is no time for the petty divisive partisanism being exhibited by the Yellowtard-led Philippine Opposition. The crisis should not be used as a means to score political points. Indeed, with national elections just around the corner, the shrill voices emanating from the Opposition should be regarded with a critical mind. Desperation, after all, makes for ill-thought-out and misguided posturing. It’s time Filipinos see past that and seek real solutions by applying modern thinking to the challenges they face.",Others
Philippine “President” Leni Robredo in a time of pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/philippine-president-leni-robredo-in-a-time-of-pandemic/,"As the COVID-19 pandemic plays out globally, the main drive of the Philippine Oppositions is not to help Filipinos deal with the crisis together. Rather, their goal is to prove that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is not fit to lead his people through it. This is consistent with their singular objective — to seize power and re-establish the status quo that has been their comfort zone for several decades. With no credible Opposition leader charismatic enough to go up against the massively-popular incumbent, it has fallen on “vice president” Leni Robredo to be Opposition “leader” by sheer default.
The Opposition, led by the bloc within it rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards), is essentially destructive in nature and the way their members conduct themselves clearly damages the social fabric of a people already frayed by crisis upon crisis. However, it is fair to say that a scenario in which Duterte steps down as president and, as mandated by law, Robredo steps up (assuming her claim to the vice presidency is legitimate) to take office as President of the Philippines needs to be explored. What would Robredo do differently to Duterte?
So far, Robredo has played backseat driver over the course of several crises including this most recent one. As a backseat driver, it is easy to come across as knowledgeable and authoritative. Thus it really isn’t that baffling the way Opposition partisans have lapped up every one of her motherhood statements. Among the things she has “urged” President Duterte to do includes identifying funds to acquire testing kits and to “procure these test kits as soon as possible”. Robredo also encouraged the government to observe how the disease is spreading in Italy and Iran which, together, account for the most COVID-19 infection cases and deaths and learn what they “do wrong”. She also reportedly expressed an interest in “best practices” and said that the Philippines ought to “learn from the experiences of other countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan”.
This is all well and good. The Opposition has so far run with sound bytes such as those. Their main argument is to show that Robredo says stuff like that and Duterte doesn’t. But does what one person say and the other doesn’t and vice versa prove one is better than the other? It seems that the Opposition have hinged their entire obstructionist platform on Robredo’s words and Duterte’s alleged lack of counterpart statements. In this sense, the Opposition are being grossly unfair to the various government agencies staffed by professionals working together to manage the crisis and mitigate the risks of it worsening. They are suggesting that government agencies and their staff are doing a bad job — not sourcing test kits and observing “best practice”, for example — just because Duterte did not mention such initiatives in his public statements. They then go on to imply that such measures will be done better if Robredo was president.
Such a position to take is nothing short of insulting to a professional civil service. The Opposition would like Filipinos to believe that the performance and quality of work of their civil servants are directly determined by who is president and not by their professional ethic and initiative.
This gives us a hint of what a Robredo presidency would be like. It would be a selfie presidency of grandstanding and prayerful emotional blackmail. This is consistent with how Robredo behaved when she “helped” in the relief effort during the Taal Volcano eruption (one the Opposition were quick to call a “tragedy”) just a few months back. Rather than be a quiet achiever at the time, Robredo made it a point to make her involvement in the relief effort all about herself.
What could be potentially dangerous about a Robredo presidency is the fact that the small handful of Big Corporate Media organisations that monopolise “news reporting” and “fact checking” in the Philippines back her and the Yellowtard brand of emo politics. They selectively “report” the news, and “investigate” the “facts” in a manner slanted to subliminal political messages dictated by the golf buddies of their owners and top shareholders. The incestuous relationship the Philippines’ media moguls enjoy with powerful politicians was laid bare recently when Senator Grace Poe used the Senate as a prop to highlight the “plight” of media behemoth ABS-CBN before an enormous TV and social media audience. Unfortunately for Poe, the inherent conflicts-of-interest of this stunt on account of her and her family’s financial interests in ABS-CBN did not escape the scrutiny of vigilant Filipinos. A Robredo presidency will likely be no different — one upon whose coattails an erstwhile disenfranchised Yellowtard community can ride on with the benefit of billion-peso corporate media channels serving as cheerleaders.
The fact is, being president is not all about one’s self. This is something Leni Robredo needs to learn and take to heart if she is to lead Filipinos as their president. Being president is being a leader to all Filipinos and not just her party and certainly not just to her sponsors in the oligarchy. Duterte has so far exhibited unprecedented resilience — sustaining wide public approval and trust despite an army of Opposition “thought leaders”, an entire “news” media industry, and the communist-infested student bodies of the country’s chichiest universities sustaining a massive demonisation campaign against him in concert. In that light, it is easy to see what a sad pale shadow of Duterte’s government one run by Robredo would be. Filipinos need to think twice about even considering a Leni Robredo presidency specially in these interesting times. More importantly, the broader Opposition should seriously re-think the idea of being “led” by the Yellowtards — for their sake.",Others
The Opposition are desperately using the Taal volcano eruption to make Duterte look bad,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/the-opposition-are-desperately-using-the-taal-volcano-eruption-to-make-duterte-look-bad/,"In the midst of the aftermath of the recent eruption of Taal Volcano, the Opposition still haven’t gotten over desperately trying to prove that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte doesn’t care about the people. They have a habit of looking for him as soon as an adverse event happens and then ridicule him as soon as he shows up. What’s up with that??
They tried to copy the success of the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo which originally went viral in early 2015 when the public were outraged over the absence of then President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III during the arrival of the bodies of the slain members of Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police. Recall that this was a tragedy — the Mamasapano Massacre — that was due to Aquino’s negligence and recklessness in his overseeing the covert operation to capture a terrorist leader in Mindanao.
The hashtag, in the incapable hands of the Opposition today, failed to be effective against Duterte this time, however. This is because the volcanic eruption wasn’t Duterte’s fault and it was evident that the Opposition had a dishonest agenda in calling out for his presence on the first day of the eruption even when the situation hadn’t at the time been properly assessed nor the extent of damage estimated as yet.
Even more amazing, they were quick to slap the “tragedy” label even before verifiable information on casualties had come in. This is so they could emotionally blackmail Duterte’s supporters and paint the government under a negative light. Supporters of the Opposition who have a strong following on social media are always quick to jump the gun and paint the current government as “uncaring” and slow to act.
For that matter, why would a volcanic eruption, which is a natural occurrence, make the government look incompetent? Critics were just too quick to criticise. They were already looking for a reason to hit Duterte on the very first day the volcano erupted.
The fact is, things turn “tragic” only when people get caught up in it. In this instance, the people were evacuated in a timely manner. A lot of the animals were evacuated too. Yes, there was damage and impacted lives. Yes, there are major inconveniences. However, all these are risks inherent to people who opt to live near a live volcano — risks that have now materialised and impacted their lives.
These obstructionists in today’s Opposition forget that local government units are responsible for responding first in the event of a calamity or disaster before the national government takes over. Indeed, former yellow leader Mar Roxas himself knew that. That’s what he was trying to insist as then Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary in that infamous video showing him bullying Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez during a meeting at the height of the disaster caused by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. Roxas back then was forcing Romualdez to admit he was incapable of handling the situation and to explicitly request in writing that the national government take over. Remember, Roxas famously said, “You’re a Romualdez and the President is an Aquino”.
When we criticised BS Aquino in 2013 in the aftermath of the Haiyan supertyphoon disaster, it was after the fact. It was after their incompetence, their lack of preparation against natural calamities, and their slow response to an emergency had become evident. Proof of this is in that infamous video of Roxas. The callousness of Roxas was on exhibit and in the spotlight. Thousands of bodies were already littered around town but he was still being pedantic. He didn’t care. No wonder he lost the Presidential election in 2016 and lost the senatorial election in 2019. The voters did not forget his arrogance in the midst of an enormous crisis.
The Opposition are probably secretly disappointed that things turned out to be under control and their attempts at putting Duterte down had failed once again.",Others
Leni “Look at Me” Robredo is not helping calm Taal evacuees by engaging in PR stunts,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/leni-look-at-me-robredo-is-not-helping-calm-taal-evacuees-by-engaging-in-pr-stunts/,"A picture of “vice president” Leni Robredo holding the sign “Lugaw Leni” during a visit to an evacuation site supposedly to distribute relief goods is making the rounds in social media. If you still don’t see a problem with this, let me spell it out for you. We have the second highest official in the land trying her darnedest to grab attention away from the people who had been displaced by the sudden eruption of Taal volcano south of Manila.
The threat of a bigger explosive eruption still looms in an area that is home to 500,000 people. Yet Robredo continues to sport a face with a silly smile permanently pasted on it. It’s all well and good for Robredo because she does not live in that area and likely applies no skin in the game there beyond her lame PR stunts.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) continues to warn that a more dangerous and more destructive eruption could still be imminent. Robredo’s quaint stunts are distracting people from the important things. All she cares about are her “critics” on social media. Her holding up a prop for the cameras — her now-trending “Lugaw Leni” tag — is evidence that she is putting up a show for them — to troll them, so to speak.
This all leads us to question Robredo’s true intentions in engaging in these activities. Does she aim to actually help and, more importantly, address the risks that all these ordinary people who backdrop her misguided stunts are exposed to? Is she really looking after the long-term well-being of these people?
As of this writing, Charlie Natanauan, Vice Mayor of Talisay, Batangas has been issuing statements that contradict the PHIVOLCS warnings.
Rather than use her influence to counter misinformation like this and direct people’s attention to reliable information calm their fears, and assure them that they are doing the right thing in staying away from the danger zones, Robredo chooses to work on her personal brand like any two-bit social media influencer would.
It’s high time people see past these idiotic spectacles. Robredo, for her part, should change her motto to “Look at me look at me!” It is ironic that the very people who had mislabeled the eruption a “tragedy” are now failing to see a growing risk of real tragedy unfolding before them even as Robredo performs for the cameras.",Others
Typhoon #Ulysses proves that Leni Robredo is no “quiet worker”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/typhoon-ulysses-proves-that-leni-robredo-is-no-quiet-worker/,"How can Leni Robredo hope to be president of the Philippines someday if she keeps acting like a barangay tanod (town sheriff) rushing from one disaster site after another? Presidents are chief executives who oversee and administer initiatives at a national scale. What Robredo is doing is redundant — a job that first responders like real barangay tanods, the police, the military, and the Coast Guard are more qualified and in better positions to do.
Unfortunately for Filipinos, they are being seriously misled by the Yellowtards (the bloc within the Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) into thinking it is only Robredo who is all action in times of crisis. The way the Office of the Vice President (OVP) is being put up as a disaster response agency by Yellowtards is like how Filipinos turned GI jeeps into public transport just after World War II. We know now how that turned out. They clunked along doing the job clumsily but remained totally unfit for purpose.
Fact is, there are many public servants, government agencies, and private individuals and groups doing things. The Yellowtards and Robredo herself insult these quiet workers by making everyone believe that Robredo is doing it all. At a time when Filipinos should be uniting to work towards the interests of the broader public, the Yellowtards, in putting up “vice president” Leni Robredo as the hero above all, continue to sustain the deep divisions within Philippine society. Noted influencer Carlo Ople notes this in a recent tweet…
No matter how many influencers encourage people to be “one nation” in solidarity in dealing with disaster, the reality is that the Philippines is a deeply-divided nation. You see it even in the way the rich live inside walled fortified enclaves patrolled by private armies. You see it in the way the country’s top “thought leaders” are incapable of framing the big issues of national consequence outside of their society’s highly-polarised partisan politics.
What is really baffling is the inability of the Yellowtards to engage in a bit of introspection and help themselves understand why, rather than attract admiration, Robredo instead cops a lot of scorn and ridicule for her efforts. It is because her most influential supporters fawn over her like she is God’s Gift to Typhoon Disaster Response.
With their comrades behaving this way, it’s small wonder that the more sensible supporters of the Opposition like Inquirer columnist Gideon Lasco struggle to inject some perspective into the political chatter.
One can just as easily respond to Mr Lasco with another question; Well who made it all about Leni Robredo to begin with? Why none other than the Yellowtards!
Everyone is doing their part to respond to disasters whenever they strike the Philippines, but it is only the Yellowtards who are making it a self-promotion activity on social media. Indeed, Leni Robredo is like one of those bozos who after one game of paintball act as if they are war vets. Perhaps all the presidential drumming-in she gets from her fandom is starting to get into her head. Perhaps she herself believes that she’d make a better president than current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Well there really is only one way to find out if she can be president. If you Yellowtards truly believe Leni Robredo “deserves” to be president of the Philippines then, by all means, make her your presidential candidate in the coming 2022 elections. Please do that.",Others
Filipino communists missed a big chance to up their “cause” when they criticised Duterte’s VFA cancellation,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/filipino-communists-missed-a-big-chance-to-up-their-cause-when-they-criticised-dutertes-vfa-cancellation/,"The Philippines’ little community of communists will have to decide who the bigger enemy is — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte or America. Looks like famed Filipino communist Renato Reyes already answered that question. Indeed, for years, Reyes and his comrades have been protesting the presence of US troops on Philippine soil. But now that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is threatening to cancel the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United States, they still aren’t happy!
Communist apologists assert that the position they take on the matter of the controversial VFA is “ideological” in nature while, they claim, Duterte’s is a mere kneejerk response. It seems, however, that this ideological underpinning is out of step with what the majority perceive. This is evident in how the communists continue to lose credibility and political capital at a time when even the smallest gain in PR mileage is important to go up against a massively popular incumbent.
It is actually strange that Reyes would take an antagonistic position on the matter considering that his comrades had long espoused independence from a former colonial master — a stand, interestingly enough, their nemesis Malacanang spokesman Salvador Panelo reportedly takes.
The United States “cannot dictate or bully us into releasing a citizen of this country who is lawfully detained,” Panelo said.
Indeed, one of the key aspects of the VFA that makes communists and the circle of “woke” Opposition partisans who selectively orbit them bristle is a clause that “allows the US government to retain jurisdiction over its military personnel accused of committing crimes in the Philippines.” This was a clause invoked recently in the arrest and detention of US Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton in 2014.
Evidently, there is a root cause behind why Filipino communists struggle to capture the sentiments of voters. Indeed, they need to recognise that when one is up against a massively popular opponent, sticking to an obsolete approach to winning elections seems nothing short of political suicide. The success metric in a democracy, popularity, is straightforward as a means of measuring how effective a politician or party is at acquiring power. People can speak about ideology ’til the cows come home but, suffice to say, if it ain’t popular, you don’t win.
All this is in assuming that the communists’ plan to achieve their objectives involves working within the frame of the law. Big assumption right there. Communists have long sought to overthrow legitimate governments violently and install their so-called “dictatorship of the proletariat”. This objective is justified by the position they take that democracy is a flawed system that sustains a parasitical oligarch class. Fair enough. However, if these commies think democracy is flawed as a means to achieve what is “fair”, then they will have to decide whether to continue participating in it or engaging in their “revolution” instead. It is when they are seen to be doing  both simultaneously, that they lose credibility.
Ultimately communists fail in making their message resonate with the Filipino public because of the inherent inconsistency of their belief system. With every ill-thought-out statement made by old-guard “thought leaders” like Renato Reyes, they lose their “fight” to achieve their dishonest objectives.",Others
"During the typhoons, Leni Robredo tried to make like John McClane of “Die Hard” and FAILED",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/during-the-typhoons-leni-robredo-tried-to-make-like-john-mclane-of-die-hard-and-failed/,"Philippine “vice president” seems to have learnt nothing from what is an ever-lengthening history of botched PR jobs surrounding her personal brand. The recent debacle she finds herself in — being seen to be a self-promoting, camera-hogging, commander-in-chief wannabe during and after this year’s wave of typhoons — is the outcome of yet another dishonest media campaign mounted by her halfwit handlers.
This campaign — amplified and cheered on by her legions of rabid social media “influencers” — contained the usual peppering of “candid” photos and one-line sound bytes as Robredo engaged in various “relief” activities. What was particularly disturbing, however, was how Robredo presumed to “coordinate” the activities of the Philippine military and Coast Guard — as if she were part of the chain of command or, worse, the Commander-in-Chief herself. The crooked strategy of this media campaign was to exploit the perception that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was nowhere to be found in those times of crises and, as such, a perfect opportunity for the “vice president” to step up and fill that media-manufactured leadership “void”. In so doing, Robredo (and her mob) fancied herself as the only government official who was “doing something” and, even more bizarre, the only one who knew what she was doing.
The PR strategy reads almost like the plot of the 1988 film Die Hard where lead character John McClane (played by Bruce Willis) went about single-handedly saving the day, evidently smarter and savvier than all the police, FBI, and CIA combined. It would have worked in a time when Filipinos still got all their news, information, and entertainment from mainstream media channels. With a Philippine mainstream news media industry biased towards the agendas of the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan), this whole Leni Robredo Show would have all been lapped up by an utterly-misinformed public. Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, Filipinos now know better than to trust these crooked organisations. Indeed, there is even a conflict-of-interest at work here seeing how both former and current employees and contracted “talent” of discredited media business ABS-CBN were attempting to correlate the loss of their employer’s broadcasting franchise to the plight of the disaster victims.
Meanwhile, largely unseen, uncelebrated, and beavering away with little fanfare in the background were the various state agencies that oversee the bigger picture as far as the practice of disaster preparedness and disaster response is concerned. The job of a chief executive is to ensure that these agencies work together not just during but before and after disaster strikes. The job of an executive is in the leading and managing and not in the doing.
If Robredo aspires to be chief executive, she should exhibit a similar confidence in being able to work outside of the limelight and focus on getting real macro results quietly. What Robredo exhibits instead is a penchant for the renowned tingi (piecemeal) approach old-school Filipinos apply to dealing with challenges of national consequence. The irony that flies over Robredo’s pointed head is in how, for such small “achievements”, she and her girls blow such loud trumpets. Filipinos deserve something better than this shrill “opposition”. They deserve a more intelligent one focused on quiet achievement.",Others
Leni Robredo’s statements add to the Filipino people’s misery,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/leni-robredos-statements-add-to-the-filipino-peoples-misery/,"Every day it seems like current Vice President Leni Robredo issues dumb statements to the media.

Robredo and the rest of the Opposition think money is the answer to their problems. First of all, Robredo doesn’t have concrete evidence that the current government runs a “well oiled trolling machinery”. She makes it look like there is a Charlie and the Troll Factory somewhere working for the Duterte government. The claim is so ridiculous. Besides, even if they had the funds to operate a troll machine, the Opposition still won’t win. They couldn’t win the 2016 elections, for example, despite being in power and having the funds to pay “trolls”. Even when they hired so-called “influencers”, they still lost. So no, funds or no funds, Robredo and her supporters are no match against facts.
Robredo’s regular issuance of such useless statements is not helping the Filipino community at all. She is adding to their daily misery. In the same press conference, she advised the government to start the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the Taal Volcano eruption here: “Robredo says in an interview that government should start rehabilitation plans for areas affected by Taal Volcano’s unrest even though relief efforts are ongoing”.

She obviously didn’t think first before opening her mouth. The area is still a no-go zone and authorities hadn’t lifted the highest alert warning. As of this writing there was still an imminent threat of another more destructive eruption so there was no point in starting the rehabilitation then. Robredo wanted to project an image that she has all the great ideas but ends up coming across like an airhead.
Robredo also issued another head-scratcher while speaking before the members of the Rotary Club. In front of business men, she expresses “concern” about how the government treats contracts with private enterprises. She said it is “worrying how contracts are now being relegated to the background because that will affect integrity of our contracts.” Someone should remind Robredo that she is part of the government. She should be discussing her concerns with her fellow colleagues and not with businessmen. She is trying to create a negative impression of President Duterte with them just to lift her own profile. In short, she is badmouthing her boss.
Robredo is obviously referring to the government’s contract with water concessionaire Maynilad. She doesn’t even care that Duterte’s beef with the owners of Maynilad has a lot to do with how the contract was allegedly skewed favourably to the owners who don’t even provide excellent service to the people. It’s baffling the way Robredo would defend the owners of these companies instead of the people. Robredo seems to be working for the oligarchs who have been scamming the people. Indeed, in yet another statement, Robredo said she will prioritise the strengthening of the country’s institutions if elected to the Presidency. That may sound heroic to some people but she should know that the padrino system or patronage politics trumps all systems in the Philippines.
As long as she favours the interests of members of the oligarchy — which her own party mates are a part of — Leni Robredo will only contribute to the weakening of already fragile institutions. Besides, as long as the alleged fraud that resulted in her win in the 2016 Vice Presidential election doesn’t get resolved and the fraudsters get away with their crime, democracy in the Philippines will remain a sham.",Others
Nobel + Corona + Virus: The best way to remember PNoy’s twisted legacy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/nobel-corona-virus-the-best-way-to-remember-pnoys-twisted-legacy/,"January 25 is a day that’s indelibly seared like that by a branding iron into the brain of former President Noynoy/Pnoy Aquino. It was the special day of his mother Cory (born on Jan 25, 1933) who then passed away at just the right moment in time for him to be catapulted via Yellow necro-political playbook to the much-coveted national throne. It was also the day (Jan 25, 2015) PNoy sent the SAF44 to their fateful end, which then eventually sealed the complete downfall of his Yellow empire.
The Dilawans will always remind us in anti-ML rallies to “Never Forget”; thus we should apply their admonition circumspectly. Let us also never forget the twisted legacy of arguably the most incompetent and most self-indulgent presidency that ever graced the Philippine political arena.
How better can we be reminded of the “accomplishments” of the past regime than with a convenient acronym that is all over the news these days: nCoV!!! ?
n – for Nobel Prize recipient wannabe. PNoy was probably so addicted to his grand delusion of someday winning the Nobel Peace prize for being the leader who “ended the decades long Muslim insurgency in the South”, that he was willing to sacrifice 44 of the country’s finest commandos for his dream. He would not lift a finger to even send out rescue reinforcements to the embattled heroes that day in Mamasapano – so he just waited it out while his key officers listened to the pleas and calls for help – to no avail, till … radio silence.
Co – for CJ Corona. Gloria-appointed Chief Justice Renato Corona found himself at the center of Pnoy’s rabid all-out-war and relentless campaign to oust the man behind the Cojuangco’s prized Hacienda Luisita being given back to the farmers who tilled the land. For this noble act leading to their family wealth being torn from them, PNoy was probably so fuming enraged at CJ Corona he was willing to move heaven and earth just to impeach the poor guy. Massive illegal DAP/PDAF pork barrel funds were showered upon Senators to bribe them into submission on handing down that “inaccurate SALN” guilty verdict. It was akin to sending to death row a man caught jaywalking.
V – for the yellow Virus behind the contagion/epidemic that swept the country for 3 long decades, earning us the moniker “Sick Man of Asia.” This virus gave those who got infected severe symptoms of incompetence, anti-intellectualism, leadership devoid of vision/strategy, and self-serving politics in the guise of “public welfare for the masses.” Viral as it was upon Cory’s rise to power through EDSA’s PPR, it was all a sham, hollow, hypocrisy-infested political movement. The type that will support the establishment of the CPP-NPA insurgency just to bring down a strongman. But finally, PNoy’s incompetent and lazy governance showed the true color of this damaging virus – that of puke-inducing crap, phlegm, and pus. Through the last Yellow prince, Filipinos have now snapped out of the spell. Salamat PNoy! .. sa kalayaan mula sa kadilawan.
The utter disgrace of the Otso Deretso Yellow-turned-White Senatorial slate in the recent national elections is solid evidence Filipinos have had enough of this shameless PNoy brand of leadership. It is a legacy marked by failure upon failure upon failure, followed by guess what … even more “pasagasa pa kami sa tren” FAILURE: Luneta Chinese tourist bus hostage crisis/tragedy, Haiyan/Yolanda relief debacle, LRT/MRT breakdown, Dengvaxia vaccine fiasco, unconstitutional DAP/PDAF scam, loss of SCS islets to China, drug dens/command centers in Muntinlupa prison, and most of all the fall of SAF44.
The last tragedy was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Let us hope we will never again have to suffer under the hands of such reckless incompetence, treachery and self-interest in our national leadership. One of his greatest legacies is adding a new word to the Dictionary: “Noynoying.”
After 5 years with not even a single-day prison term in sight for the homicidal ex-president, an article such as this is probably all the justice the SAF44’s loved ones will ever get for the loss of their gallant heroes who paid the ultimate sacrifice simply because Ninoy (your smiling P500-bill traitor) once said… the Filipino (i.e., his quintessentially Yellow son PNoy) is worth dying for.",Others
Reporters Without Borders Lists Duterte Admin As Press Freedom Digital Predator,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/reporters-without-borders-lists-duterte-admin-as-press-freedom-digital-predator/,"I do not necessarily agree with Reporters Without Borders listing of the Philippine government or the Duterte Administration as a press freedom digital predator because of the opposition faced by ABS-CBN’s efforts to renew its legislative franchise.
In fact, I continue to be skeptical of foreign “press organizations” that continue to publish reports and ratings of press freedom in the Philippines based on news reports or even assessments from their associates here in the Philippines.
Human Rights Watch, for example, is an organization I encountered during my work with President Duterte’s Presidential Task Force on Media Security which aided in the pursuit of conviction of those who perpetrated the Maguindanao Massacre. In a number of instances, Human Right Watch’s Caloy Conde was caught several times basing his reports to the foreign press organizations on news reports which he did not himself validate. In a number of instances, his tally of supposed government sanctioned killings were erroneous as it included homicide cases unrelated to the government’s anti illegal drugs drive.
In my mind, I tend to lump organizations like Reporters Without Borders (RSF) with organizations such as Human Rights Watch and others.
It doesn’t help that in its 2020 list of 20 Press Freedom Digital Predators, it makes a bare claim that “call center hubs” are being used in “Disseminating fake or maliciously edited content, and fake memes, conducting targeted harassment campaigns“.
Even more disconcerting is RSF’s claim that “President Duterte’s supporters have launched a campaign to smear and boycott the ABS-CBN radio and TV network with the aim of blocking the renewal of its licence. They have even gone so far as to denounce an imaginary conspiracy by various media outlets to overthrow the president. Cyber-troll armies, which have become big business ever since Duterte’s 2016 election campaign, support and amplify the messages of members of the government with the aim of smearing the media and manipulating public opinion.”
That’s a rather ham-fisted way of going about using RSF in ABS-CBN’s fight to renew its legislative franchise. It’s just too damned lazy.
If I were to read more into RSF’s allegation of call centers being brought to bear against ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal efforts, I would think it would be saying that government resources were being used for a propaganda war against a legitimate privately owned media organization.
That would, in fact, be saying that a privately owned media organization was being illegally penalized  by government using public funds to employ criminal means that would amount to libel.
If RSF were to go about using rigorous and legitimate means to expose what looks like government funded thuggery, it would have to use its Filipino associates to dig into the executive branch’s budget allocations for intelligence as well as communications to find proof that actual call centers or its equivalent in a government set up is being deployed against ABS-CBN.
That would be nearly impossible in the case of intelligence funds but not so for government agencies with hefty communications budgets.
To unmask such an operation, it could use a program to mine and map publicly searchable posts on social media and links on search engines for clues leading to their source or sources.
Eventually, this could lead to identifying social media accounts and websites. But even then, these social media accounts and websites may still be virtually anonymous.
Then again, with persistent sleuthing and perhaps given the enormity of such an operation, there’s bound to be a trip up somewhere.
It could be one or several call center agent coming out into the open to admit to such an operation being perpetrated against ABS-CBN and showing clear evidence of such.
But, until then, this call center theory is another one of those conspiracy theories.
I still maintain though that the overt, rather than covert, means of keeping ABS-CBN from getting its legislative franchise renewed is the one at play here.
On the judicial front, some see the hand of former Supreme Court Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco — whose son Cong. Lord Allan Velasco is supposedly in a term sharing agreement with current House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.
On the legislative front, we see the hand of House Speaker Cayetano who was reported to have admitted to stalling deliberations on bills proposing the grant of ABS-CBN’s legislative franchise.

The dishonest intent in Leni Robredo’s “free shuttle services” to Filipinos in a time of COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/the-dishonest-intent-in-leni-robredos-free-shuttle-services-to-filipinos-in-a-time-of-covid-19-pandemic/,"Every bit of resource thrown into the effort to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is welcome, not the least the “free shuttle services” being deployed by “vice president” Leni Robredo through her office. However, a very important question needs to be asked: Why does Leni Robredo’s name and that of her office need to be prominently-displayed on tarps fastened to these shuttle vehicles? What utility does the information in those tarps serve the public?
Consider for a moment the perspective of the average Filipino commuter. All a public transport patron really needs to know about a public transport vehicle is where it is going and, perhaps, that the service is free. Any information beyond that is nothing but noise.
A basic principle of communication engineering is maximising signal-to-noise ratio in a channel. In the case of a typical public utility vehicle (PUV), the signal is the route information and the noise is all the rest of the decals adorning the vehicle. In much the same way many public buses allow some space to display advertising on its exteriors, one can argue that those tarps signalling Robredo’s “caring” to the public constitute a form of advertising. This raises the question:
What is “vice president” Leni Robredo advertising?
People are likely to be able to work out the answer to that question on their own. The point is, the tarps clearly don’t serve any purpose other than whatever interests Robredo seeks to advertise. Robredo says she want to contribute. Everyone is happy that she does. The difference is, many who do do so quietly. Robredo’s intent in having those tarps adorning her buses is to do so noisily.
If Robredo’s office were sincere about the public service they are delivering, it should be reflected in the way they inform the public about said service. And a key principle in the information business is to not over-inform and minimise noise to enhance the signal. Even with the best of intentions, we do tend to over-inform — providing more information than is needed to get the job done. In this case, those tarps adorning Robredo’s shuttle services clearly do not represent any best intentions — only insidious ones.
In times of crises, citizens need to look to a unified government that is in solidarity with their needs. Dividing government services into brands and cults of personality runs counter to this. There is no value to ordinary people in differentiating government services between one politician or the other. What Filipinos need are government services, PERIOD. They just need to know what that service delivers. In the case of public transport, people just need to know where the damn bus is going before they board it!",Others
Implementing community quarantine in Metro Manila a test-and-learn exercise to manage the spread of COVID-19,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/implementing-community-quarantine-in-metro-manila-a-test-and-learn-exercise-to-manage-the-spread-of-covid-19/,"As much of the Philippines belatedly comes to terms with the enormity of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is, to be fair, important that quick and strong measures be implemented to contain the disease. A Code Red Sub-Level 2 alert has been raised by the Philippine government which when implemented restricts movement out of and into Metro Manila. The GMA New Online report notes that “Duterte urged the people not to panic, follow the orders of government and practice social distancing.” Such measures are, of course, subject to periodic review as more information comes in on how the crisis is playing out. It is, to say the least, unreasonable for critics to be expecting the authorities to get it right the first time. However, it is reasonable to expect government to be better-organised to ensure the right information is sent out to the public at the right times.
There are many scenarios to consider given that data on how the virus is transmitted is coming in trickles and the approaches to dealing with the crisis are, as a result, still in flux. Given that the set of most recommended measures to be taken may change from week to week in the coming months, response time and free flow of information is of the essence. People should not be too precious about their chosen “solution” and minds should be kept open (and partisan lines discarded) to ensure the best interests of all are top of mind. Thus, that the measures currently being taken in Metro Manila are still the subject of debate should not be cause for undue worry.
Manila Times columnist Ben Kritz, for one, points out in his article “Kill the patient to cure the disease” that the manner with which Metro Manila, the Philippines biggest and most economically-significant metropolis, could exacerbate the spread of the disease there which is also now raging across much of the world. Kritz, instead, proposes that people be encouraged to disperse instead to reduce clustering behaviours that are conducive to the spread of disease…
What the government should have considered instead, and it still could be done, is to not “lock down” the metropolis, which tends to concentrate people, but to do what some institutions like the Asian Development Bank have done, and let people disperse. Shut down nonessential government offices, nonessential gatherings, museums and other tourist attractions, perhaps even impose shorter hours on malls and stores, and encourage those that are not necessary to close temporarily. Encourage businesses to organize work-from-home arrangements to whatever extent possible. Limit the number of people coming into the country from overseas, but otherwise let people move around.
The aim, according to Kritz, is to “reduce the concentration of the population in Metro Manila”. This is a particularly important thing to note considering that Metro Manila is, according to a Business Insider report, the most crowded city in the world where, in its poorest areas, “multiple families live in close quarters in makeshift communities”. The report, which was published in 2016, points to the chilling reality that there are really very few options available when disaster strikes an ill-prepared densely-packed megalopolis like Manila. It cites how, “In times of crisis, such as the series of flash floods that struck in 2009, gyms have been repurposed as shelters. But the density doesn’t get relieved, just relocated.”
Indeed, statistics in these times of pandemic mean very little in the Philippines. The enormous number of people residing “informally” (the euphemism for squatting preferred by politicians and “activists”) in Metro Manila’s slums and in the dark nooks and crannies of even its most affluent districts represents an immense statistical blackhole into which data is sucked in but out of which no information of statistical significance comes out. COVID-19 is likely to be but a drop in the cesspool of the Philippines’ vast squatter colonies where a huge variety of diseases had long been already sickening and killing people right under statistical radars.
In this regard, “social distancing” would be as oxymoronic to the average Metro Manila resident as organised public transport. This, plus the fact that even just a two to three percentage point increase in infection rates would likely swamp all of the Philippines’ available public health care and emergency response capabilities. Indeed, even the announcement of a citywide mall sale is enough to throw the entire metropolis into a panic followed by monstrous traffic gridlocks. The Philippines’ largest urban area is like a running engine on the brink of seizing up if not for the occasional drops of oil injected into it to just prevent that from happening. This means that careful thought should always be put in considering measures that could disrupt the flow of goods and services in and out of Metro Manila.
In short, while there is merit in looking to other countries for “best practice” in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, the worst-hit as well as the best-managed cases around the world don’t necessarily have Metro Manila’s more acute problems. It is important that Filipinos reach out to each other instead of succumb to colonial mentalities that have long been habitual comfort zones. The sooner Filipinos and their “thought leaders” realise that this is a problem that requires level heads to prevail over superstitious emotionalism and petty politics, the better the chance that they will see this crisis through.",Others
Mass entertainment in the Philippines should be controlled to prevent further dumbing down of Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/mass-entertainment-in-the-philippines-should-be-controlled-to-prevent-further-dumbing-down-of-filipinos/,"No Filipino will disagree that one of the biggest problems the Philippines faces is the quality of thinking of its populace. This is specially critical in a democratic society where popularity is power and specifically in the Philippines where leaders are elected by popular vote.
What is interesting to note is that the institutions of family and education are often singled out as disproportionately responsible for the sorts of citizens produced by Philippine society. To be fair, it is hard to argue against this. People spend their formative years and acquire much of their values within the families they are raised in and within the schools where they spend most of their waking hours growing up. As such, most of the calls to uplift the quality of the country’s citizenry is directed at families and schools.
Consider though that any initiative to improve something should include getting rid of factors that contribute to degrading it. In the case of people, implementing strategies to make people smarter should include a clear plan to eliminate factors that contribute to dumbing them down. Clearly, the biggest factor in the Philippines that dumbs down Filipinos is the entertainment industry. Something needs to be done about this.
The late Supreme Court Justice Isagani Cruz wrote back in 2006 how serious a threat to national development the Philippine entertainment industry poses in the course of reaping enormous profits from its mediocre products…
The Philippine entertainment industry is not only a vast wasteland, as television has been described in America, but a vicious instrument for the abatement of the nation’s intelligence. The shows it offers for the supposed recreation of the people are generally vulgar and smutty, usually with some little moral lesson inserted to make them look respectable, but offensive nonetheless. On the whole, they are obnoxious and unwholesome and deserve to be trashed.
The indiscriminate audience eagerly laps them up because it has not been taught to be selective and more demanding of better quality shows for their pastime. In fact, the easily satisfied fans have been taught the exact opposite reaction — to accept whatever garbage the industry offers them and, to add insult to their injury, to pay for it too. The leaders of the entertainment industry are supposed to be responsible people but they have evaded their duty to elevate the taste of their mostly unthinking supporters. They have instead cheapened them into a mass of automated individuals whose ultimate joy is to roll up in the aisles at the lewd jokes of potential senators.
Indeed, it does not make sense to fill a pail with water if it has a big hole at its bottom out of which the precious fluid flows to waste. It also does not make sense going to the gym everyday if you feast on sweets, soda, and mounds of rice every meal time.
In other words, Filipinos cannot progress if their minds are stunted by bad movies and bad television. Under this light, it is easy to see that there is cause to apply drastic regulation to the sort of content being pumped out by the Philippines’ big media networks. There is something wrong with a business model that allows easy exploitation of stupidity — a business model that the operators of the top entertainment channels of the Philippines employ with impunity. They are no different to Big Tobacco. Indeed, it took decades before society came to the realisation that smoking was not only uncool but downright deadly. How long will it take for society to come to the same realisation when it comes to the crooked mass entertainment they routinely subject themselves to?
One need look no further than the topics routinely reported in social media “trending topic” reports to see the effect of the intellectual bankruptcy of the Philippines’ entertainment industry.
Indeed, many “thought leaders” look to “fact checking” as the silver bullet to combat the proliferation of “misinformation”. There is, however, strong evidence to show that there is a deeper root cause that needs to be addressed in order to uplift the nation’s thinking faculties. As long as people prefer to live in the fantasy world of batang yagit melodrama, canned laughter, and slapstick humour served to them by their entertainment networks, any amount of “factual” news reporting will neither change the way they think nor enable them to make more sound choices.
Filipinos need help — help in making the right choices and help in selecting what their minds consume. Mass entertainment is the opiate of the Filipino masses. It needs to be severely regulated in order for its ill effects to be mitigated. It is not surprising that media giants like ABS-CBN and the GMA Network often pander to the “cause” of “media freedom”. This is because media freedom is their license to continue feeding Filipinos crap. License is a privilege granted to licensees by authorities that are responsible for ensuring the best interests of the public are upheld in a free market. It’s time the Philippines’ authorities on mass media start doing their jobs.",Others

BI Commissioner Jaime Morente issued the reminder in connection with previous incidents of deportation and exclusion of foreign nationals who took part in protests and mass actions.
“We are sending this warning to avoid a repeat of the cases wherein we had to deport foreign protesters,” he said in a statement.
BI Operations Order SBM-2015-025 prohibits foreigners from engaging in political activities while in the country.
They are barred from “joining, supporting, contributing, or involving themselves in whatever manner in any rally, assembly, or gathering”.
Morente noted that while it is within their policy to welcome foreign visitors, they are also duty-bound to implement the law by deporting foreign protesters.
“Foreigners have no business joining such activities as it is a clear violation of their conditions of stay,” he added.
According to Morente, being a visitor of the country does not give foreigners the political rights and privileges of a Filipino.
“Joining political demonstrations is an utter display of disrespect to the country’s authorities, and is equivalent to meddling in our internal affairs as a sovereign nation,” Morente said.

Kung baga sa na friendzone na manliligaw o sidechick na clingy, di mawala-wala.
Mantakin niyo, bagsak na sa DOH at RITM… eh pilit pa ring pinapasa.
Mapapansin niyong mainit ang mata ko sa STANDARD Q COVID 19 Antigen Test ng SD Biosensor.
Tama lang ito dahil kailangan bantayan ng maigi ang mga naglipanang kung ano anong COVID-19 testing kits at baka malusutan tayo ng mga palpak, eh siguradong siyento por siyentong maraming mapapahamak.
Itong mga testing kits ng SD Biosensor eh may lamat na matindi ang reputasyon sa US at sa di malamang katuwiran, sobrang pilit na pinapalusot para gamitin sa bansa.
Nakakapagtaka lang dahil BAGSAK ang SD Biosensor sa pagsusuri mismo ng Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
Sa isang report na lumabas sa Manila Bulletin, heto ang sinabi:
In a report, the RITM said the antigen test kit only yielded 71 percent sensitivity in its evaluation. WHO recommends a sensitivity rate of not less than 80 percent.
“STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test Kit showed 71.43% sensitivity and 100% specificity among asymptomatic patients as compared to the reference PCR test and 100% specificity among asymptomatic healthy volunteers,” the report read.
Makikita ito mismo sa evaluation report ng RITM.
Kung ganun, ang laking panloloko itong nakalagay sa brochure ng  SD Biosensor kung saan sinasabi nilang 96% ang sensitivity ng mga tests nila. Mukhang ang LAKAS makaloko.
Pero kahit na bagsak sa required na 80 percent sensitivity rate, may pumipipilit pa rin na maipasa ito.
Ayon sa FDA ng Pilipinas:
“Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Tests, such as the ones provided by Abbott and SD Biosensor, have been extensively researched, and are widely used and accepted even by the WHO,” said FDA Director General Dr. Eric Domingo.
“The WHO would not approve SD Biosensor in their EUL if the test did not pass their strict standards and guidelines. They approved it based on several validation tests done in different centers. In the Philippines, the 71.43 percent sensitivity estimate of the RITM (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 55.42-84.28) is not significantly different from their 80 percent requirement,” Domingo said.

Para sa ating mga nag-aral at dumaan sa iskwela, kapag nagkaruon ka ng 74% na marka at 75% ang passing grade… Nangangahulugan na BAGSAK ka.
Nakakalito lang itong pinagsasabi ni Domingo at lalo lang nakapag bigay ng kaba sa mga mamamayan na umaasang walang papalusutin ang FDA na makakapagdulot ng sakit o pinsala sa ating mga mamamayan.
Napakatalim ng mata ng FDA sa iba’t ibang mga bagay, pero dito sa SD Bionsensor na BAGSAK sa 80 percent sensitivity requirement ng RITM.
Dapat siguro dito kay Domingo eh kausapin ang RITM para ibahin nila ang standard nila.
Kayo kaya, kung sabihin ko sa inyo na sa sampung kasama niyo sa jeep o bus eh walo lang ang siguradong walang COVID, sasakay pa rin ba kayo?

"Mga Umaray sa Milk Statement ni Sen. Villar, Sila ang Tunay na Walang Kaluluwang Kapitalista",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/mga-umaray-sa-milk-statement-ni-sen-villar-sila-ang-tunay-na-walang-kaluluwang-kapitalista/,"Waring mga pickpocket na naipit ang daliri o akyat bahay na nahuli sa akto ang asta ng mga nambato ng sari-saring pangungutya kay Senator Cynthia Villar dahil sa pamumuna niya sa Philippine Carabao Center dahil sa mababang produksyon nito ng gatas.
Paano ikanyo?
Imbis na suriing mabuti ang kabuuan ng sinabi ni Senator Villar tungkol sa sobrang hinang produksyon ng gatas at iba pang mga produkto ng agrikultura, sabyang tinuon at pinako ang diskusyon sa pangungutya sa Senador.
Panay character assasination ang ginawa ng mga dilawan at makakaliwang trolls na naglipana sa social media.
Ginawang ulo ng balita ang statement ni Senator Villar tungkol sa produksyon ng gatas at inintriga ng husto para maitago ang mas malamang statement na naglalarawan ng kapalpakan bunga ng kontsabahan ng mga agricultural importer at BULOKrasya ng Department of Agriculture.
Heto ang salitang lumatay sa mga walang kaluluwang kapitalistang mas gustong makitang malnourished ang mga kabtaang Pilipino, malamanan lang ng bilyon-bilyong piso ang mga bank account nila.
Villar also slammed Agriculture officials for focusing on the processing of importation permits instead of “developmental programs” for farmers in the provinces.
“Palagi kayong regulatory. Palaging import permit ang inaasikaso ninyo kasi malaki ang kita sa import permit. Pag import permit busy na busy sila, pero pag developmental wala,” she said.
Department of Agriculture officials present in the hearing did not refute Villar’s outburst, after the senator warned them to stop allocating more funds to office expenditures.
The Philippines has been lagging behind its regional peers in the production of rice, sugar, coconut, and dairy, Villar said, citing data from the Department of Finance.
“Tigilan niyo na ‘yang overhead niyo. Puro kayo overhead [expenses], wala kayong program. Kaya ang sama-sama ng Agriculture natin,” she said.
Lumalabas na MAS KAKAMPI PA NG MGA MAGSASAKA ITONG SI CYNTHIA VILLAR kesa sa mga memang katulad ng humahawak ng Oras Na, Roxas Na Facebook page.
Napaka walang modo naman ng pamumuna ng pahinang Oras Na, Roxas Na sa estilo ng pananalita ni Senator Villar.
Ganun talaga magsalita ang mga TUNAY NA NAKIKISALIMUHA SA MGA ORDINARYONG MGA TAO.
Bata pa po ako, kilala na po ang mga Villar at Aguilar na katuwang ng mga masa sa Las Pinas at Muntinlupa.
Sa kurikong na humahawak ng page ni Roxas, kung ganyang klaseng pambababoy na rin ang gagawin ninyo, wala kayong karapatang sabihin na disente kayo.
Kung reserts na rin ang pag-uusapan, tandang tanda ko na ang amo niyong si Roxas ang napagtsismisan na nasabon ni dating Pangulong Gloria Macapagal Arroyo nuong nagsisilbi siyang Trade Secretary ng bansa.
Paano ba naman, ang sabi kasi ni Roxas nuon sa harap ng mga media eh mas mabuti pang abandonahin na ang rice production ng Pilipinas at mag-angkat na lang mula sa ibang bansa.
Mas gusto ni Roxas mamatay ng dilat sa gutom ang mga magsasaka, kesa sa ayusin ang mga batas at regulasyon ng bansa na nagpapamahal sa agricultural inputs na nagpapamahal sa pagkain nating mga Pilipino.
Si Roxas ang primero unong protektor ng mga dayuhang kapitalista galing US at Japan, tulad ng lolo niyang si Manuel Acuna Roxas na inuna ang pakikipag deal sa mga Amerikano kesa sa mapalaya ang bansa sa kuko ng Amerika.
Kaya nga ayos lang sa kanya ang pag-aangkat ng bigas at iba pang agricultural goods mula sa mga bansang binabagsakan ng US at Japan ng tulong.
Hahaaaay!
O, ngayong binisto ni Senator Villar ang kagawian ng mga kapitalistang agricultural importer na kachokaran nila Roxas, todo naman ang tirada nila.

Pasig City mayor Vico Sotto should just do his job without the fanfare and the grandstanding,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/pasig-city-mayor-vico-sotto-should-just-do-his-job-without-the-fanfare-and-the-grandstanding/,"The whole debate surrounding Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto has nothing to do with the quality of his governance. That too, nonetheless, is debatable but is better off left to another article for another day. Here we will discuss the trouble with the disproportionate amount of media exposure Sotto is getting.
Vico Sotto is making waves because he targets an easy space in the political chatter — “for the people” sloganeering. This is classic Philippine political posturing and the reason why squatters and jeepneys continue to infest the Philippines’ biggest cities. “For the people” rhetoric is a compelling emotional blackmail that most Filipino “thought leaders” are intellectually ill-equipped to argue against. This coupled with a penchant for playing to the media (and, the media, playing to his performance) makes for a potent public relations (PR) machine.
Debatable as to why Sotto attracts all this attention may be, the fact is, Vico Sotto is a member of a powerful entertainment and media clan. This fact alone makes the amount of exposure accorded to him suspect. Even the Yellowtards (the dominant Opposition bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) recognise the favourite Filipino word that encapsulates the underlying theme here — delicadeza. Roughly translated, the word refers to the notion of inhibiting from a situation where one is at risk of being embroiled in a conflict of interest.
It is therefore easy to see why media would favour Sotto when allocating expensive air time. Though debatable that they consciously do so, the argument that their business model (maximising viewership to maximise ad revenue) predisposes them to that end is very compelling. In that alone, it can be concluded that Vico Sotto enjoys an unfair advantage over other politicians considering that elections are won and lost on the back of the whims and favours of Big Corporate Media.
Even more subtle is the idea of quiet achievement — something that is far more likely to fly way above Filipinos’ and their thought leaders’ heads than Sotto’s media conflict-of-interest angle. Celebrating a politician who celebrates himself in collusion with the media is just not classy. Understandably, Sotto’s youth makes him a part of the Selfie Generation — an entire demographic that came to age regarding just about every minutiae of every minute in one’s life as a media event.
Perhaps Vico Sotto should consider a simple principle of professional public administration: More public service and less public relations.
A true achiever’s work speaks for itself. The true test of how well Sotto performs as a government official will ultimately lie in his ability to show lasting outcomes from his work. Will his legacy be in that lasting work? Or will it be in mere archived video footage and social media footprints (such as Twitter hashtags and mentions of his name) alone? A true public servants builds things that outlast his or her term of office. Sotto’s posturings captured on video and news reports may outlast his term. But it remains to be seen whether what he is doing for Pasig City will be as enduring.",Others
"ABS-CBN’s Shutdown, A Diabolical Interpretation of Law",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abs-cbns-shutdown-a-diabolical-interpretation-of-law/,"People in this small corner of the internet can paint ABS-CBN all sorts of yellow and have the network of expert Duterte supporters make it go viral, but it will not diminish the truth that what the broadcast network succumbed to was a perverted, diabolical interpretation of law implemented by an army of expert brown-nosers.
We all know that Presidente Rodrigo Duterte has an axe to grind against ABS-CBN and those seeking his good graces are falling all over themselves trying to score bigtime brownie points by doing the broadcast network in.
Several leaders allied of the House of Representatives to President Duterte stalled hearings on bills seeking its legislative franchise.
Then the Office of the Solicitor General went out of its way to file a Quo Warranto petition against ABS-CBN which many legal luminaries viewed as an over extension of its powers.
AND NOW WE have the National Telecommunications Commission going out of its way to issue a cease and desist order AFTER IT HAD ASSURED THE BROADCAST NETWORK’S CONTINUED OPERATION  in February this year.
Never once in the history of the NTC has it ever blocked the operation of any broadcaster whose Congressional Franchise had lapsed and awaited renewal.
Why now? Why ONLY with ABS-CBN?
NTC commissioners have justified this latest Cease and Desist Order (CDO) against ABS-CBN as a move recommended by their legal department. They claim that, in their view, it would be illegal for ABS-CBN to operate and for the regulator to extend any provisional permit to operate because the franchise had lapsed.
Simply put, no franchise, no operation.
This despite the fact that the franchise renewal is being heard in the House of Representatives and soon after in the Senate.
Previously, in the Senate Public Services Committee hearing last February 24, 2020, NTC Commissioner Gamaliel Cordoba testified under oath that indeed the regulator had allowed such practice of allowing broadcasters and telecommunications companies to operate despite their franchises having lapsed multiple times in the past.
“Mayroon po kasing mga cases before where nangyari po ay while the legislative process ay umaandar ay nagkaroon po nang pag-end or pag-lapse noong franchise sa mga pending committee bills, for example, of franchises ay tumuloy naman po ito,” Cordoba was recorded as saying.
Cordoba confirmed the various cases detailed by committee chair Senator Grace Poe of lapsed franchises allowed by NTC to operate including TV5, GMA 7, the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of the Philippines and others.
“Sa GMA franchise, March 20, 2017 ang expiration date pero ito ay napirmahan ng April 21, 2017, so nag-lapse rin,” Poe pointed out.
“TV5, ganoon din, December 2018 pero napirmahan ng April 2019; CBCP, nagtapos ng 2017 pero pinirmahan ng 2019, dalawang taon iyon; Subic Broadcasting, nagtapos ng 2017 napirmahan ng 2018; Radio Marine Network, nagtapos ng 2018 pero pinirmahan pa ng 2019; Smart Communications, nagtapos ng 2017 ng March pero pinirmahan ng April 2017; Globe Innove, April 10, 2017 nag-expire pero napirmahan ang kanilang prangkisa December 14, 2018; PT&T, nag- expire ng 2015 pero nag-lapse into law ng 2016.”
Cordoba however turned to Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, whose legal opinion he said he is seeking because the Department of Justice (DOJ) is government’s and his agency’s primary legal counsel.
In the same hearing Guevarra pointed out that there is a gap in the law that does not define what happens in case of pending renewal applications in congress, thus a legal principle of “equity” comes into play to fill that gap.
“Equity is the principle by which substantial justice may be a thing in cases where the prescribed or customary forms of ordinary law are inadequate,” Guevarra pointed out in the Senate hearing.
“Considerations of equity have apparently been applied in previous similar situations presented earlier namely, among others, PT&T, SMART Communications, Incorporated, Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, Incorporation. All of whom were allowed to operate despite expired franchises as long as the application for the renewal of these franchises were lodged with the Congress before the lapse of their term.”
Guevarra further stated that “Congress may authorize the National Telecommunications Commission to issue a provisional authority, subject to such terms and conditions as the NTC may deem fit, to ABS-CBN, and other entities who are similarly situated, authorizing them to continue operating subject to the Congress’s eventual disposition of their renewal applications.”
Both the House of representatives and the Senate had written the NTC to grant ABS-CBN the provisional authority while the franchise renewal is being heard which Cordoba confirmed was adequate.
“Kung ang Senado ang magbigay ng request sa inyo?” Poe asked Cordoba during the hearing, to which he replied: “Then I guess we have basis to do that (grant provisional authority).” Last March 11 2020 went so far as to say that it would allow ABS-CBN up to June 2022 to operate while the current Congress is in session deliberating the station’s franchise renewal after receiving the joint resolutions of both Houses of Congress. NTC Deputy Commissioner Edgario Cabarios publicly announced the issuance of the temporary permit.
Moreover, Anakalusugan Party List Representative Michael Defensor drives home an even more crucial point:
There are members of Congress who find it convenient to agree with the opinion of the Solicitor General and the Presidential Legal Counsel that puts the blame on the House of Representatives for the expiration of the franchise of ABS-CBN.
Frankly, I am baffled by this sentiment.
In the first place, and I say this as the representative of the Anakalusugan Partylist whose main advocacy is the health and welfare of the Filipino people, Congress should be tackling more important issues, instead of a private bill that has been languishing in these chambers for the past two administrations.
This is especially true today as we face a worldwide pandemic that has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands around the world. Yet here we are.
Wasting valuable time – all because a few rogue administration officials have taken it upon themselves to subvert the process for their own political ends.
Before we went on recess, the House leadership had already sought – and secured – a consensus among the Senate, the Department of Justice, and the NTC on how to proceed with the franchise hearings.
The commitments given by Commissioner Cordoba were clear and unconditional – they will allow ABS-CBN to continue broadcasting until the application is decided upon.
Then two days before Congress opened the SolGen threatened the NTC with legal action should they complied with their promise.
Still, having full confidence in the DOJ opinion and the NTC’s assurances, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano spoke to the media and assured them that Congress had no intention to close the network without prior due process – including a fair and impartial hearing.
Yesterday Congress was ambushed.
And if we may believe the statements of Sec. Harry Roque, this also caught Malacañang by surprise.
The unconstitutional meddling of the SolGen – to the extent that he pressured the NTC to go against the DOJ, the Senate, and their own word given under oath – is a disgrace and an affront to the entire Congress.
Yet there are still those among us who choose to side with them against the rest of the membership.",Others
Leni Robredo keeps proving what a big FAKE she is,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/leni-robredo-keeps-proving-what-a-big-fake-she-is/,"If there is something current “vice president” Leni Robredo has so far proven, it is that she is a good performer. Her most recent PR stunt in which she delivered her “recommendations” on ways to improve the “fight” versus the coronavirus came across as a pretty competent stage act that left her fans gushing. Unfortunately, all it really proved is that Robredo can read but not necessarily lead.
After all, she went into what seemed to be the finer details around “restarting the economy”, “budget utilisation”, and “reporting of data” — fields of expertise that clearly go way beyond her known expertise in the fields of “human rights” lawyering. Indeed, considering that she delves into fields that vex even the most competent of administrators in these times of COVID-19 pandemic, it seems pretty premature or too much of a jumping-of-the-gun to be praising evidently scripted words coming from a “vice president” who could barely string together a sentence in straight English.
In mounting these quaint stunts, Robredo plays into an easy — even exploitative — space. Filipinos are renowned for their inability to tell the difference between the fictious character played by an actor on TV and in the movies and the actual real-life character of said actor. This is the reason many actors make it big in Philippine politics. Look no further than the likes of Senators Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla, among others, not to mention Joseph “Erap” Estrada who actually bagged the presidency in 1998 and Fernando “Ang Panday” Poe Jr who came disturbingly close to achieving the same in 2004. As such, the manner with which even the top Opposition “thought leaders” latch on to someone like Robredo who has no proven track record in executive leadership nor, at the very least, administration comes across as a bit daft.
Reading off a script certainly does not prove much. For that matter, the shape-shifter style with which Robredo transformed from one persona to another over the course of her public life from the time she started her campaign in the lead up to the 2016 elections to the present has got PR written all over it. When one does not have a stable political platform upon which to deliver one’s messaging to one’s constituents and, instead, relies on prompts from PR consultants, one tends to simply bob up and down on a sea of public opinion and, as such, come across as pathetically inconsistent.
There is a place for PR-driven public messaging and that is during election campaigns. Robredo has obviously not matured beyond the same campaign-mode her rabidly partisan followers seem to expect her to sustain. This is not appropriate given that she has been warming the “vice president” seat for the past four years now and is part of the government she presumably contributes her ideas to. If her supporters see the media stunt-like manner with which Robredo trumpets her “recommendations” as a successful indictment of the Philippine government’s efforts to do its job, she is on the hook to correct that perception if one assumes that she delivers these recommendations not to make her government look bad but to genuinely contribute to its success.
The question to Robredo therefore is, what is the real intent of her delivering her recommendations to the media first rather than to her own government in the first instance? The answer to that question is what will ultimately be the real test of whether Leni Robredo is fit to lead the Filipino people. Evidently being able to read alone just doesn’t cut it.",Others
COVID-19 reveals how too much “dissent” weakened our ability to respond to pandemic,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/covid-19-reveals-how-too-much-dissent-weakened-our-ability-to-respond-to-pandemic/,"The COVID-19 outbreak has brought to the fore the importance of a government’s ability to keep track of and act on data collected related to its citizens’ movements. In the Philippines, decades of a liberal narrative — specifically the rabid one espoused by the “Yellowtard” bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan — that demonised the police and railed against “authoritarianism” had undermined this capability. A national response to the pandemic now gripping the world requires essential state oversight; a reliable identification system, centralised communications and information dissemination, and swift decision-making where necessary. However, noise created by the Yellowtards amplifying their “Big Brother is Watching” fear-mongering against IDs, their “press freedom” that adds panic-inducing shrillness to public chatter, and “dissent” for the sake of “dissent” brand of “activism” remains a constant setback.
The underlying issue here is trust. In societies where the citizenry are trustful of their government, a broad community response can be mobilised relatively quickly. In low-trust societies like the Philippines, unproductive “debate” tends to trump all sensible action beyond any hope of redemption. This situation is readily-evident in the way Filipinos respond not just to the COVID-19 pandemic but to most crises overall. Granted, the Philippine Government, like most before it, continues to suffer from a crisis of credibility. This is not helped by the persistent “revolution”, “protest”, and “dissent” rhetoric of the Yellowtards and communists both of which harbour a dishonest aim to incite rebellion against any government they perceive to be at odds with the status quo they had become comfy with following the 1986 EDSA “Revolution”.
Crisis situations necessitate less tolerance for second-guessing in much the same way that there can only be one driver (and not a committee of them) making critical decisions during a high-speed car chase. This is the reason military organisations are not democracies. The Opposition should position themselves as one that seeks to work with the government in this time of crisis and then, at the appropriate time, incorporate lessons learned from the experience into their campaign platform.
Note emphasis on making a pitch to the public at the appropriate time. This punctuates the key point here — the midst of a crisis is not the appropriate time to be overly-critical much less posture in the obstructionist way today’s Opposition habitually do. It also does not help engaging in stunts that seek to erode trust in the government. This is not to say genuine dissent should be quashed. What should be frowned upon and categorically stopped is dishonest “dissent” — the types that seek to push insidious agendas. The Yellowtard approach to “dissent” has primarily been of the dishonest sort — a perception they framed within their “freedom” to “disagree” but motivated more by a desire to tear down rather than build for the sole purpose of seizing power even by illegal means. In short, the Opposition “dissent” is focused on blocking the incumbent way without offering alternative pathways the way a true and genuine opposition would. The main card they play is the “Evil Martial Law Regime” card which they never hesitate to slap on the table whenever they catch wind of any hint of what they perceive to be “authoritarian” measures being cooked up.
An example of the dishonesty of this “dissent” specifically of so-called “leftist” elements is in how they oppose the implementation of what is now a much-needed national ID system insisting that such a proposal is “anti-democratic” and such measures would be “in blatant disregard of the Philippine Supreme Court’s ruling that such a policy would be out-right unconstitutional”.
However, Artemio Panganiban disagrees and points out in his column on today’s edition of the Inquirer that such measures in their current proposed form in Republic Act 11055 “will pass constitutional scrutiny” and that “[the] ‘leftists’ whom President Duterte blamed on national TV-radio last Monday will, I think, fail in their opposition to the PhilID.” He further writes…
These simple personal data are already publicly disclosed in drivers’ licenses, passports, senior ID cards as well as in ID cards issued by the Social Security System (SSS) and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).
Filipinos only need to take up the intellectual habit of stepping back from the shrill emotional rhetoric of so-called “activists” and regard the issues with level heads and modern thinking faculties. More importantly, it is high time Filipinos trust their institutional democratic processes and rely less on the screeching “protest” rhetoric of the Yellowtards. In these times of COVID-19 pandemic and, for that matter, any future crises, Filipinos should learn to apply a more mature demeanour in managing their affairs and respond to challenges in a more sober, more stoic manner.",Others
The Philippines needs a strong police and army more than ever,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/the-philippines-needs-a-strong-police-and-army-more-than-ever/,"Terrorists are getting bolder as it becomes ever more pointedly evident that the Opposition (specifically its leading blocs, the communists and the Yellowtards) regard demonisation of the police and the military as cornerstones of their sick ideologies. Indeed, Filipinos have long suspected strong links between the Yellowtards (the bloc of rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists seeing how, back in the 1980s, the late former President Cory Aquino upon grabbing power made it one of her top priorities to release key communist leaders from prison. Both camps habitually push for extra-constitutional — basically criminal — approaches to changes in leadership as well as paint Filipinos as chronic victims of circumstances that are, in actual fact, of their own making.
This habitual painting of the army and police under a bad light by the current Opposition traces its roots to the “Martial Law” rhetoric that bred an entire generation of Martial Law Crybabies and three decades of the ensuing crybabyism dominating the national political narrative. It did not seem to occur to these partisans that a strong nation that lives by the rule of law is made possible by a strong military and a world-class police force. Now, nobody is saying that the Philippines’ military and police are perfect, but demonising them never was a solution to those gaps. The key lay in recommending solutions and charting a pathway forward to achieving a desired outcome. Sadly the Yellowtards chose a destructive approach instead, anchoring their thinking on the past and launching their demonisation campaign. Both this fixation on the past and this repeated slander of the police and military have since become their trademark position. The only real beneficiaries of such a shortsighted campaign were the communists and other organisations that rely on terrorism as a pillar of their strategic agendas.
We now see the results of decades of withering assault on the country’s state forces mounted by the Yellowtards and communists. The Philippines’ military and police forces are weak and underdeveloped, routinely disrespected, and woefully underfunded. The fact that the country’s elite cocoon themselves within fortified gated communities and that private security is a billion-peso industry in the Philippines are testaments to the flaccid state of the country’s police and armed forces. The Yellowtards together with the communists in cahoots with the Philippines’ mass media industry (including virtually all of university campus “journalism”) have effectively created an environment that not only breeds but coddles terrorists. It has also created a sissy culture where victimisation is a key criterion to being regarded as a “hero”, where dead relatives are made platforms upon which dishonest political careers are launched, and where being a sissy is regarded as a “woke” virtue.
Filipinos need to put an end to the sissy culture being propagated by the Yellowtards and the communists. Look at all the world’s greatest nations. They are nations built by the sword and have blood-soaked histories of conquest and warfare. That the Philippines has no history of ever having won a war and, for that matter, altogether lacks any semblance of a martial tradition says a lot about its national character. Clearly, the Yellowtards and the communists are roadblocks to greatness. It’s time the Filipinos take decisive action against these cultural and political cancers that seek to embed defeatist mindsets and breed sheep-like people.",Others
Dapat Matyagan ng NBI Ang Troll Accounts Na Umaatake Sa Mayor ng Rodriguez Rizal,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/dapat-matyagan-ng-nbi-ang-troll-accounts-na-umaatake-sa-mayor-ng-rodriguez-rizal/,"Matutulog na lang ako kagabi may nag-message sa aking Facebook page na naka-link dito sa author account ko sa Get Real Philippines. Mukhang may galit sa akin dahil sa naunang blog ko kung saan pinuna ko lang naman ang pagkakulang sa balanse ng report ni Maki Pulido.
Ang sabi ng nag-message mula kay Chris P. Chicken na obvious na fake account (dahil malamang nag-aalangan gamitin ang tutoong mukha at pangalan): “Ikaw pala ang writer ng balanseng article na nato (.) hintayin mo comeback mo sa pagsusulat ng puro maling impormasyon at pagtatanggol ng government ng rodriguez. May diyos at malakas ang karma tandaan mo yan.”
Usually, di ko na binibigyang pansin ang mga ganitong mensahe at komento. Kung sa opinion niya mali ako, okay lang. Opinion niya yun at nire-respeto ko yan. Apir!
Pero natimbrehan ako ng iba ko pang mga followers at nagsumbong sila sa akin na may nag-share ng blog ko sa isang Facebook group na taga MONTALBAN kami (tMk).  (FYI Montalban ang dating pangalan ng bayan ng Rodriguez.)
Sa grupong ito, parang pinutakte ng comments ang blog ko at parang iisa lang ang script ng mga comment: “Hindi nagpapakita si Mayor” or “Wala si Mayor”
Imposible naman na wala si Mayor lagi sa bayan at zero talaga ang ginawa niya sa bayan ng Rodriguez. Kung tutoo man ito, malamang na-report na ito sa DILG at the very least.
Kaya tinignan ko isa-isa ang mga accounts na nag-comment para makilatis kung tutoong mga accounts ba ito na naghahayag lang ng honest opinion.
Kaso yung ilan, ang nakalagay na location tinitirahan eh Manila o Quezon City — akala ko ba taga Montalban sila?
Yung iba naman, mistulang FB account na ginagamit na pang-share ng kung ano anong mga links. Yung iba pa, nitong buwan lang na ito naging aktibo base sa mga public posts. Yung iba pa, halos walang mga pang personal na posts tulad ng makikita kapag New Year o Christmas o kung meron man, wala itong mga reactions o comments ng mga kamag-anak o kaibigan.
May kutob ako na either fake FB account ang mga ito kung hindi mga tutoong FB account na nabili o hiniram para magamit na pang post o pang comment sa mga FB groups.
Ito yung tipo ng mga accounts na ginagamit para makapag kumbinsi ng mga nasa FB group para umayon sa isang pananaw o para i-up ang mga posts para mapansin ng lahat ng nasa grupo.
Di ko inaalis ang posiblidad na mayroon talagang mga tutoong FB account na nadala ng mga negatibong mga comments at nakisali na sa pag-comment ng negatibo laban sa mayor.
In anycase, mukhang ang objective ng mga comments na ito eh masabing di ginagampanan ng Mayor ng Rodriguez ang kanyang tungkulin.
Naisip ko rin na baka ang objective nito eh ilarawan na natutulog sa pansitan si Mayor Tom Hernandez para magalit ng husto ang mga taga Rodriguez, makaabot ito kay Pangulong Duterte at matanggal sa pwesto si Mayor Tom Hernandez.
Bukod diyan, hinala ko na baka parte na ito ng isang operation na ang objective eh guluhin ang bayan ng Rodriguez.
Di malayo itong magamit na oportunidad ng mga pwersang kalaban ng gobyerno na makapaghasik ng lagim, diba?
Sa dami ng mga taong nasa class D at class E sa Rodriguez, madali-dali rin silang mahikayat na mag-alsa at kung ganun ang mangyayari, maaaring humantong sa napaka delikadong sitwasyon na pwedeng pumilay sa National Government.
Kaya ngayon pa lamang dapat na talagang tutukan ng NBI at maging ng National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) itong nangyayaring troll operations na ito sa Rodriguez.",Others
Philippine FDA Should Move Quicker to Recall Rapid Testing Kits Already Rejected by China,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/philippine-fda-should-move-quicker-to-recall-rapid-testing-kits-already-rejected-by-china/,"Amidst calls for the resignation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque and some controversy surrounding the firing or resignation of IATF special consultant Dr. Tony Leachon, it looks like the country is being flooded with inferior Covid-19 Rapid Testing Kits.
Lower House Health Committee Vice Chairman Cong. Michael T. Defensor is at a loss over the Philippine Food and Drug Administration’s slowness in stopping the sale of Covid Rapid Testing Kits (RTKs) already rejected by their country of origin.
At the same time, Defensor scored the FDA for not coming up with a clear standard for approving Covid RTKs.
“FDA should immediately order a product recall of untested RTK brands and ban their importation to prevent people from wasting their money on these unreliable testing kits. Dapat hindi labo-labo, and hindi dapat kung ano anong brand na lang ang pinayagan ng FDA. Dapat ipaliwanag ng FDA ang batayan ng approval nila,” said Defensor.
Defensor suggested that since it lacks the capacity to test RTK brands, it would be practical to approve the brands endorsed by its counterpart in China, the National Medial Products Administration.

Additional funding for Leni Robredo’s office: a case of REVERSE PORK BARREL,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/additional-funding-for-leni-robredos-office-a-case-of-reverse-pork-barrel/,"Back in the day, pork barrel — known by a variety of euphemisms like “Priority Development Assistance Fund” (PDAF) and most notorious of all, the so-called “Disbursement Acceleration Program” (DAP) — usually involved funds “allocated” by the Executive Branch to legislators. Nowadays we are seeing an even bigger perversion of this crooked accounting sleight of hand. Legislators are now mulling over delivering a similar sort of discretionary funding to the Office of the Vice President (OVP).
The additional funding being considered is enormous. CNN Philippines reports that legislators are considering jacking up the budget of the OVP to one billion pesos — up from just 679 million pesos. And what would this additional funding be used for? According to the same report her office aims to “reach more pandemic-hit Filipinos”.
The OVP previously launched programs which rolled out personal protective equipment, free shuttle services, and dormitories for health workers. It also purchased coronavirus test and extraction kits which were delivered to various private and state laboratories.
Robredo’s office also recently launched the “Bayanihanapbuhay” platform to help Filipinos look for job opportunities online. For its second leg, they will launch within the week another initiative to provide opportunities for those from the micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs which earlier benefited from her anti-poverty program Angat Buhay.
Who can argue with that bit of emotional blackmail, right? But if we stop to think about this even for a minute, we will find that these are activities that fall within the remits of existing government departments and agencies such as the Departments of Social Welfare and Development, Public Works and Highways, and Health among others. One wonders then why the OVP sees itself as obliged to do jobs that are the responsibilities of other offices; considering too that these respective agencies and departments possess the in-house experience, expertise, and specialist resources to do these jobs properly and at scales that allow procurement and use of these resources efficiently.
The more important and more disturbing aspect of these sketchy budgetary wranglings is the track record of “vice president” Leni Robredo exhibits using such “services” she delivers to the public as platforms for engaging in partisan posturing and bolstering her public profile. Robredo, after all, is seen to be the “leader” of the Philippine Opposition and with national elections just around the corner, it is quite evident she is out for a bit of self-promotion on the state dime.
If it walks like pork barrel, quacks like pork barrel, and looks like pork barrel then, guess what: It very likely is pork barrel. The only difference is the gravy is flowing the other way this time — from the Legislative Branch to the Executive Branch contrary to tradition.
It is well and good that Robredo is using her office as a conduit for these “public services”. What is not clear, however, are her motives and agenda seeing that Robredo wastes no opportunity to make delivery of these “services” a big song-and-dance before the cameras of ABS-CBN, Rappler, and, of course the Inquirer. It is easy to see that this just does not make any sense as evident in the sophomoric logic her supporters use to justify these proposed budget allocations. Robredo ally Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Gabriel Bordado reportedly asserted that “the OVP received the highest audit rating from the Commission on Audit in 2019” which, if one pauses to think about it, really has nothing to do with budget decisions. Bordado insists that the OVP “has been engaging in frontline activities against COVID-19. It has also launched livelihood, education, people empowerment, and other projects throughout the country, but its budget is still the smallest in the entire bureaucracy”. Another non-sequitur. None of the “activities” Bordado cites is part of the scope of work of the OVP.
One can only conclude that the requests for more money to be thrown into the OVP are motivated by dishonest and baldly political intentions. That’s just not right.",Others
Dishonest Philippine Opposition are desperately politicising typhoon #RollyPH!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/dishonest-philippine-opposition-are-desperately-politicising-typhoon-rollyph/,"Just when you thought the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the partisan bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) could not plumb even lower depths in their desperate quest for power, here they are now seizing every opportunity to turn the imminent visit of super-typhoon Goni (code-named “Rolly” in the Philippines) into political gain. As of this writing, Rolly is expected to tear through Metro Manila, the Philippines’ premiere and most populous metropolis after first hitting the country’s East coast Sunday morning.
“Violent winds and intense rainfall” are expected that could trigger floods and landslides in an area of more than 20 million people, the weather service said.
There was a “high risk” of storm surges of more than three metres (10 feet) high along parts of the coast, it added.
At a time when Filipinos need to work together and look out for one another, Yellowtard “thought leaders” are priming the Filipino public to expect atrocious government response to the crisis. This, of course, is a classic political tactic meant to set themselves up for a blame barrage against the government they will likely launch once Rolly does the job they hope it will do.
In this respect, the Opposition play into an easy space. Poverty has rendered millions of Filipinos helplessly vulnerable to nature’s vicissitudes. Many of the tens of thousands of the victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) and Typhoon Washi (Sendong) which struck the Philippine cities of Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro in 2013 and 2011 respectively were impoverished city residents that had settled (many of them illegally) along coastal plains prone to storm surges. Back in 2006, a landslide struck and buried Barangay Guinsaugon in the municipality of St. Bernard in Leyte killing close to 2,000 people. This disaster followed a record 571.2mm of rainfall over five days — three months worth of average rainfall for that region. Fifteen years before that in the city of Ormoc in the same province, 5,000 souls perished in flashflooding and landslides also following heavy rainfall in 1991.
None of these facts seem to bother the Yellowtards. They even insert the plight of their pet mega-rich media conglomerate ABS-CBN into the narrative insisting that the cancellation of its franchise to broadcast this year is certain to spell disaster for the Philippines.
It is also interesting to observe the same partisans sitting around complaining about a lack of any word from the president. This considering that any word issued by the president will, in any case, be met by derision coming from these very same people.
It is plainly evident that members of the Philippine Opposition, most specially that Yellowtard clique that presumes to lead it, are not really looking out for the public good. They are only out to seize any opportunity to paint the Philippine government under a bad light and capitalise on any angle to bolster their quest for power.",Others
Leni Robredo’s dishonesty and grandstanding during disasters is turning Filipino voters off,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/leni-robredos-dishonesty-and-grandstanding-during-disasters-is-turning-filipino-voters-off/,"Current Vice President Leni Robredo is a dishonest person. That needs to be emphasized as a community service. The public needs to know that she has been the bane of Philippine society since she started her stint as the second in the presidential line of succession or a spare tire if we are to be blunt about it. She quite often acts as if she is the President though. She does not care about protocols. She forgets her place in the world order.
Robredo quite often takes a swipe at President Rodrigo Duterte like it is part of her job. She tries very hard to paint the President as uncaring while painting herself as the country’s saviour. The fact is, she is only doing further damage to an already fragmented society by constantly contradicting Duterte’s policies and directives.  We all know she has an axe to grind against Duterte for sacking her twice from his cabinet.  She was sacked for being incompetent and for always talking to the media about her “ideas” before discussing things with other fellow cabinet members. In short, she is not a team player. We knew this would happen since she is a member of the Opposition.
The recent typhoon that devastated parts of the country, particularly Cagayan and Isabela, exposed once again not just the country’s vulnerability to disasters but also Robredo’s penchant for grandstanding. In a show of clockwork-like predictability, she was pictured walking in flooded waters making all kinds of efforts to “help” the victims of the typhoon. One can be forgiven for saying she was trying to overshadow the first responders of the rescue operation. If she really cared, she would get out of the way and let the experts get on with their jobs with urgency. But she wouldn’t let an opportunity for an early campaign for the next election to slip by especially with the media following her every move.
Unfortunately, Robredo and her rabid supporters including her own daughters Tricia and Aika were trying their best to undermine the state’s rescue efforts by claiming the government abandoned the people who were in distress. That’s exceedingly unfair to the hard-working men and women of the government emergency response teams in the military, coast guard, and local governments who risked their lives to help those in need.
The Opposition made sure the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo “trended” again and again to make it look like Duterte was “missing in action” at the height of the recent typhoons. Robredo’s daughters Tricia and Aika were leading the pack of wolves attacking Duterte on social media. They were implying he was still sleeping while the country was getting battered by typhoon Ulysses. It’s worth noting that Robredo’s daughters are are not very smart. They don’t realise that because they are closely related to the Vice President, anything they say for or against Duterte has implications and reflects on the Office of the Vice President. It came as no surprise when Duterte finally responded to them.
Duterte called out Robredo for her opportunistic moves and swore to expose her as a liar for “pretending to make calls” and giving the impression she was coordinating rescue efforts. The President had to remind her that coordination with the different government agencies was done prior to the typhoon arriving and what she was doing was merely reacting to the situation. Of course Robredo wouldn’t have a clue about the government’s efforts because she is not in the loop. She’s not included in the meetings.
It was only right for Duterte to do that. Robredo never bothered to correct her rabid supporters including her own daughters who were asking where the President was during the typhoon when their mother knew where Duterte was – at an ASEAN summit. Robredo just allowed the hashtag to go on. She was probably so flattered by their praises to realise she was coming across as a narcissist blaming the President for the disaster and she taking all the credit for the government agencies’ rescue efforts.
In her defense, Robredo claimed she didn’t ask where the President was during the typhoon. But her statements to the media imply that there was absence of leadership during a crisis. She called Duterte “pikon” and said she stepped in because the government didn’t seem to be answering flood victims’ tweets. That wasn’t a very smart thing to say. If there is a national emergency, one shouldn’t rely on social media for answers. As the country’s Vice President, she should know what hotline to use for emergencies.
Robredo’s main problem is her vanity. She loves the media attention. The media is causing her downfall though. They are feeding her narcissism.  Some members of mainstream media are propping up Robredo and fashioning her into some sort of Florence Nightingale figure.  Her every move is documented as if what she’s doing is so different from what a lot of Vice Presidents did in the past. Previous VP’s like Jejomar Binay were even criticised for being trapo (traditional politician) for doing the same thing she’s doing now.
The media keeps praising Robredo as if she’s the only government official working. But she’s not the one doing the dirty work and actually rescuing people. What she’s doing is already being done by the local government and members of the military and Coast Guard. Yes, more help is needed but they are making her into a saint as a matter of misplaced priority.
All this is in preparation of the next Presidential election in 2022. This early, Robredo is already campaigning because her supporters are pushing her. It’s sometimes baffling why out of all Liberal Party members they only have Leni as the top bet for the 2022 Presidential Election. It’s likely because, one, no one else wants to put their hand up because it is a fact it is a losing party and, two, Leni is the only one dumb enough not to realise that.
If Robredo were honest with herself, she would say “I’m sorry but I cannot handle the job of the Presidency”. The problem is she is not honest with herself and her supporters. She thinks being President is all about giving dole outs to the public and making Filipinos look like sad charity cases while she plays Santa Claus. If she continues to undermine the efforts of government agencies including the military, she will fall out of their favour and lose respect. Some military men have already expressed their disdain for her.
No wonder a lot of people call Robredo the President of Twitter. Her followers and supporters are good at making hashtags “trend” on social media but fail miserably in getting the voters’ support during elections where it really counts. It’s obviously because hashtags can trend using fewer people while winning an election needs real people. They don’t even have originality. The hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo was first used on Noynoy when instead of attending the wake of the slain SAF, he went to an inauguration at a Japanese factory. The context was different then. Now they are using it to demand Duterte go out during a strong typhoon.
These people are never going to win an election because the public can see through their lies and negative propaganda. Honestly, they are simply not going to win with Robredo as their leader.",Others
Reliable COVID-19 Rapid Testing Kits Needed For Philippine Economic Recovery,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/reliable-covid-19-rapid-testing-kits-needed-for-philippine-economic-recovery/,"The Philippine response to the COVID-19 pandemic has already been described as one of the slowest, longest, and least effective in the world by public health experts who based their observations on corrected COVID-19 data.
Yesterday, we hit a new all time single day high of 1,150 confirmed COVID 19 cases. That’s 789 fresh cases with 361 late cases, surpassing the single day high of 1,000 cases on May 29, 2020.
So far, it looks like COVID-19 charts tracking confirmed cases show a trend of infections rocketing skyward rather than going down or even flattening.
If the Duterte Administration doesn’t make major crucial changes in how the country’s COVID-19 response is being managed, UP Professor Guido David’s prediction of 40,000 cases by the end of June coming to pass. (Source: https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1289772/covid-19-cases-in-ph-could-reach-40000-by-june-30-up-research-team#ixzz6QFRlM387 )
What could spell the difference in managing the country’s COVID-19 response would be to detect positive cases faster and more accurately.
That should mean finding out if an individual is infected or had been infected with COVID-19 in a matter of hours instead of weeks on a scale large enough that could out pace and prevent the further spread of the disease.
This is where the use of COVID-19 Rapid Testing Kits should be crucially effective.
However, based on the recent statement of the Lower House Health Committee Vice Chair Congressman Michael T. Defensor, it seems the FDA is making a mess of approving COVID-19 Rapid Testing Kits.
“Dapat hindi labo-labo, and hindi dapat kung ano anong brand na lang ang pinayagan ng FDA. Dapat ipaliwanag ng FDA ang batayan ng approval nila,” said Defensor.
Defensor suggested that since it lacks the capacity to test RTK brands, it would be practical to approve the brands endorsed by its counterpart in China, the National Medial Products Administration.
The following RTK brands that passed NMPA’s scrutiny are:
However, even then, a source who further scrutinized the NMPA approved RTKs revealed the following:
Guangzhou Wondfo is identified with Senator Manny Pacquiao and Jack Ma is said to be extremely unreliable and of very low quality. It is banned in the US.
Innovita is made by US company but is banned in the US and is being sold to Third World Countries. According to the source, doctors have switched to other brands after trying it. Its sale, at least in the Philippines, is said to be Spearheaded by Joey Concepcion who also happens to be the Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship.
The source also named other brands and gave opinions of these brands:
Roche is said to be consistent but needs a lab here in the Philippines. It cannot detect IgM or infection at the time of testing.
Healgen, formerly known as Orient Gene, a Chinese brand that was banned in its own country because of its low IgM sensitivity.
Chembio was pulled from US FDA EUA.
CTK is not approved by the US FDA and has been banned in the US.
The source says that among the brands of Covid-19 Rapid Testing Kits, Cellex has been recognized as one of the best.
Dr. KC Halili of LabX which oversees the Philippine sales of Cellex, noted that their brand has “an accuracy of 93.8 percent and a sensitivity of 96 percent.”
They claim it qualifies it as the most excellent 15-minute test in the Philippines along with the distinction of being the first rapid test in the world to get authorization from both the US FDA and Philippine FDA.
However, despite Cellex’s gleaming reputation, it has so far shown up with a stronger communications game and looks like a giraffe lost in a forest of Chinese brands.
Even worse, it seemed to have been pitted against instead of being a complement to the gold standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test.",Others
Twitter is now officially more powerful than the US Government,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/twitter-is-now-officially-more-powerful-than-the-us-government/,"Hats off to Big Corporate Social Media. They first started out as little websites where people could “share” stuff and engage in “social networking”. Then they started to call themselves “platforms” and rightly so as such was to become their reach, ubiquity, and deep embedding into the fabric of society that people could be forgiven for thinking that they actually were the Internet itself.
As they continued in their unprecedented growth into the virtual sovereign digital states that they are today, Big Corporate Social Media’s services had become just as essential to life as the public services that conventional governments guarantee their respective citizens. As such, they gained the same power over millions of people’s lives and wellbeing once associated only with national governments.
Today, Twitter “permanently suspended” the account of no less than the President of the United States. That officially makes Twitter more powerful than the US Government itself — and, disturbingly, more powerful than America’s enemies.
The irony here is in how it succeeded in doing what US President Donald Trump’s enemies can only pay lip service to doing for now — impeach and silence the President within its private sovereign realm. It did so in less than one tenth of the time it would likely have taken the whole US democratic apparatus to deliver the same result. And it did so with none of the transparency America’s democratic apparatus owes its participants.
Twitter is, of course, a private enterprise and its network and infrastructure private property. Thus its powers-that-be can allow — or disallow — anyone access to its platform. But, see, that is why it is more powerful than the US government. Twitter’s Netizens have no alternative place to go. Twitter enjoys the scale and the benefit of massive network ubiquity to render most alternatives effectively inconsequential. In a different context, that fact alone has for some time been the basis for antitrust rumblings in various quarters. In the context of Trump’s ouster from the platform, Twitter’s monopoly for now is regarded as a positive thing — selective tolerance of monopoly, right? And even if an alternative platform enterprise did emerge that could refuse to conform to today’s Facebook-Apple-Google-Twitter Axis, go its own, and succeed as a realistic alternative, who’s to say that this alternative would not one day behave the way Twitter does today?
For that matter, what if new social media networks hosted in other countries — notably “non-democratic” ones — emerge and host chatter deemed unacceptable to the “civil societies” of the West? Will Western countries start to put up their own versions of China’s Great Firewall to keep all that out?
The key thing to consider here is that Trump has an audience. In today’s hyper-networked world, voices find their audiences eventually. History is a trove of walls that had been put up by one empire or another but, in the end, the more competitive force won and the walls left standing that had become today’s quaint tourist destinations are testament to the futile hubris of wall-building.
The short of it is that the fact that Twitter had to resort to banishing US President Donald Trump highlights a long-unfolding failure of America’s coastal elite to win over his constituents competitively despite enjoying the backing of Big Corporate Mainstream Media and, of course, Big Corporate Social Media.",Others
Duque Should Ban Two Korean Covid-19 Rapid Testing Kits Before Soul Searching,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/duque-should-ban-two-korean-covid-19-rapid-testing-kits-before-soul-searching/,"What Health Secretary Francisco Duque III should be doing is to double down on putting his nose to the grindstone and shun the cringe-inducing dramatics of being under-appreciated as well as needing to do some soul searching.
Ditto for Covid-19 Testing “Czar” Secretary Vince Dizon.
Perhaps, if they did, they could have prevented the country from being flooded by substandard Korean Covid-19 rapid testing kits made by SD Biosensor and RapiGen Inc.
Most likely, the Covid-19 testing kits made by these two companies were used in hundreds of hospitals and clinics. False-negative readings could have contributed to increased disease transmissions and false-positives could have caused unnecessary emotional as well as financial trauma.
The US FDA banned SD Biosensor’s Standard Q Covid-19 IgM/IgG Duo in June — NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO.
India pulled SD Biosensor’s Standard Q Covid-19 IgM/IgG Duo in July and suspended the company’s distribution license.
The other substandard Korean testing kit, Rapigen’s Biocredit Covid-19, failed the standards set by the Malaysian Ministry of Health’s Institute for Medical Research.
Biocredit Covid-19 was found to have a low sensitivity rate of 43.3 percent which makes it very likely to produce false positives.
Dizon and Duque should ban these two Korean Covid-19 testing kits IMMEDIATELY.
If my lawyer/columnist friends probably read about this latest slip up before putting out their opinion pieces this week, it probably would have added to their already lengthy lament over the horrible performance of the government’s Covid-19 response.
One of them, Atty. Goy Larrazabal, already scored the IATF’s ineffective reversion to a stricter community quarantine.
He writes: “Did the government do a comprehensive Triple T approach, which is the TEST, TRACE and TREAT?  That’s a big no.  In fact, many were shocked when the Department of Health issued a Public Advisory informing the general public that Filipinos should beware of scams of people claiming to be contact tracers, because…. There are no contact tracing teams of the Department of Health.  That was mind-blowing considering the first official infection in the Philippines was way back in January, and we’re already August.  Saying that’s scandalous doesn’t even begin to convey how disturbing that news was.  I would not have believed it myself, except that it was an official announcement of the Department.  So, August, and still no national contact tracing teams.”
But if ever contact tracing teams did their job right, their effort would be rendered meaningless by inaccurate Covid-19 testing kits.
The way things are going, with government’s ineptitude and Covid-19 paranoia driving the economy to the ground, we’re really up doo-doo creek without a paddle.
If that’s the case, the President could do all of us a favor by serving us up his inimitable candor  and just tell us all during official business hours that… WE’RE DOOMED!

COVID-19 economic collapse is the crisis the Philippines had to have!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/covid-19-economic-collapse-is-the-crisis-the-philippines-had-to-have/,"Filipinos can no longer rely on their traditional gravy trains — OFWism, work outsourced from the First World, foreign investment, and foreign aid — to prop up their labour-added-value economy. Foreign workers are coming “home” by the droves, the First World is rapidly repatriating its offshore work, and governments all over the world are diverting state resources to their own citizens’ safety nets, thus reducing their foreign aid budgets. This leaves the Philippine economy with just its domestic market and capital base to chug along with.
Even the most conservative estimates put the portion of the economy accounted for by the economic activity generated by these non-sustainable sectors at nothing less than 25 percent of national “output”. When one factors in other industries severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic — travel, tourism, and entertainment — that percentage may go up. The collapse of these employment-generating activities then impacts consumption and, with this decline, goes the revenues of retail, leisure, and other non-essentials. The last economic holdout will be capital-intensive industries like manufacturing, infrastructure, and technology industries which happen to be areas the Philippines is thin on.
In short, the Philippines sports the sort of economy — one propped up by consumption and labour-intensive industries — that is just one crisis away from catastrophic collapse. That time has come.
It is easy to build an entire Opposition “platform” on the notion that the government — that of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, in this case — is to blame for any sort of economic crisis. To be fair, the Duterte government had been remiss on a lot of measures that could have been put in place early to reduce the impact of the pandemic not to mention competently managing and leading through the crisis as it ripped through the country. There is room to argue that good crisis management could have mitigated a portion the economic pain being felt by Filipinos today. However, a truly honest assessment of the economic fallout requires a complete stock take of what contributes to the economic impact in terms of both (1) the effect of the quality of the Philippine Government response and (2) the effect of factors outside of the control of the Philippine Government.
Let’s explore then the ideal scenario, one where the Philippine Government had managed to ban all travel before carriers of the COVID-19 virus infected anyone within the islands. In such a scenario, the Philippines would have been completely sealed (and quarantine rules strictly followed for returning Filipino nationals) and physically isolated from the rest of the world. The best responses still involved some degree of curtailment of freedoms and economic activity and, of course, OFWs would still be losing their jobs and work offshored from the First World returning back onshore. The travel and transport industry would still collapse and a global economic downturn would still have an effect on the Philippines’ foreign trade.
Taking all of that into account, and the structural weakness of the Philippine economy which, as I described in a 2014 article, is characterised by a stunted capital base and depends on labour-added-value for most of its output, it is likely that the Philippines would still suffer a significant economic collapse even under the best circumstances. I wrote back then…
In good times, the economic value sustained by commercial activity in most economies keeps peoples’ quality of life safely above the absolute poverty line. The inherent risk that is always present in labour-intensive economies becomes apparent in bad times.
Whereas a robust equity base in a well-capitalised economy helps keep its peoples’ heads above water in a depression, there is no such rock bottom in a labour-intensive economy. Like a super-massive star destined to collapse into a dimensionless black hole, economic collapse in a labour-intensive economy can plunge the majority of its population below absolute poverty into wretched levels of existence.
So then coming back to the matter of the dishonest assertion of the Philippine Opposition, we might ask in this regard:
Is Duterte to blame for the economic collapse?
A truly competent economist would approach that question armed with the right perspective — that there is a part of this economic collapse attributable to external forces outside of the control of the Duterte administration, and there is a part of it that will have been mitigated had the government done things a certain way (the “right” ways being, for that matter, being hopelessly debatable too).
One can consider anything short of such an approach to analysing the situation to be an incompetent effort. To go so far as to backward-engineer an “analysis” from a preconception (or agenda) that seeks to pin all blame for an economic collapse on one person or even one government is an absolute dishonest and malicious effort.
The venerable band Joy Division had this to say in its 1980 song “Passover”…
This is a crisis I knew had to come
Destroying the balance I’d kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around
Wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live?
I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy’s guard
It all falls apart at first touch",Others
The Philippine Opposition need to find a SMARTER way of using COVID-19 as an election-winning “issue”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/the-philippine-opposition-need-to-find-a-smarter-way-of-using-covid-19-as-an-election-winning-issue/,"Following the colossal collapse of their first opening campaign salvo, the ill-fated “1Sambayan” initiative, Filipinos are still holding their breath waiting for the Philippine Opposition’s next major brainwave. So far all we get is the usual noise — the same shrill whining over how the Philippines is coping with the 12-month-old COVID-19 pandemic. That “crisis” is now last year’s news. It’s become baked into the big cake that is most ordinary Filipinos’ wretched daily lives.
Indeed, in case the Opposition’s foremost “thought leaders” haven’t noticed yet, the COVID-19 pandemic has long been banalised. It takes its place amongst all the other historically-unsolved big problems that aren’t as newsworthy or as potent fodders for political grandstanding and mudslinging. It is on its way to becoming just another one of the poor’s problems that rich people can desensitise themselves to — just another “issue” they can externalise as they remain hunkered down in their chi chi fortified communities and enclaves.
13,000 COVID deaths you say? To put that in perspective, more than 10,000 died over just a week or two of Typhoon Haiyan’s visit in 2013 alone. None of the risks that expose possibly hundreds of thousands of Filipinos to death by typhoons and other natural calamities have been mitigated since then. This is not to mention the bigger number of Filipinos who succumb to preventable deaths — health issues and injuries that could be otherwise resolved by fast and competent emergency response times and adequate medical and health care infrastructure. There’s also all those accidents waiting to happen thanks to Philippine society’s renowned lack of regard for safety and preventive maintenance. Taken together across land, sea, and air transport and infrastructure, these will likely account for another ten thousand-odd lives at risk of preventable death.
The country’s health and emergency services, its maturity as far as safety awareness, the quality of its systems and engineering, and the state of military preparedness are not up to scratch and those things have never been cornerstones of any election campaign platform. In short they’ve long been problems stretching back in history through multiple Philippine governments. What then makes this incompetent response to COVID-19 any different from all the other astounding displays of incompetence when faced with emergencies and adversities exhibited by the Philippines’ state services and collective community responses over much of its history since being granted independence by the United States in 1946?
The short of it is that taken in the context of the full landscape of preventable deaths that Filipinos are exposed to because of traditions of incompetence that go back decades, the COVID-19 crisis contributes a mere rounding-off error.
Given all of the above realities, here is the important question: Is the Opposition’s monomanic focus on COVID-19 as the lynchpin for their campaign against the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte — and a cornerstone of their campaign for 2022 — good political strategy? Put it another way, do Filipinos really care about the way the Opposition presume to whine about all this on their behalf? If not, then the Opposition are well advised to come up with something better than COVID-19 Crybabyism to use as fodder for their political campaigns. See, the investment of time, energy, and capital the Opposition plow into making COVID-19 an election “issue” will likely not yield the only really important returns here — converted voters.
On the other hand, if Filipinos do care about the COVID-19 government response and see it as a key factor in who and what they decide to vote for in 2022, are the Opposition playing the COVID-19 Card right? Is whining (in the shrill manner we see today) about how Duterte handled the crisis enough to convert voters? Or is there a smarter way for the Opposition to make COVID-19 an election issue that works in their favour? The Opposition need to put pen to paper and fire up their fancy spreadsheets to really analyse the numbers. Suffice to say, popularity surveys conducted by reputable polling firms over the last 12 months already show that COVID-19 has not put a dent on the formidable political capital the Duterte camp enjoys to this day. The message should have been clear to the Opposition even as far back as mid-2020 and, still, they seem to have not learned anything.
Look at it from the ordinary Filipino’s point of view and ask, for example, whether the risk of death of not wearing a mask or face shield is as big as eating pagpag (food made from ingredients collected from garbage bins). Or if raising kids to live and beg at street corners everyday and breath Manila’s corrosive air is any worse than not keeping one’s distance from another while riding a jeepney. Or if that mound of rubbish in front of one’s doorstep that hasn’t been collected for days exudes pathogens that aren’t as deadly as any you’d be exposed to under this COVID-19 “crisis”.
Ordinary Filipinos make those little life-and-death decisions everyday. To face COVID-19 is just another one of those little life choices they face with stoic faces while the chi chi “thought leaders” of the Opposition tapping away on their iPads while they sip their lattes at the local Starbucks incite outrage fads on social media and mount shrill “activist” campaigns over. What Filipinos need are ways forward and pathways around these problems. Is the Opposition up to the challenge of getting their rhetoric up to that intellectual level? That remains to be seen — that is, if they can get over their traditional ways of using the old empty “pro-democracy”, “pro-people”, and “unity” as collateral for their dishonest platforms and do their part in contributing real substance to Philippine democracy.",Others
"DOH Issues Advisory Against TruLaboratories Corporation, Warns Other Companies",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/doh-issues-advisory-against-trulaboratories-corporation-warns-other-companies/,"It appears that companies have jumped the gun on the still to be approved Omnibus Guidelines on COVID-19 Testing and have begun marketing their testing kits through social media.
This has prompted the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) to issue an advisory calling out TruLaboratories Corporation for publishing a social media post which it says their brand has been finally approved and is included in the Omnibus Guidelines on COVID-19 Testing.
The advisory, which is hardly a slap on the wrist, says:
The Department Health (DOH) is issuing this statement to correct the social media post of TruLaboratories Corporation claiming that “DOH has finally approved the use of Antigen Test Kits and is now included in the Omnibus Guidelines on COVID 19 Testing”.
DOH clarifies that The Omnibus Guidelines on COVID 19 Testing HAS NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED OR APPROVED, nor has it been signed and issued for implementation.
Moreover, while there are antigen kits approved for commercial use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DOH DOES NOT ENDORSE specific brands or distributors.
DOH calls on the public to be vigilant when it comes to information, and verify everything through the DOH’s official website and social media pages. Lastly, DOH calls on everyone to BIDA Solusyon sa COVID-19.
A cursory inspection of TruLaboratories Corporation Facebook Page which bears images of its brand of COVID-19 testing kits reveals why DOH might be having a problem with the company.
The packaging of the company’s COVID-19 testing kits appears to be taking advantage of the confusion it would create in the market, appearing to be branded as COVID-19 ANTIGEN instead of STANDARD Q COVID 19 Antigen Test — a product already banned by the US FDA and pulled from shelves in India. (More information here: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kit-import-licence-of-3-firms-cancelled-15-suspended-order-based-on-ban-by-usfda-6523542/)
Although why the DOH chose to merely issue an advisory against TruLaboratories and has not called on the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate as well as possibly sanction the company for an easily misleading label is unclear.
It is clear, however, that the paranoia created by fearmongers over COVID-19 has made the general public susceptible to unscrupulous marketing practices by shady entities masquerading as legitimate manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies as well as equipment.
On the other hand, word from the grapevine says that LabX’s Sofia2 COVID-19 testing kit passed the standards set by the yet to be approved under the DOH Omnibus Guidelines on COVID-19 Testing.
The company is said to be waiting for the final approval of the DOH Omnibus Guidelines before making an official announcement.",Others
Duterte is right. The Philippine arbitral “win” versus China not worth the paper it is printed on.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/duterte-is-right-the-philippine-arbitral-win-versus-china-not-worth-the-paper-it-is-printed-on/,"Thing with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is that he calls important stuff for what they are. In the case of the Philippines’ claim to vast territories in the South China Sea, Duterte points out that waving a piece of paper at a global power quietly building structures on territory other powers say you have a rightful claim to translates to jack squat in global politics. Filipinos, in fact, should know better. Right in their own backyard is a clear case study of how documents don’t amount to much when dealing with trespassers. It’s called The Squatter Issue. Filipinos can only watch helplessly as their own domestic squatter infestation delivers nothing but grief to land owners, unnecessarily drains public coffers to evict their perpetrators, slows infrastructure development to a crawl, and provides fodder for dishonest communist “activism”.
Wave a title deed or court order to the face of a resident of any one of the Philippines’ vast squatter colonies and you’ll likely get an ice pick through your liver in return. For that matter, try telling off even a chi chi tita who cuts in front of you in a queue for a latte at the local Starbucks and you’re up for a smack across the face with her fake Gucci handbag. Quite ironic that a key bloc within the Opposition — the communists — are big fans of such behaviour. That’s the same sort of reality Duterte describes in the context of the Philippines’ face off with China. “Nag-file sila ng kaso nanalo tayo. Sa totoong buhay, between nation, iyang papel wala iyan… actually… bigay mo sakin iyan sabihin ko ‘P***ng-ina papel lang iyan.’ Itatapon ko iyan sa waste basket,” Duterte said of the ruling. (Translated: “We won in the case filed. In real life, pieces of paper like that don’t matter between nations. Give that piece of paper to me and I’ll say [expletive] that’s just a piece of paper. I’d throw that into the waste basket”)
We pretend that the world has evolved a lot since World War II. The fact is, might continues to determine what is right. The fact that nations that truly matter invest enormous chunks of their budget on their militaries proves this. Does the Philippines matter in that scheme of things? The truth is quite simple. The only reason China is not moving faster and more menacingly than it already is in the South China Sea is because it is wisely considering the possibility of military action by countries like the United States, Japan, and Australia that pose real threats to its goals. The Philippines’ efforts at “diplomacy” are really no more than a quaint side show.
Weak countries like the Philippines continue to exist only because powerful countries allow them to. A world order supposedly ruled by “international law” is no more than a glossy pretense. No less than the United States itself has, time and again, demonstrated that its own national interests trump United Nations “resolutions” any day. Military might is the only real currency in international “relations”. Filipinos continue to bank on their “friendship” with the United States to back their huffing and puffing over China’s “illegal” incursions but think for a moment if such a “friendship” is really the two-way street Filipinos imagine it to be. Senior Cato Institute fellow Doug Bandow offers some clues on what the Philippines’ “friend” might actually think of its old chum(p) in the Far East…
Indeed, some things never change. One is the limited value of the Philippines as an ally. Its people are friendly and welcoming — and quite pro‐​American. But it is a semi‐​failed state with a military to match. Manila is a sad example of how the US has picked up the old German habit of allying with the least stable nations possessing the weakest militaries — as Berlin did with Austro‐​Hungary in World War I and Italy in World War II.
In the case of Washington the primes useless partner is the Philippines. The relationship wouldn’t matter so much if Manila didn’t expect America to protect not only its home islands, but also every useless piece of rock claimed by the Philippines against China, such as Scarborough Shoal. If Beijing and Washington end up at war — a horrific possibility — the cause should be more serious than the Philippines.
Recall that when the Philippines “won” a “favourable ruling” from the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague on the matter of the disputed territories of the South China Sea, there already had been little indication that China would be in any mood to respect the PCA decision. China had remained consistent with that position ever since. In fact, China has, from the very start, asserted that it does not and will not recognise jurisdiction of the The Hague over this matter. Second, it had exhibited a wherewithal to invest heavily in the development of infrastructure and the colonisation of various islands in the disputed territory. And last and most important of all, a wealth of precedents had long been set by other world powers ignoring any rulings by international bodies that are not in their favour.
For that matter, China’s behaviour does not really differ much from world powers that pretend to play ball when it comes to “international law”. Consider the behaviour of other countries that had found themselves in similar circumstances. Graham Allison writing for The Diplomat details the sorry record of the world’s mightiest nations when faced with rulings that their governments perceive to be not aligned with their nation’s sovereign interests.  Allison cites how “none of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council have ever accepted any international court’s ruling when (in their view) it infringed their sovereignty or national security interests.”
One of the examples he cites is quite confronting…
Anticipating the Court’s ruling in the case brought by the Philippines, UK Prime Minister David Cameron proclaimed: “We want to encourage China to be part of that rules-based world. We want to encourage everyone to abide by these adjudications.” Perhaps he had forgotten that just last year the PCA ruled that the UK had violated the Law of the Sea by unilaterally establishing a Marine Protected Area in the Chagos Islands. The British government disregarded the ruling, and the Marine Protected Area remains in place today.
As for the United States, the “ally” the Philippines is counting on to back any next steps it might take following the PCA ruling, our pal lacks any ascendancy to take China to task on the applicable laws in this instance. The PCA in its final decision ruled that the actions of China in the disputed territories of the South China Sea and its so-called “nine-dash line” are “contrary to the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 10 December 1982] and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China’s maritime entitlements under the Convention”. Unfortunately, the US has, itself, declined to ratify the UNCLOS and, as such, is not bound by it. On that note, Allison writes, “If China followed that precedent, it could withdraw from the Law of the Sea Treaty altogether – joining the United States as one of the world’s only nations not party to the agreement.”
The truth is quite stark. No great world power has ever become great nor powerful by bowing down to any other power or acceding to any agreement unfavourable to its long-term interests. As such, China’s stance is consistent with historical precedent overall. The Philippines, for its part, would not have found itself in this position had its past governments exercised more foresight surrounding national defense. Instead, successive governments had allowed the Philippines’ once-respectable military capability to degenerate to what is now less than a pale shadow of its former self.
Since the PCA issued its “favourbale” ruling, the Philippines did not squarely face the potentially embarrassing prospect of having to answer the question: What’s Next? This is, perhaps, where the Duterte administration comes from today. Unless Filipinos can answer that question with a firm slam-dunk, any notion of a “win” here can only be token at best. Considering that the Philippines lacks any capability to enforce the PCA ruling, coming up with a response that saves face remains a formidable challenge. If the Opposition think Duterte is not up to the job of coming with such a response, their “thought leaders” should, at the very least, propose one instead of spending their days whining about what is not being done.",Others
Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte and The Rise to National Prominence of Local Government Executives,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/davao-city-mayor-inday-sara-duterte-and-the-rise-to-national-prominence-of-local-government-executives/,"To be sure, former Davao City Mayor and now President Rodrigo Roa Duterte wasn’t the first local government executive to have risen to national prominence through a presidential bid.
But I guess his win in 2016 may be written down by some as a turning point in our history of elections when people began looking at local executives (governors and mayors) as serious contenders for the country’s presidency.
He broke the mold of previous winning presidential candidates who usually had national prominence first before seeking the Presidency in the Post EDSA 86 era.
Now, with the incipient candidacy of his daughter Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte, we may yet see another historic and game changing presidential election win in 2022.
Not only will this be the first time that another local government executive will start a succession of local government executives elected as president, it might also be the first time that the daughter of a sitting president will take over the reins of power.
Even better, we may even see Duterte the daughter rise as President with her father as Vice President.
Unprecedented, indeed!
Some may describe this as a consolidation of a national political dynasty and say that such dynasties are a bad thing.
But I would point out that the country’s largest and longest running enterprises in business as well as in politics happen to be run mostly by dynasties.
Dynasties, as Senator Richard Gordon once told me personally, are not a bad thing per se.
He said that there are dynasties that advance the society that engenders them  and are considered good in many respects; these ones continue for as long as they can. Then, there are also bad dynasties which commit acts that lead to the disintegration of society, its very foundations, and these ones are eventually destroyed.
Moreover, I guess it is time to admit that political dynasties are actually the norm in Philippine politics. Just Google: “Philippine political families” and you will see that there is practically no area in the country not held by one or another political dynasty. These dynasties appear either as a succession of the same last names in the same positions or the same last names in different positions within the same time period and locality.
It’s really a no brainer as to why no anti-dynasty bill will ever pass into law.
Thing is, if political dynasties come to being and continue to exist, there ought to be other reasons for it to happen other than just the flippant condemnation that Filipinos are just corrupt or backward.
I’ve heard it said that if the Singsons or Marcoses were completely taken out of power, our Ilokos provinces would be put in disarray and its people locked in violent political feuds for domination. Moreover, the Ilokos region continues to post healthy economic growth and is the 8th largest contributor to the country’s GDP as of 2018.
Political dynasties, it would seem, stabilize the country’s politics and economy better than the fleshless creatures which we call principles and laws.
Perhaps these term limits as well as the notion of banning political dynasties were artificially and irrationally conceived as a palliative reaction to the twenty year Marcos rule that preceded it.
Instead of working with and enhancing the beneficial aspects of our cultural norms for political succession and expansion, an automatic limit was imposed on all without regard for whether the incumbent political leader and his clan could continue to deliver good governance; or if there were aspirants whose capabilities equal or even surpass that of the incumbent.
Instead of freeing the people to decide on the length of a leader’s reign, it locked us up in perpetual  cycles of very costly electoral contests.
Given the fact that we have a large number of families doing round robins in elective positions or occupying the whole roster of elective positions at the same time and given that this appears to be the norm of current political practices, it behooves our legislators to remove the backward looking constitutional provision on automatic term limits as well as the ban on political dynasties.
Perhaps, in its place, legislature can devise a performance based system for determining whether a political leader should continue or be booted out.
On the political front closer to my home, Quezon City’s political elite is in a struggle to determine whether to continue the reign of the Belmonte coalition or break it up in favor of a new political coalition.
My acquaintances, who are somewhat involved in Quezon City politics, have an impression that Mayor Joy Belmonte’s hold on power may be weak and her performance sorely lacking.
This is quite contrary to a recent independent survey conducted by RP-Mission and Development Foundation Inc. (RPMD) which says that QC Mayor Joy is the top performing local chief executive in the National Capital Region (NCR), The survey results were based on face-to-face interviews with 3,500 respondents, who were asked to rate their respective mayors regarding their overall job performance for 2020.
Take the survey for what you will, but there are names that keep cropping up as challengers to current QC Mayor.
These are:
Anakalusugan Party-list Representative Michael “Mike” Tan Defensor. He was my former big boss when he was the HUDCC Chairman and was largely credited for clearing informal settlers from the PNR embankments. After his stint as former President Gloria Arroyo’s number 1 guy and DENR Secretary, he ran for Quezon City Mayor in 2010 and ended up topping the other also-rans with 130,000 votes against Herbert Bautista who garnered over 500,000 votes.
For some time, he stepped away from politics and focused on steering one or several mining firms. Then after his hiatus from politics and government, he ran as the second nominee of Anakalusugan party-list in 2019 and when the party-list won a seat, he emerged as its representative.
Mike has somewhat of a colorful political career with a couple of misadventures that I will tell you about in a future post.
Quezon City Councilor Winston “Winnie” Castelo. He is possibly the best known Quezon City councilor with a career spanning 26 years.
He was QC Councilor from 1995–2004 and then again from 2019 to this present day.
I assume he took a break from 2004 to 2009 before running and winning as Congressman 2nd District of Quezon City in 2010. He made consecutive runs for the same position and held it up to 2019. Thereafter, running for QC Councilor and winning.
He doesn’t have a Wikipedia entry that summarizes his rather lengthy career and accomplishments, but he does have a building with his name on it that serves as a landmark in his district. From various accounts, Winnie is big on giving away ayuda long before the COVID19 pandemic hit us and is well loved by the people in his district.
The Castelos are one of the families that dominate Quezon City politics.
His wife, Precious Hipolito-Castelo is the current Congresswoman of Quezon City’s 2nd district and was 2nd District councilor from 2010–2019.
His sister, Nanette Castelo-Daza, was congresswoman of Quezon City’s 4th district from 2001 to 2010. His niece, Jessica Castelo-Daza, was 4th district councilor from 2010 to 2016. Other relatives occupying legislative positions in the city are Karl Edgar Castelo in the 5th district (a position he has occupied since 2013) and Bobby Castelo in the 6th district (a position he has been in since 2013).
Former congressman Bingbong Crisologo. Of the would-be contenders for Quezon City Mayor, perhaps Bingbong is the only one whose family isn’t so deeply rooted  the city’s history or dominates the landscape.  The only other Crisologos holding an elective position is his son Onyx, who was elected congressman of the 1st District — a position that Bingbong formerly held until his run for QC Mayor in 2019 which he lost by a hundred thousand votes.
When I was in my early teens in the early 1980s, I used to see Bingbong a lot in the Galas area. I didn’t know him as a politician but as a leader of a Catholic movement geared towards catechism for the youth.
His religiosity is one of the things he is best known for after being pardoned by former President Ferdinand Marcos for arson which he committed in 1970 in Ilocos Sur.
The other crime appended to his name is malversation thru falsification of public documents for anomalous pork barrel projects in 2009. He was indicted by the Ombudsman but dismisses the charge as being politically motivated.
Senator Tito Sotto. His son Gian is currently Vice Mayor of Quezon City and if Senator Sotto does run for Mayor, would he run with his son?
Perhaps it would be a catchy a headline as the father-daughter teaming of Inday Sarah Duterte for President and outgoing president Duterte as Vice President.
To the national team up of Duterte-Duterte, maybe we will see Quezon City coming up with a Sotto-Sotto.
But, anyway, Sotto’s political roots are deep and the landscape his last name occupies is quite broad.
Sotto’s paternal grandfather and namesake was former senator Vicente Sotto (1877–1950). Vicente’s brother, Filemon (1872–1966) also served as a senator and was one of those who drafted the 1935 Constitution.
He was vice mayor of Quezon City from 1988 to 1992. Then served two terms as senator from 1992 to 2004. After a brief absence from politics, he won as senator again in 2010 and ran for re-election in 2016.
Apart from Senator Tito and Vice Mayor Gian, the other Sottos in public office are:
`Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto, Lala Sotto who has been serving as councilor of the 6th District of Quezon City since 2013 and Wahoo Sotto who has been serving as councilor of the 2nd district of Parañaque City also since 2013.
To be fair to these gentlemen, I haven’t come across any news of them saying that they were even considering a run for the Quezon City Mayoralty. The only way to know for sure is if they file their certificate of candidacy for QC Mayor in October.
But, supposing they are running against Mayor Joy’s possible re-election bid, so everything is still up in the air.",Others
The LIAR Justice Carpio should accept President Duterte’s challenge to a debate,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/the-liar-justice-carpio-should-accept-president-dutertes-challenge-to-a-debate/,"Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio leads the only group — 1Sambayan — that aspires to cobble together a broad Opposition coalition to go up against the camp of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the coming 2022 elections. It therefore makes sense that Carpio, at the very least, dignify the President’s challenge to a debate with a response. At best, Carpio should accept it. He is, after all, a leader (perhaps by default, for now) of a major Opposition bloc that has explicitly expressed its intention to face off with a formidable incumbent.
According to the above-cited Inquirer report, Duterte “has been insisting that Carpio and then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario were involved in the decision to withdraw Navy ships from the West Philippine Sea. He said he would resign if anyone could prove that he was lying about this.” Carpio and his camp are also up against the likes of Manila Times columnist and former ambassador Bobi Tiglao who, for months, has been calling out Carpio and, at the time, Foreign Affairs secretary Albert del Rosario for seriously misleading Filipinos into thinking they had won a ruling that favoured their claim over China’s on certain South China Sea territories.
In his September 2019 piece “Arbitral ruling a colossal deception: It damaged our national interests”, Tiglao points out that that Del Rosario, in citing “Chinese government vessels’ attempts in May 2013 to block Philippine vessels from providing supplies to our 12-man marine detachment in Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal living in the BRP Sierra Madre wreck” as part of their argument, inadvertently attracted a “devastating” ruling that framed their case as one hinged on a “military situation” and therefore outside of the jurisdiction of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Tiglao writes…
The implication of this ruling is devastating to us. It means that any Chinese (or Vietnamese) attempt to use some kind of force — such as a blockade of, say, our Pag-asa Island to starve our contingent there — falls outside the jurisdiction of Unclos. Can we ask the US to intervene? Well, Aquino and del Rosario did during the Scarborough stand-off in 2012: then-President Obama outrightly refused to even have US ships escort our fisheries bureau’s vessel and our fishermen’s boats into the shoal.
With the the nature of most pathways forward interpreted as predominantly potential “military situations”, the idea that the Philippines can actually execute its perceived entitlements given its practically non-existent military capability is ludicrous at best. In his July 2016 Washington Post report “Why the South China Sea ruling matters”, Erik Voeten referencing research conducted by University of Maryland scholars Benjamin Appel, Sarah Croco and Paul Huth points out that there are “few, if any, examples of arbitral rulings in which great powers give in to smaller powers over sovereignty disputes.” Furthermore…
The Philippines’ clear bargaining position may help, but it could also hurt. If it holds on to the PCA ruling too stringently it may forgo opportunities for peaceful settlement. The ruling could also draw other countries into uncomfortable foreign policy choices between a desire to uphold international law and a desire to appease China.
In short, this paper-pushing adventurism mounted by minions of the administration of former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III all but pushed the Philippines into an even tighter space — one that only military might can get it out of. Clearly the Philippines has none such.
In his follow-up piece “Carpio persists in lying about arbitration ruling vs China” published in January 2020 Tiglao had already crafted the challenge to Carpio and his mob…
I challenge Carpio, academic Jay Batongbacal, the writers at that vainly named Albert del Rosario Institute for Strategic Studies that the former Yellow Foreign Affairs secretary has set up together with a US think-tank to fool the nation on our disputes with China, and those still cheering that huge blunder that was the arbitration suit against China, to rebut my arguments and data — for the sake of the nation. I hope Carpio can start this debate by responding directly to this column.
Carpio has seemingly not responded to Tiglao. Who is Tiglao after all, right? Just a journalist who asks all the hard questions that Carpio need not dignify with even just an acknowledgement. Today, however, we have no less than the President of the Philippines summoning him to respond. The words of Major Richard Winters portrayed in the TV series Band of Brothers come to mind; “salute the rank, not the man”. Carpio may not respect the man but he should, as an officer of the law, respect the office.",Others
Trump ouster highlights just how ARBITRARY the enormous power of Twitter is,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/trump-ouster-highlights-just-how-arbitrary-the-enormous-power-of-twitter-is/,"An unintended consequence of the “permanent suspension” of US President Donald Trump’s account on Twitter is how the awesome power of Big Corporate Social Media — that can so arbitrarily be wielded — has been laid bare for all to behold. It has now come to light that Twitter and the rest of the Silicon Valley Boy’s Club did something that could have been done earlier. But that’s just one way of looking at it. More disturbingly, it could do the same thing again and under circumstances that may not necessarily be for “the social good”.
For that matter, we must question who really is the final authority on what this “social good” is. In the context of a democracy, it depends, in principle, on what the majority says it is on account of how legislative bodies of democratically-elected representatives of “the people” are authorised to make those rules. And, indeed, they do via transparent processes that are subject to checks and balances known to the public. And then there is the way a private owner of space essential to a broad swathe (arguably the critical mass) of public discourse that has become essential to most people’s lives crafts and executes similar rules. Like Twitter. Or Facebook. Evelyn Douek writes in The Atlantic that she finds this disturbing.
This week a small handful of extremely powerful tech executives slowly tiptoed toward the edge, egging one another on, being pushed by commentators and employees, until they agreed to hold hands and jump. This was a display of awesome power, not an acknowledgment of culpability. These were more editorial and business decisions taken under fire than the neutral application of prior guidelines. A tiny group of people in Silicon Valley are defining modern discourse, ostensibly establishing a Twilight Zone where the rules are something between democratic governance and journalism, but they’re doing it on the fly in ways that suit them.
Writing for The New York Times, Michelle Goldberg calls this power scary.
Private companies have shown themselves able to act far more nimbly than our government, imposing consequences on a would-be tyrant who has until now enjoyed a corrosive degree of impunity. But in doing so, these companies have also shown a power that goes beyond that of many nation-states, one they apply capriciously and without democratic accountability. As The Verge noted, it’s hard to make sense of a system that leads to the trolly left-wing podcast “Red Scare” being suspended from Twitter, but not the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Indeed, Silicon Valley has, just in the last several days, shown that they are more powerful than the government of the planet’s mightiest nation. They had evidently sent chills up the spines of some European leaders.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the decision of Twitter to ban the US President as “problematic” and France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire asserts that “Digital regulation should not be done by the digital oligarchy itself. […] Regulation of the digital arena is a matter for the sovereign people, governments and the judiciary.”
It seems that the spectacle of Silicon Valley’s titans colluding to exclude US President Donald Trump from the netisphere has raised many questions — and eyebrows. The speed with which they and their woke cheerleaders elevated themselves to “heroes” could be matched by the speed with which more sober observers could throw a wet towel over the mutual high-fivin’ party seeing that there is evidently a bigger lesson to be learned by America from all this — a lesson that many governments in Europe had already applied in aid of legislation in their respective countries.",Others
SIT DOWN! Leni Robredo’s DISHONEST response to Duterte’s opinion about female national leaders,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/sit-down-leni-robredos-dishonest-response-to-dutertes-opinion-about-female-national-leaders/,"So what if Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte thinks women don’t make good presidents? Well, at least we now all know what Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte really thinks. That’s way better than all those wokes out there who habitually signal the virtuousness of their “inclusive” pretensions but are less than virtuous — and far more exclusive — behind closed doors when clucking amongst their chi chi amigas.
More importantly, one’s gotta ask: How are those so-called “feminists” who assert that women can do a “better” job than men any different? Isn’t that being just as prejudiced as Duterte is being accused of? Take the latest ululation of “vice presdient” Leni Robredo, for example. Robredo, as expected, chimes in on the whole brouhaha over Duterte’s latest honest statement with her trademark dishonest take on the matter reportedly pointing out that the “best performing” states when it came to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic are all “led by women”.
“We’re surrounded by countries where the leaders are women. During the pandemic, the best-performing states were led by women,” she said, possibly referring to Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen and New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern who earned worldwide praise for successfully keeping COVID-19 cases down to a minimum in their countries. “We don’t have to address this point by point,” Robredo added.
Is there a scientific basis for this? Not by a stretch. Robredo makes use of a classic logical fallacy as bases for this recent dimwit Leni-ism — equating correlation to causation. Just because a woman happened to be a leader in a country that happened to be good at responding to the COVID-19 pandemic does not mean said women being leaders of said countries were the cause of the good handling of said crises there. The related fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc also applies — that just because a woman became leader of a state that went on to handle the pandemic crisis well does not necessarily mean said woman becoming leader caused that outcome.
Robredo basically stumbles all over herself to combat prejudice with prejudice in equal measure. Worse, she uses dishonest science to make her halfwit pronouncements!
It is also worth noting that Robredo’s dim brainwave is not even an original one. The whole dishonest idea that women leaders are “better” crisis leaders than men comes from Chinese “feminist” Leta Hong Fincher, author of, wait for it, Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China who, in an op-ed piece published back in April 2020 on, you guessed it, CNN made this laughable assertion:
In New Zealand, the prime minister took early action to shut down tourism and impose a month-long lockdown on the entire country, limiting coronavirus casualties to just nine deaths.
All three places have received accolades for their impressive handling of the coronavirus pandemic. They are scattered across the globe: one is in the heart of Europe, one is in Asia and the other is in the South Pacific.
But they have one thing in common: they’re all led by women.
The interesting thing about Fincher’s “observation” is that she notes that these countries are “all multi-party democracies with high levels of public trust in their governments”. Funny that. Fincher unwittingly shoots her very “thesis” that women leaders are better than men in the foot. If these states were all excellent high-trust states to begin with, then there will have been a higher probability that any leader of those lands — whether male, female, straight, gay, trans, or non-human — will have presided over a world-class crisis response just the same.
Leni Robredo essentially does a grave disservice to the feminist “movement”. A person of her stature associating dishonest rhetoric to an otherwise worthy cause degrades its credibility. If Robredo wants to be a noted feminist “thought leader”, she needs to school herself in modern thinking. Simply parroting other people’s thinking is downright mediocre statesmanship. Parroting wrong arguments makes her, quite simply, a fool. Feminists should do themselves a favour and tell Robredo and other moron virtue signallers like her to sit down and leave the feminism to to real activists.",Others

If you find yourself shaking your head as you behold the throngs of people in the above photos, think more of the subsequent report of senior citizen Rolando dela Cruz, 67, who was amongst them collapsing and later dying.
Dela Cruz was among those who fell in line at the community pantry that was organized for Locsin’s 36th birthday at a commercial building on Don Matias Street. Locsin briefly led the distribution of goods to those who were lined up and went live on Facebook before noon on Friday to say that stubs were given to those availing of the provisions.
Locsin later reportedly apologised for the tragedy, the chaos that led to it, and the inconvenience felt by residents of the areas affected by these enormous crowds. Reporter Jeline Malasig described the situation at the time surrounding the incident as “grim” which was consistent with Locsin’s own personal recollection…
Locsin said some residents who [did] not have stubs cut the line, causing further crowding.
“Nagpatulong rin po kami sa munisipyo na mabilis naman po ang pagtugon sa aming barangay din po. May mga pumunta rin po dito na mga pulis at saka mga military na tumutulong naman po pero ‘yun lang po, hindi lang po talaga nila ma-control ‘yung mga tao,” Locsin said.
(Locsin’s quoted Tagalog statement translates: “We requested assistance from the municipal authorities who were quick to respond. Some police officers and military personnel also came to help but really could not control the crowd…”)
The incident highlights the problem with initiatives like these which could attract a large crowd, at best posing an inconvenience to residents of affected neighbourhoods and, at worst, leading to loss of life and damage to property if said crowds turn unruly. Indeed, a crowd of desperate people is a tinderbox that could be set off by the smallest spark or altercation. More importantly, it puts into the spotlight earlier messages being sent out by Opposition “activists” and “thought leaders” who denounced efforts by the police to be present in areas where community pantries were springing up and local government authorities to apply regulatory oversight to these activities.
One example of this arrogance amongst key personalities in the Opposition is lawyer Rowena Guanzon, a commissioner in the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), who issued explicit threats on Twitter to flout local government regulation in her plans to set up her own community pantry.
Indeed this is behaviour unbecoming of a law practitioner. Guanzon seems to forget that laws and rules are in place to mitigate the risks of precisely the sorts of things that happened to Locsin’s initiative. “Activists” should see the lesson in all this and learn to be a bit more circumspect when demonising police officers and government officials who are merely doing their jobs.
As the Locsin incident shows, the public will more than likely always turn to state authorities and state forces for help when things get really problematic. It highlights just how dishonest the tired old Yellowtard (the bloc of Opposition partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and communist anti-police and anti-establishment rhetoric is. You can’t just dismiss the police and local authorities as the “bad guys”. Who are you going to turn to when things get out of hand? The New People’s Army?",Others
Incompetent CCTV Contractor Causes Water Service Interruption in 35 Barangays,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/incompetent-cctv-contractor-causes-water-service-interruption-in-35-barangays/,"A contractor hired by a government agency to install a  CCTV network was said to have caused the massive water service interruption affecting 35 barangays in the cities of Mandaluyong, San Juan, Pasig, and Quezon City.
According to a statement from Manila Water, this is the sixth time that the contractor damaged one of its water lines. Below is an excerpt from Manila Water’s statement:
“The breakage was caused by AWIN Technology, a third-party contractor doing CCTV network installation.
“Manila Water reports that this is not the first time that this contractor damaged water lines through the course of their work. Since last year, the same contractor caused breakages on water pipes at six (6) different sites in the East Zone, including last night’s, which was already the second incident for 2021.",Others
Aiko Melendez Kakalabanin Si Ate Rose Nono Lin Sa QC 5th District?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/aiko-melendez-kakalabanin-si-ate-rose-nono-lin-sa-qc-5th-district/,"Tila bigla-bigla na lang na nag-accounce si Ms. Aiko Melendez na babalik siya sa politika either as a candidate for Councilor or Congresswoman sa District 5. Nagulantang tuloy ang isa pang nag-aambisyon na maging councilor o congresswoman rin na si Ate Grace Nono Lin na mukhang malaki na rin ang naipuhunan sa maagang pangangampanya para sa mga naturang pwesto.
Bagamat matagal-tagal na rin na wala sa politika si Ms. Melendez, malakas pa rin ang recall ng pangalan niya sa usapang politika ng Quezon City. Isa itong three term councilor ng 2nd District ng Quezon City at tumakbo na bilang Vice Mayor na katuwang ni Mike Defensor nuong 2010.
Hindi man siya pinalad na maging Vice Mayor dahil natalo siya ng anak ni dating Mayor Sonny Belmonte na si Joy, eventually naging girlfriend naman siya ni Zambales Vice Governor Jay Khonghun.
Bilang councilor ng 2nd District ng Quezon City noon, naipagmayabang nito na in her three terms or nine years sa posisyon, DALAWANG multi-purpose hall ayon sa isang dating interview niya sa PEP.
“Ako, maipagmamalaki ko na may proyekto ako. Magugulat kayo na sa liit ng budget ko na yun, may multi-purppose hall ka na dalawa na pinapagawa and to think na ang district ko is the biggest in Quezon City… Hindi naman ako si Superman na magagawa ko lahat ng problema nila. But sa akin, I see to it that I do my job.”
Nasabi niya ito bilang pagsagot sa “biro” ng noo’y kandidato pa lamang sa pagka mayor na si Herbert Bautista. Nasabi diumano ni Herbert na “tamad” at “walang nagawa” si Ms. Melendez.
Hindi lang si Herbert ang pinuntirya ni Ms. Melendez, pati ang anak ni dating mayor Sonny Belmonte na si Joy eh tila nasabuyan rin niya ng maanghang na salita sa interview niya noon sa PEP.
Hindi ikinaila ni Aiko ang kanyang disgusto nang malaman niyang tatakbo bilang running mate ni Bistek si Joy Belmonte-Alimurung.
Ayon kay Aiko, kulang pa sa karanasan ang anak ni Quezon City Mayor Francisco “Sonny” Belmonte, habang siya ay three-term councilor na at kumuha pa ng crash course on Legislation sa University of the Philippines at kung paano maging isang mabuting vice mayor.
“Ako, wala kayong maririnig sa akin na bad about Mayor Belmonte because he has done so much for Quezon City. Siya ang isang rason kung bakit napaangat ang antas ng Quezon City. Tatay ang tingin ko kay Mayor Belmonte. Kaya lang, nung nag-usap nga kami nitong ano, last week, ang sabi niya sa akin, ‘I’m sorry.’
“Sabi ko sa kanya, ‘Sir, you don’t have to say sorry, Mayor. Kasi alam naman ninyo po na 2003 pa lang tumimbre na ako sa inyo. Sabi ninyo mag-Congress na ako nung nag-aaway kayo ng isang pulitiko. Sabi ko, hindi na. Ibigay ninyo na lang sa iba dahil ang gusto ko po maging vice mayor. Gusto ko po tapusin kasi itong Council.’ It’s legislative ‘yan, e. Yung nagpe-preside ka. Eto yung I love debating. I love questioning…
“Parang nagsabong kaming ‘dalawang’ anak niya. Ang problema lang ang paborito niyang anak si Joy, ako yung ‘anak sa labas.’ So sabi ko, ‘Mayor, with due respect, wala kayong maririnig sa akin na paninira kung ano ang ginawa ninyo. Ang punto ko lang is, ang pinanghahawakan ko is my experience.’
“Si Joy Belmonte-Alimurung, hindi siya tumapak ni sa Council, out of nowhere. It just so happens na anak siya ni Mayor Sonny,” madiing sinabi ni Aiko.
“Hindi lang ako yung accidental candidate na, ‘Ah, anak kita, halika ka, takbo ka dito.’ Tinapos ko ang termino ko, e. At saka tumimbre ako sa inyo na tatakbo akong vice mayor. Nag-take ako ng crash course sa U.P. Pinaghandaan ko lahat ng laban na papasukin ko para kapag may isyu sa akin na ibabato, ready ako.
“That’s why nga I’m insisting si Mrs. Joy Belmonte-Alimurung na sana if she really loves Quezon City and she has truly concern about the city, dapat as early as now, hindi dahil pinatakbo ka ng kung sino or dahil may kadikit ka na malaking pangalan sa likod mo, e, yun ang rason mo sa pagtakbo, mali!
Medyo nagulantang lang ako dun sa sinabi ni Ms. Melendez na waring anak rin siya ni dating Mayor Sonny Belmonte. So… bale ang tawag sa kanya eh “Baby”? Ganon ba?
Hay nakoh Ate Rose Lin, kung si Ms. Melendez nga ang isa sa mga makakatapat mo sa 2022 either sa council o as kandidato sa pagka congresswoman, mukhang kailangan mong kalamayin ng maigi ang loob mo.
Sa tabas pa lang ng pananalita nito na sinasabing WALANG MASAMANG SASABIHIN, panay asido naman ang tumatalsik mula sa bibig.
Kay Ms. Melendez naman, baka akala niyo eh parang dati ang pagtakbo sa posisyon ngayong sobrang tutok ng masa sa social media ngayon. Marami nang magaling mang-ungkat ng mga record ng mga opisyal at marami na rin ang mabilis ang kamay sa pagre-record ng video gamit ang cellphone.
Di po tulad ng dati na hindi pinapansin sa social media ang local government officials. Ngayon po, madali-daling magviral ang mga government officials na tamad o may sungay.",Others
Controversy surrounding Bong Go “protégé” Christopher Lao highlights Philippines’ dysfunctional civil service system,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/controversy-surrounding-bong-go-protege-christopher-lao-highlights-philippines-dysfunctional-civil-service-system/,"The brouhaha at the Department of Budget Management (DBM) caused by Senator Bong Go’s protégé Christopher Lao, former Undersecretary at the Presidential Management Staff–Office of the Special Assistant to the President, has brought to fore the issue of how political patronage and the bureaucracy contribute to the culture of corruption in government. It’s not wise to speculate on the outcome of the investigation into his alleged involvement in extortion but there is the issue of the appointment of unqualified individuals to government posts. The concept of civil service is the bureaucrats would be appointed on the basis of qualification standards and promotion given on the results of performance evaluation and continuing education. But this is not the case with our government. Undersecretary and Assistant Secretary positions are given out on the basis of the candidate’s “MBA” — May Backer Ako. This works both ways in case Sen. Franklin Drilon is reading this. His brother Cesar, has been a long-term appointee at the country’s de facto embassy in Taiwan, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO).
Senator Ping Lacson, for his part, has disclosed in several fora that he is not for new taxes in a bid to increase government revenues. He would rather ensure that the national budget allotments are spent for the specified purpose and that the practice of pork barrel funds for Senators and Congressmen is stopped. His proposal of adopting the zero-based budget process focuses on the need to determine outcomes after the time period for the allotment has expired. This is a variation of his proposed Budget Reform and Village Empowerment (BRAVE) Bill which specifies allotments of development funds to local government units (LGUs) up to the barangay level which is not subject to the control of the national government or the Congressmen of the LGU.
The development funds would be released on a quarterly basis to each local government unit (LGU). Under the bill, provinces would receive P500M – P1 billion per year, cities up to P200 million per year, municipalities P50 million to P100 million per year and barangays up to P3 million to P5 million per year. The local development fund (LDF) for each province, city or town will be based on the 50 percent of the prescribed amount for first-class LGUs, 60 percent of the prescribed amount for second-class LGUs, 70 percent of the prescribed amount for third-class LGUs, 80 percent of the prescribed amount for fourth-class LGUs, 90 percent of the prescribed amount for fifth-class LGUs, and 100 percent of the prescribed amount for sixth-class LGUs.
Lacson is also the first to propose the digitization of the bureaucracy in order to minimize corruption and speed up transactions of the public with government departments and agencies. This is essential in moving forward with the mindset that the pandemic is endemic and that lockdowns should be granular instead of covering a large area which hinders economic activities.
The Opposition, on the other hand, continue to indulge in politicking which is detrimental to the public interest. Vice President Leni Robredo’s “solutions” are nothing but PR stunts designed to make her popular but without much impact in addressing the needs of the public during this challenging time. Lacson’s scrutiny of the 2022 budget serves a specific purpose because if it happens that he and Senate President Tito Sotto emerge as winners in the May 2022 election, this is the budget they will be working with for the remainder of the year. This is why it is imperative on the public to focus on the issues in this election and not the sideshow that politicking brings. If only Vice President Leni Robredo would present a platform of government to the public like Lacson does. It’s easy to fall into the trap of negative campaigning but at this point, there is simply too much at stake. We need to find innovative and out-of-the-box solutions to the problems we face.",Others
When Anne Curtis-Smith asks “What’s the plan?” EVERYONE pays attention.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/when-anne-curtis-smith-asks-whats-the-plan-everyone-pays-attention/,"Filipinos have been on edge lately as the daily average number of confirmed COVID-19 infections has been breaching 10,000 the last several days. With hospitals bursting at the seams and lockdowns over the foreseeable future casting a grim pall over people’s lifestyles and livelihoods, people are looking for comfort and answers. Popular Australia-born starlet Anne Curtis-Smith offers something that many Filipinos now latch on to — a shoutout for a plan issued on Twitter.
In a subsequent tweet, Curtis-Smith adds, “it would be nice to be given more light on what is to happen while waiting for vaccines to arrive.. so with what hope we have left we can work together as a nation…”
Nice, right? Obvious questions do come across more fashionably authoritative when uttered by celebrities. “Reporter” Dana Cruz of the Inquirer certainly agrees noting that, “more celebrities are voicing out their observations on what they see as the government’s lack of effective pandemic response, including Janine Gutierrez, Liza Soberano and Albie Casiño.” Presumably, Filipinos for their part are really grateful that such chi chi showbiz stars are right on the ball to tell them these things.
Unfortunately, the Philippines is saddled by an enormous population. It is a country that hosts a people numbering far beyond what any local public service can serve sufficiently even in normal times, much less in a national disaster like a pandemic. Not surprisingly, Metro Manila is the most acutely-impacted by the pandemic thanks to its distinction of having the world’s highest population density. With thousands of small one-room shacks peppering vast swathes of steaming slums all over this megalopolis being home to several families, it is virtually impossible to contain the spread of COVID-19. Each one of such households is a virtual petri-dish where viral clusters likely form almost daily. And under a system where public administration is hopelessly federated across small local government units, the economies of scale required to efficiently co-ordinate consistent implementation of modern disaster response and crisis management measures are simply not there.
In short, Metro Manila is like a vast forest dried to a crisp in a drought that had been set alight. The inherent inability of the Philippines to deal with a pandemic of this scale was evident even back in May last year, 2020, when I wrote in my article “The best solution to combat COVID-19 is to NOT be poor”…
The fact is, the Philippines is not in a position to effectively deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in an equitable manner in much the same way it never actually ever had the capability to deal with any general disaster to begin with.
Brilliantly prescient writing right there. To be fair, however, the historical record provides ample evidence of how such a fragmented national governance frame consistently proves to be impotent in times of crisis. Back in 2013 as supertyphoon Haiyan devastated the city of Tacloban and killed more than 10,000 Filipinos in the span of just 2-3 days, then Interior Secretary Mar Roxas could only advise then city mayor Alfred Romualdez, “bahala na kayo sa buhay niyo” (“you people are on your own and your lives are in your own hands”) noting that the national government pretty much had its hands tied at the time navigating the legal minefield of intervening in local government crisis response activities.
In times like these, meagre resources need to be prioritised and even solutions that are mere compromises need to be implemented decisively. Metro Manila is clearly a massive biohazard to the rest of the country. Columnist Joel Ruiz Butuyan declared Metro Manila in his column today a fallen city that probably needs to lock in all of its residents lest they make like rats scampering off a sinking ship to infest hapless communities in the hinterlands…
There’s the increasing number of Metro Manila residents who are moving back to the provinces, and along with them, they’re bringing and spreading the virus. Provincial folk are wary of those who are arriving from Metro Manila, and their fears are not without basis. Categorized as “locally stranded individuals” (LSIs), Metro Manila residents are subjected to mandatory testing in the provinces, and many of them are turning out positive for the virus.
Worried that they would be quarantined in provincial facilities with decrepit accommodations, there are Metro Manila residents who try to secretly move back to their hometowns without reporting to municipal authorities.
Clearly, COVID-19 already has the National Capital Region (NCR) in its grip and there’s obviously the rest of the country to consider. Strong measures will likely need to be implemented to ensure Metro Manilans don’t pose a health hazard to Filipinos who don’t call Metro Manila home.
One wonders then if those “plans” that Manila’s chi chi “influencers” like Anne Curtis-Smith shrilly demand of the nation’s brains trust are to be framed within that context of the broader interests of the entire nation and not just that of Imperial Manila. We hear a lot of such “influencers” urging their followers to “self quarantine”. Perhaps there also needs to be a call for Metro Manila to be quarantined from the rest of the Philippines reminiscent of the movie Escape from New York.
So what’s the plan, people? Paki bilis bilisan niyong pagsagot — Anne Curtis-Smith is getting impatient! Hopefully plans that are forward-looking in nature given the current reality are acceptable to her royal highness.",Others
Imagine for a moment if Harry Roque was made to wait in a tent for COVID treatment…,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/imagine-for-a-moment-if-harry-roque-was-made-to-wait-in-a-tent-for-covid-treatment/,"Would the Opposition “thought leaders” currently screeching “UNFAIR!” be happy under such a scenario? Is a senior member of the Cabinet subject to the same prioritisation that ordinary Filipinos are? Think of it for a moment. If senior national government officials are to be placed in tents outside of hospitals come the time that they will be requiring treatment for COVID, what would that say about the Philippines as a society?
It seems the Opposition — particularly the Yellowtards (partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) who presume to “lead” them — don’t really know what they are talking about in turning presidential spokesman Harry Roque’s admission into hospital (supposedly jumping the queue for COVID-19-related admissions) into this week’s outrage fad. Then again, this is, after all, a partisan bloc enamored to the idea of top politicians and government officials directing traffic in the rain, proclaiming the dumb notion that “the people” are their “boss”, and walking around in tsinelas. What they seem to conveniently forget is top government officials by the very nature of their responsibilities and duties need to be given priority medical care.
If critics are going to demand “fairness” then they should demand that presidents live in squatter shacks, top officials not work in airconditioned offices and be chauffeured around in nice cars, that they eat pagpag, and take public transport to work everyday. They should also demand that every one of them queue for medical care in their respective barangay health clinics. Fair, right? Communists would certainly agree in theory although their practice of said theory has been revealed by history to be severely wanting.
One wonders then how the Yellowtards would position themselves if their idol “vice president” Leni Robredo got sick and required intensive medical care. Would they be happy to see her queued up for hospital care in a tent in the same way they demand of Roque? One wonders whether shills who are all shrill because the subject of their screeching is Roque would be as shrill, judgmental, and vindictive if it was Robredo who finds herself partaking of what a “vice president” is entitled in the scheme of medical attention priorities.
It is likely that the powers-that-be who have connections in the health care industry will likely scramble all over one another to offer dispensations to Robredo in such an event. It is also likely that the Yellowtards will gush over the “generosity” of these would-be gentlemen coming to the aid of a top damsel in distress and probably get the thousands of retweets and “likes” they covet when expressing this gushing on their social media timelines.
The question then extends to those who will likely offer a chi chi hospital bed and suite to Robredo in such a scenario. That would effectively take some of the accountability for jumping the queue off Robredo’s person and office. But it would also highlight how the same power in the private sector to broker favours with the Yellowtards by giving her that hypothetical hospital bed very much also comes at a cost to ordinary Filipinos queued for the same service.
See, there is no sidestepping the fact that top government officials will get preferred treatment and higher priority over ordinary citizens — much the same way as any other VIP will, specially in Philippine society. This will happen whether they like it or not (and they will be damned whether they partake or decline). For their part, Filipinos should reflect on how the treatment of a top official reflects on the sort of society they constitute. Filipinos are a people, after all, who see no qualms about treating their clergy like royalty (considering these are people who took vows of poverty and humility). They should, at least, be consistent about what they wax “outrage” over.",Others
Opposition MISTAKEN to think winnability of Duterte camp in 2022 goes down with Bong Go,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/opposition-mistaken-to-think-winnability-of-duterte-camp-in-2022-goes-down-with-bong-go/,"SBG. Senator Bong Go. The presidential aide who was basically chief of staff/executive assistant to the Mayor, Rodrigo Duterte, became the second most powerful man in the country after his principal won the Presidency in 2016. Aides have a long history of being equally or more powerful than their principals because they are the gatekeepers. They control not only the physical traffic flow but also the flow of information. It is a trust and confidence position specially for powerful men or women, such as the President of the Republic. Aides can be the most popular or also the most hated people among the President’s cordon sanitaire. It depends on who is the de facto primus inter pares among the cordon.
In the case of Go, he is with the President and is at his beck and call not only 24/7 but probably 25/8. It’s actually an achievement that Go managed to remain relatively unscathed as the President’s term is about to end. Men like Go are usually the main targets of competitors vying for the sought-after position they hold. The Executive Secretary is the de facto chief of staff of the President but Go is even more powerful than Salvador Medialdea. It isn’t surprising that the two forged an alliance against Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco, who is also close to the President. Evasco was the de facto Davao City Mayor. Duterte isn’t known for spending time in the office attending to the details. He had Evasco for that. As Cabinet Secretary, he was supposed to be the conduit between the President and the Cabinet. Medialdea was to run the Office of the President.
Ironically, it was also the Senators who brought Go upon themselves to become part of the chamber. The investigation into the frigate deal with Hyundai for the Philippine Navy over Go’s marginal note on the document sent to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana caused Go’s appearance before the Blue Ribbon Committee. That fishing expedition led the President to tap Go for a Senatorial run. It could be said that Duterte now had a conduit who would keep him well-informed about what the Senators were up to. Up until last week, there was no sign that Go’s relationship with his colleagues had become untenable.
The Commission on Audit (COA) flagging triggered the latest brouhaha between the Office of the President and the Senate. It can’t be said that there was no malice on the part of the COA considering audit findings aren’t final until a Notice of Disallowance has been issued. Also, the bureaucracy is notorious for non-compliance which triggers the findings to begin with. The anomalies are only confirmed when the agency or department cannot produce the documents justifying the transaction or defending themselves from non-compliance. The instances of corruption in the bureaucracy cannot be denied. It exists despite every President making the promise that it will be minimized if not completely eliminated. The problem is the bureaucracy itself which has gone from bad to worse since the post-Marcos period began. It can be said that everything was controlled when President Ferdinand Marcos was in power — including corruption. The democracy following his ouster also democratized everything — including corruption. This is why it now exists from top to bottom. Not all, of course, but mostly.
When it is the political season, anything goes in Philippine politics. There are Senators who are up for reelection. There are the political orphans who no longer have the backing of the parties they ran under six years ago because it lost the top race. There are the Presidential aspirants who still believe that negative campaigning will work against the incumbent. The recent US Presidential election proved an incumbent can be defeated if the pandemic response is used as an issue against him. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s actually guilty of what he is accused of. It just needs to look that way before the public. Duterte hasn’t been one to adhere to stereotypes. He continues to be popular and isn’t even a lame duck going into his last months in office. The Opposition had to do something. This is that something. It is an old strategy which is typical for them. But they continue to believe it will work in their favor.
It cannot be denied that there is a rift between the father and the daughter, Inday Sara. It does not appear to be contrived as those in the Opposition have openly speculated. Go is caught between a rock and a hard place but he knows where his loyalty lies. It is with the President. The Davao Originals are also reluctant to relinquish power which is why the Go-Duterte tandem came about. As voters, we should all be pragmatic about our politics. We should bear in mind that our politicians are products of a flawed system of government. If this wasn’t the case then we should be up there with Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. But we are not. Our power is only exercised every six years. We should use it wisely and judiciously. All this political theater is just that and nothing more. We should be used to it by now and not be swayed by the usual claims that one side is good while the other is evil. We are at a crucial juncture because of the pandemic. We should be more cunning and devious than our so-called leaders and make it known on May 2022.",Others
5 years of Leni Robredo’s little PR stunts don’t add up to REAL achievements that befit a NATIONAL leader,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/5-years-of-leni-robredos-little-pr-stunts-dont-add-up-to-real-achievements-that-befit-a-national-leader/,"Leadership has a pro-forma definition but for one to be called a leader, in the true sense of the word, one has to prove himself or herself first. Former President Cory Aquino was a leader. Look at her record during her tenure. Could that be described as effective leadership? Fidel Ramos followed suit. His much-bruited about attention to detail by his “Completed Staff Work” (CSW) requirement for all paperwork forwarded to his office is legendary. But what did he actually achieve? Joseph “Erap” Estrada didn’t have a chance from the beginning but his Cabinet was probably the best overall post-Marcos. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) achieved the impossible. She was able to bring out the best from the motley group she assembled after the resignation of the Hyatt 10; the Yellowidiots she had to accommodate because of her deal with Cory. GMA was and still is a leader. That’s why she is the most unpopular President. PNoy? Noynoy Aquino was a Boy-King made President. That’s all he was.
President Rodrigo Duterte has shown what he’s made of. Far from perfect but he has delivered on each of his promises except for federalism, which is what is needed now to finish off what he set out to do. Of the current crop of candidates being bandied about, Ping Lacson stands out. His expertise in the budget, experience in legislation and his knowledge of the inner workings of government while in its service qualifies him to run for the highest post again. For Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III (MLQ3) to suggest that Vice President Leni Robredo should step up to the plate in his piece “The widow might” is absurd. All he has to present by way of “achievements” Robredo has delivered to exhibit Quezon’s standard of “leadership” are initiatives that don’t befit the scale at which a national leader would be expected to work towards. Instead, they come across as mere PR stunts that compete with executives at local government levels and even non-government organisations (NGOs) for media mileage.
Do you still remember how the Vice President helped organize these volunteers? Or how the effort led her to release, for public use by anyone who’d care to use it, a template for people to follow, to make useful PPE? That was on March 29, 2020. On YouTube, you can still see the video of her visiting sewers in Bulacan on Aug. 5, 2020. This was the second wave of such efforts, mind you, at a cost of P378.37 per set. Do you remember her response, when the government, in imposing a lockdown, decreed a halt to all public transport? Free shuttle services complete with schedules were organized. And there were COVID-19 kits for citizens, the Swab Cab initiative, the Vaccine Express initiative, the free dorm effort when our frontliners were being ostracized and even evicted from their dorms, the Community Mart for consumers, and many more.
Robredo is a lawyer while Lacson is not but there is more sense from the Senator than the Vice-President when it comes to the issues of the day. Leni thrives in NGO-speak while Lacson is concise about what needs to be done. Robredo specializes in brokering donations from the private sector for the public; the laylayan that she claims to care for and serve. Quezon invented the phrase “the little office that could” to describe and refer to the Office of the Vice-President (OVP). Think again. The Php900 million annual budget of the OVP, is not little. To put that in perspective, a local city university with 8,000 students has an annual budget of P300M. If the office is that “little”, where does the bulk of the monies go? PS? MOOE? Capital Outlay? None of the programs the OVP has come up has been adopted by any government agency, department or LGU. None of it has been institutionalized because it’s not scalable. It is mostly for the VP’s PR machine.
Lastly, the VP hasn’t been able to keep any appointive position in government for at least six months. The main reason is she is not a team player. She acts as if she is not part of the Executive branch. As a lawyer, she should know better. As an economist, she also has no contribution at all. As a leader she has failed as the titular head of the Liberal Party as evidenced by their debacle in the 2019 election. Where is her political base at the national level if she really won over Marcos in 2016? Shouldn’t that be command votes in her favor? Robredo isn’t a leader. All the signs and evidence point to her being a fraud. She is a fraud. Plain and simple.",Others

This comes as Gordon heads the Senate blue ribbon committee “investigating” the deals of the Department of Health (DOH) related to the purchase of pandemic response facilities.
If, indeed, it was proven that some people made money at the expense of the taxpayers at a time of pandemic, we have enough laws to deal with that.
It is horrible to hear Duterte calling Gordon fat and throwing out innuendoes that damage the reputation of the local Red Cross as an institution.
Gordon merely heads the Red Cross and it cannot be denied that under his watch, the institution has expanded its activities to quickly respond to the needs of our disaster-prone country.
Dick Gordon is probably the only Ateneo alumnus who wanted the Presidency so bad but couldn’t make it. Noynoy Aquino beat him to it in 2010 and all he had to show was his provenance. We all have our biases so we cheer when Gordon roasts a Yellowidiot like in the Dengvaxia hearings and then hate him with a compunction when he turns and trains his guns on the administration. The difference lies in the proof or the evidence presented. In the Dengvaxia fiasco, the dots were all connected. The same with the Janet Lim Napoles “Disbursement Allocation Program” (DAP) scam and the bribery of Senators during the impeachment trial of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona. Of course the disentes didn’t raise a howl because that would be an admission of guilt. But as we came to know about them more, we found that their hypocrisy showed no bounds. They will bend and break the Constitution to suit their needs. All in the name of “good” versus “evil”. The ends always justify the means in their book. It helps also that the propaganda arm comes out swinging with accusations and “analysis.” The Opposition has Rappler for that. Even if there is no factual basis, their “reporting” is de facto “truth” in their minds. Maria Ressa shouldn’t wonder anymore why she’s been hit with libel cases. It really is libel within the definition provided in the Revised Penal Code.
Thing here is the Senators grandstand at our expense. It’s our centavo they’re fucking around with every time they go fishing in aid of reelection or in aid election to higher office. The Commission on Audit (COA) hasn’t released a notice of disallowance for their findings with reference to the DOH audit. Why? Because they still have time to address the issues. That’s the process. It has to be followed because it is in the Audit Manual. Healthcare workers are up in arms over their delayed special risk allowance. Part of the blame is on the COA too. I’m a government consultant at present and I haven’t been paid my professional fees for three months since I started and my engagement is only for six months. Even if I complain, the bureaucracy does not move. Come September 15, it will be four months that I haven’t been paid. It makes me wonder if our Senators are so stupid that they have no idea of how the system works. But that can’t be since they’ve been in government for the longest time. It leads one to ask the question, what’s all the fuss about?
In light of the pandemic, no one has clue about how to go about the campaign for 2022. No mass gatherings unless you can guarantee testing and proof of vaccination. So candidates have this huge headache because there won’t be much of the actual interaction with voters that happens in campaign rallies and sorties. A motorcade is the only option left unless the candidate is willing to learn to ride a motorcycle and do a tour of key cities in the country. The President has apologized to the public for his shortcomings on pandemic response yesterday. He has taken it upon himself to accept responsibility because he is the President. But he did get his licks in against the Senators. We will find out what office Gordon is aiming for by October 8 but he will most likely run for reelection to the Senate but not on the administration ticket that’s for sure.
What we should focus on is how to abolish the Senate and shift to a unicameral parliamentary system instead. The Senate is a waste of money. It makes more sense to have a parliament where the actual government is formed from its ranks. This was the original structure adopted by the Malolos Congress. It was only the Americans who rammed down this stupid bicameral legislature down our throats. It was reestablished in the 1987 Constitution as a control mechanism for the oligarchs and the political elite. The pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses in our political and economic sectors. These need to be addressed to deliver a more effective response to the disruptive nature of the pandemic. We can’t borrow our way to economic recovery. We need foreign capital to jumpstart the economy. Yet the legislature continues to sit on key legislation put forth by the Cabinet’s economic cluster. Under a parliamentary system, the Cabinet ministers are also members of parliament and they can introduce legislation that is more attuned to what the country needs. Under the present system, we’re at the mercy of roughly how many legislators, half of whom, at least, don’t know what their jobs actually are. This is why the 2022 election is crucial for our future and survival. We should elect candidates who present actual platforms with plans of action and not just the old motherhood statements.
The case is being made for Leni Robredo as the best option for 2022. If she’s the best then we’re doomed. She can’t even make a decision on whether she is running or not which highlights her lack of principle. It shows that she does not have the courage to stand by her convictions and make a stand during this crucial period in our history. There is a disconnect between her statements and her actions because she has said that the Philippines cannot afford another six years of a Duterte at the helm and, yet, she can’t make a categorical statement if she is running or not. This is not how a natural-born leader behaves. Yesterday, Erin Tañada tweeted his tweak of the Beatles classic, Let It Be, turning it into “Let Leni Be”. This does not suit Robredo. She is more of The Great Pretender.
If the Opposition can’t come up with an alternative platform and all they can do is put on a show at the Senate then they don’t deserve our vote. We should consider other options but it won’t really amount to much given the shallow talent pool. Even if Leni, Isko and Pac-Man ran together, their collective abilities still won’t amount to the point that it would make a difference.",Others
Filipino nurses aren’t paid well because there are just TOO MANY of them,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/filipino-nurses-arent-paid-well-because-there-are-just-too-many-of-them/,"Why blame the problem on the President immediately? Because it’s an election year. Thus it is easy to see the motivation behind PhilSTAR columnist Boo Chanco’s piece today “Show some appreciation” where he writes how, in these times of pandemic, “our health workers feel abused and unappreciated by the Duterte administration.” Chanco then issues his shoutout…
Why can’t Duterte use some of the billions he has in his discretionary funds (that incidentally require no auditing) to provide funding for the nurses if only to show some appreciation for their heroic work during this pandemic?
First there is the issue of supply and demand. Nursing used to be a thankless profession until the Western countries experienced a shortage of nurses. The nature of the Pinoy is kung nasaan ang pila, andun sila. So many took up Nursing. The schools couldn’t meet the demand so others started offering the course. Nurses need to do internship and residency. Soon the hospitals couldn’t accommodate all of them. I still have to research on the brouhaha over the Nursing Act of 2002 but Chanco’s insistence that the President can fund the salary shortfall from his intelligence fund has no basis since state-owned hospitals have line-item budgets under the Department of Health (DOH). It should be the DOH which should source the funds.
The P500 per day hazard pay is standard. That’s the same amount I received on top of my monthly contractual pay for my reporting for work everyday during the 90-day lockdown in 2020. It took all of six months for that to be processed and released. Government bureaucracy is convoluted at both the national and local level. Salaries are often delayed because the processing is still manual. Computers are only used for encoding. There is no custom software which does the processing.
Chanco goes further to share his two-cent opinion on nurses’ pay…
Our nurses also suffer low salaries in the private hospitals. They are even made to pay “training fees” so the nurses can get the experience needed to work abroad.
Chanco should understand that there is such a thing as salary standardization in the civil service and the qualification standard. Nurses would need to have post-graduate degrees in order to be promoted to the next higher salary grade. It is also not possible to give them a higher entry level salary grade because this would distort the civil service ranking and the salary standardization. As it is, step increases are given on an annual basis on terms of compensation without promotion as part of the salary standardization process. There would also be market distortion if the compensation at government hospitals is higher than private hospitals. This already happened in the education sector. The pay of the entry-level public school teacher is higher than a private  educational institution. There are more teachers who want to be employed by government but there are no permanent plantillas available.
It’s not good practice on the part of traditional media to lay the blame always at the President without bothering to present to the public all the facts about the issue.",Others
An Open Letter (of Apology) to My Toddler,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/an-open-letter-of-apology-to-my-toddler/,"On the occasion of “Fathers’ day”, while some dads are going to be receiving gifts or having dinners arranged for them, I opted to write my child an open letter that I hope she will read in the future. Here goes…
Dear child,
It is 2021. It has been quite a number of years since you came to me. The world around me became different the day you were born. Somehow, in your own little way, without you really doing it, you changed my outlook in life. Your existence gave me direction. You taught me to take things that matter much seriously and with urgency. You caused me to limit my priorities to things that are truly beneficial. All else are either secondary or doesn’t even deserve a pinch of attention.
While I could say good things for myself when you came out to this world, I don’t think I can say the same for you.
First of all, I’m sorry that you were born a year before the Covid-19 pandemic. I’m sorry that you cannot enjoy what we as children use to enjoy back then – play in the park, the beach, and other outdoor places. You cannot and must not do it for now lest you get infected with the Covid-19 virus. I’m sorry that your right to enjoy the outdoors and be a normal kid is disrupted by some irresponsible person or persons who cannot help themselves but consume an animal that we don’t usually consider edible. I’m not aware why they did it but perhaps it’s because of hunger. They were so hungry that they would eat anything. Little did they know, what they consumed would cause a global halt in general human activities. Actually, I find it hard to believe that story since some people think that that country is considered a superpower now. Having trouble equating poverty with being a superpower nation? Me too. Anyway, I’m sorry for ever making you live with such human beings.
Second, I’m sorry that you were born in a helpless nation. Yes, we have a lot of pride; we are told (or molded into thinking) that we have a lot of things to brag about. We have beauty queens that won fame in international competition; we have boxers, and other athletes that brought what most people consider as honor to our nation. Unfortunately, my dear, the very people that you are living with right now failed to convert that “honor” and “fame” as motivation to strive for much better greatness. Yes, we have an 8-division boxing champion. Thanks to him, we have days virtually crime-free whenever he’s in a bout. But we don’t have a solid armed forces who can always do battle with other nations anytime, anywhere when confronted. You know, in the western part of our country, you have a big reserve of oil that could have given you a bright future. I’m sorry my dear, that part of our country is occupied by a foreign power. I guess that “bright” future of yours became dim because of that foreign power. Actually, never mind that foreign power. I’m sorry that you were born in a nation with a government that isn’t really that skilled in foreign relations and national defense build-up.
Third, I’m sorry that you were born in a country where corruption is rampant. A few years ago, a number of politicians were involved in a P10 billion scam known as the PDAF scam. A few more years back and we have the P728 million Fertilizer Fund Scam. Recently, we have the P15 billion scam at Philhealth. If taken together, imagine how many schools could have been built for you and children your age with that amount; imagine how many hospitals could have been built where we can take you if you get sick; imagine how your life would have been better because of the infrastructures that were built out of that lost money. I’m sorry for the lost money, and I’m sorry for we have such greedy, bottom-feeder, heartless, thick-skinned, power-hungry, money-hungry… crooks. Lastly, I’m sorry that none of the politicians who were involved in those are suffering the consequences of their act. On the contrary, most of them are still in power or are enjoying their retirement.
Fourth, I’m sorry that I allowed you to live in a society that seems to be focused on all the wrong things. Yes, we have an endless supply of entertainers, but we don’t have a supply of our own Einsteins, Ramanujans, Curies, and Pythagoras. Even I suffered the same hunger to be fed with knowledge that shaped these persons. I’m sorry that the schools that are considered the “best” in our country are the most expensive. I find it funny though that considering that they are expensive (and often hard to get in), their global ranking doesn’t really fit what they charge. So I’m sorry if I send you to a state university that charge less. Anyway, I’ll try to fill in what they will fail to teach you.
Fifth, I’m sorry that I allowed you to live in a country where religion and oligarchs have a hand in shaping those in power. As an example, you know, our nation is just one of two that still don’t allow divorce. I don’t know with the other but in our case, the Bible is frequently used as an excuse for that. It’s funny because the Bible itself allows it for at least one ground. I’m sorry for some of your future playmates if their parents are going to suffer because of the whims of a few. I’m sorry too that I made you belong to a society that allows (and often promotes) blind adherence. I will do my best to teach you to develop discernment but when you’re on your own, be careful who you listen to about religion and spirituality. Even the devil has its own religion.
Sixth, I’m sorry that whenever we drive around, we are always at risk of accidents caused by kamote drivers. If I were to choose, I would have not let you see counter-flowing, reckless, speeding, cutting-in-line  or just plain-stupid public utility vehicle drivers, motorcycle riders, and even private car drivers (this include irresponsible car owners who use the sides of the streets as their personal parking spaces). But I have no choice. Please note though that not all drivers are like that, my dear. Some of us strive to follow traffic rules because we are responsible, civilized people living in a suppose to be civilized society. Your father is a licensed driver, therefore, I always act like one – on and off the road. When you’re of age and earned your own driver’s license (the right way), cherish it; value it. It’s a privilege not a right. You have the obligation to behave as a responsible driver.
Finally, if you were to choose a career, let being a lawyer be the last in your choices. We have so many of them already. In fact, most of our government officials are lawyers. With the current status of our country, I guess that says a lot. Be something else.
I will still do my best to teach you about serving your country. But if you refuse, I can’t blame you.
Love,
Daddy",Others
Acting DPWH Sec. Oging Mercado Booted Ahead of BBM’s June 30 Inauguration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/acting-dpwh-sec-oging-mercado-booted-ahead-of-bbms-june-30-inauguration/,"Department Secretaries “leaving” before the end of the term of the President that appointed them usually isn’t newsworthy or even noteworthy. However, in the case of acting DPWH Secretary Oging Mercado, it seems he was booted out of office right after the wash of controversies that started plaguing his appointment almost from day one.
No one would have known that Mercado was given the old heave-ho back to the boonies of Leyte long before the assumption of DPWH Secretary designate Manny Bonoan had not someone from deep within DPWH misrouted a memo from Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea appointing DPWH Senior Undersecretary Rafael C. Yabut as Officer In Charge on June 23.
Word is that Mercado’s shenanigans and controversial dealings angered President Rodrigo Duterte, causing the old man to order his swift and immediate expulsion as acting DPWH secretary.
This is a whole seven days ahead of Secretary designate Bonoan’s first day in office, when he would be able to have full access to all of his department’s records — especially those pertaining to the transactions entered into by Acting Secretary Mercado.
Seven days is plenty of time for Mercado to hide or dispose of all the documents, which, according to sources, if put under proper scrutiny should compel a lengthy investigation not only by the Secretary designate but perhaps also the oversight committees in both houses of congress.
According to several published news reports and opinion articles Mercado was able to accrue all authority to approve projects, budgets and bid awards. The articles sources say that for 7 to 21 percent of the project cost, Mercado could guarantee that the project would be awarded to anyone who could bring him the money.
Word is that Mercado had counted on his Romualdez connections to assure that he would get designated or appointed by the Marcos Junior administration as the DPWH Secretary.
There might have been some manner of bounty sharing offered in exchange for staying as DPWH Secretary but as it turns out, this was unnecessary. As it turns out, the people he was counting on were merely humoring him and they had known that Mercador was on his way out.
Some sources close to the Marcoses were heard to have said that they found Mercado’s style repulsive and that this ran counter to what the incoming administration wanted to demonstrate within its first 100 days.
The last thing President elect Bongbong Marcos wanted was to have corruption allegations exploding before he could even sit in his dad’s former office.
In a sense, acting Secretary Oging Mercado’s face got slapped left and right or in local parlance, “nabigyan ng mag-asawang sampal sa mukha”.",Others
"Filipinos need to put politics aside, work TOGETHER, and ignore Opposition demolition campaigns",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/filipinos-need-to-put-politics-aside-work-together-and-ignore-opposition-demolition-campaigns/,"The administration has again come under fire from the Opposition for its pandemic response. Just when you think they had it down pat, they didn’t. Again. The country was the last in the region to experience a Delta-induced surge and so we’re also leading in the number of daily cases again. The past three days have seen record numbers being tallied. Good that they’re mostly mild or asymptomatic. Bad because the Opposition uses it against the administration. It’s election season obviously.
It doesn’t help that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) can’t seem to make up its mind about how to respond to Delta. They did have enough time to prepare for it. Unfortunately, contingency planning is one of the weaker points of the IATF-EID. To the layman, it sounds simple enough. But try sitting in a meeting where there are at least twenty officials in attendance. You will hear some innovative and some outright stupid ideas being proposed. It’s not a surprise then that the leak about granular lockdowns from Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon Lopez was reported by media even if it didn’t have any details.
Then you have the IATF-EID announce a change to general community quarantine (GCQ) for the National Capital Region (NCR) which was met with the usual backlash from the Opposition — they who complain either way when it comes to GCQ or enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), with or without ayuda, preferably with, to make it appear they are “fighting” for those most affected. This is what has the government reeling. The Opposition is forcing it to fight a battle on several fronts at the same time. The passive-aggressive stance of the Opposition is symptomatic of narcissistic personality disorder. I’m not kidding. Read about it and you will see that the symptoms are classic.
There are a lot of factors to consider in granular lockdowns. Truth be told even the subsequent ECQs weren’t as strict as the first one. It’s no surprise then why we are recording an increasing number of new cases. The economy is shot. Inflation is running high. Interest rates are about to go up because the US is also experiencing inflation due to the Democrats’ policies. The US not only has a record budget deficit. It also has record numbers for debt levels and trade deficit. It does not help that after October 8, the political temperature will be going up several notches higher as the cast for the 2022 election is completed.
Government and the private sector should sit down and talk about digitization. Covid is endemic. There’s no use in thinking herd immunity is attainable given the prevalence of the Delta variant. The private sector should spend for the testing of its employees. A vaccine mandate should be issued. Vaccination should be ramped up nationwide. The administration has been focusing on public health and the economy. Education can’t afford to take the backseat anymore. Public educational institutions are seeing record enrolment numbers again and private schools are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. There should be a dialogue between government and private educational institutions. Maybe the government can issue vouchers for private schools to pick up the overflow from state universities and colleges. This will give private schools some breathing room until limited face-to-face classes can be piloted.
The Department of Transportation (DOTr) should also address the issue of mobility. There is no physical distancing enforced in public utility vehicles (PUVs). Jeepneys should not be allowed to ply their routes anymore. The drivers can be retrained to become delivery riders for which demand is still high. There should be route rationalization so that feeder routes to the light rail system can be organized on an intermodal point-to-point basis. Once MRT-7 is operational, the Edsa bus carousel should be scrapped. Definitely the NCR transport system should be designed in a manner that conforms with the observance of minimum health protocols.
There are a million and one details which government needs to address. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats aren’t capable of outside-the-box thinking. It doesn’t help also that other sectoral representatives go out and leak videos of the IATF-EID meetings when discussions become heated. All this is in aid of politicking for the Opposition. This kind of behavior shouldn’t be tolerated. We can’t call on media to be responsible because they are on the side of the Opposition and will do whatever it takes to get the public to turn against the administration. The success of granular lockdowns is on the local government units (LGUs). Unfortunately, the LGUs have shown that they aren’t good for much either. The NCR mayors couldn’t even adopt a uniform contact-tracing system. There is no digital vaccination card. What they give you is a piece of printed cardboard. This also holds true for national government departments which are part of the pandemic response under the IATF-EID.
The Opposition would like to blame this all on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte but they conveniently forget it was they who were in power before. So this is on them. Covid will not go away should Vice President Leni Robredo become the President through whatever means. The pandemic response will not get any better because you can’t build hospitals in thirty days. The same is true with the government bureaucracy. The Opposition can’t even come up with stop-gap measures. They’re only good for PR stunts to make it appear they’re doing something that works. If that were the case, then why isn’t it being adopted by the LGUs?
It’s time to put our critical thinking caps on because the Opposition is preying on the public with its victim mentality approach. We should show them that this and their other traditional demolition methods, don’t work anymore.",Others
Marcos Jr.’s foreign policy mirrors the Philippines’ realpolitik,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/marcos-jr-s-foreign-policy-mirrors-the-philippines-realpolitik/,"More than a hundred days had passed since Ferdinand Marcos Jr. became the country’s president after his unprecedented electoral victory. As the country’s chief architect of foreign policy, the Marcos Jr. administration has embarked on various foreign travel commitments last September. His first destination was Jakarta, where he met Indonesian President Joko Widodo and discussed various avenues of cooperation between Indonesia and the Philippines. Later, he went to Singapore and met with his Singaporean counterparts, as he attempted to draw in investment pledges for the country. Afterwards, the president spent roughly a week in New York, where aside from his speech in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), he also met up with various businesses, investors, and politicians. All these travel commitments of the current administration in just a month is reflection on how the president will steer the Philippines beyond the tumultuous waves of global politics.
Our neighboring archipelagic nation of Indonesia as President Marcos Jr.’s first destination for his state visit was definitely a pleasant surprise. It is worth noting that both Jakarta and Manila share numerous common interests, where cooperation is of utmost importance. These would include addressing existential threats like terrorism, extremism, and climate change, where both these countries have ended up becoming victims in various occasions. As the two largest Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states in terms of population, economic partnership between Jakarta and Manila holds tremendous potential, most specially when one considers that a market shared by nearly 400 million Indonesians and Filipinos is too difficult for international investors to resist. With Jakarta serving as the de facto leading nation-state in the ASEAN region, developing and maintaining close ties with this country is critical to respond accordingly in the ever changing tides of geopolitics.
Visiting the highly-urbanized city-state of Singapore was also a no-brainer for the Marcos Jr. administration. Aside from the fact that Singapore employs thousands of Filipinos who contribute to various sectors of the Singaporean economy, it also serves as the investment hub of Southeast Asia. This state visit served as a testament not only to the government’s commitment to protecting overseas Filipinos, but also to the government’s active attempts to attract investments to the country. Even though structural and institutional reforms are required in the Philippines to become a more attractive investment option in the region, economic growth and job creation has been the primary objective of the Marcos Jr. presidency, most specially in the manufacturing sector where the country currently lags the most. To facilitate generation of employment opportunities, finding the right balance in incentivizing foreign investors and protecting labor rights of Filipino workers is key.
Why then did President Marcos Jr. choose Indonesia and Singapore as his first two destinations for his state visits and not Washington nor Tokyo, who share deep bilateral relations with Manila? It definitely boils down to ASEAN becoming a more significant regional organization, as the Indo-Pacific region is sandwiched by Beijing and Washington’s strategic competition for resources and influence. With the Philippine head of state affirming his relationships with Jakarta and Singapore, it sends a positive message of commitment to the ASEAN community. Even though it doesn’t have the political clout similar to that of the European Union, the whole ASEAN community is poised to maintain strong economic growth, even though its member-states’ respective state institutions are far from being inclusive in comparison to its European counterpart.
The second half of September of the Marcos Jr. administration was spent in New York City, where he delivered his speech in the UNGA. He mentioned that the Philippines’ wishes to be “friends to all, enemies to none”, where aside from adopting an independent foreign policy, cordial bilateral and multilateral relations between different nations would be pursued through dialogue, cooperation, and mutual trust. He articulated the contribution of the Philippines to this international organization through the actions of the renowned Filipino statesman, Carlos P. Romulo. Aside from that, he has also mentioned three threats to human security, which are food insecurity, energy crisis, and climate change. These three issues that he has mentioned in UNGA are areas where various nation-states can cooperate, as they serve as significant threats that will confront even the sheer existence of these countries, governments, and peoples.
Beyond the United Nations, President Marcos Jr. had also engaged in various meetings inside New York, which would include multinational companies, venture capitalists, and other heads of state. Aside from meeting US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his interview in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was generally well-received. He wooed businessmen to invest in the Philippines, saying that current Philippine demographics paired with the government’s plans to digitize its services, will be greatly beneficial to both parties. Attracting foreign capital as means to utilize local labor is a perfect recipe for a more pluralistic kind of economic growth, which is something that the country direly needs.
As a part of the Philippine delegation, the president brought his economic team in his foreign travel. Despite the various threats that can hamper economic growth, the presence of the economic team is a way of demonstrating the country’s sound economic fundamentals, which include a predictable currency, solid foreign exchange reserves, and low unemployment rate. Engaging with other foreign dignitaries and non-state actors in the field of economics, reflects an evolution of Philippine national policy in the form of economic diplomacy, and this is something that the Philippines can take advantage of.
As a capital-hungry county, the government’s agenda is to prioritize the entry of foreign direct investments, and this becomes further emphasized with the president himself acting aggressively in attracting overseas businesses and corporations. As the Philippines is renowned in the global market for sending human resources abroad, international businesses and other nation-states have greatly realized the importance of Philippine labor. With a relatively low cost of living in comparison to other countries, and with a young workforce coupled with the government’s pledges to continuously invest in infrastructure, everything looks promising for the Philippine economy.
Despite these pledges of investment worth billions of dollars, they are mere promises that should be delivered, and the Philippines has a significant active role to play to see them to fruition. Creating a business-friendly climate entails various systemic and structural changes, if these corporations are to generate employment opportunities for local Filipinos. This begins with economic liberalization by removing these highly restrictive constitutional provisions that discourage the entry of these multinational companies. The 60-40 system when it comes to ownership has been counter-productive because local Filipino businesses were greatly protected from international competition. As a result, they have developed oligopolistic tendencies, and thus, these foreign direct investments instead of going to the Philippines, end up driving the economic growth of other Asian countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. It is no wonder that the manufacturing sector of the Philippines cannot compete with other countries.
Generally speaking, President Marcos Jr. has strategically capitalized on the gains earned from the previous Duterte presidency’s pragmatic approach in foreign policy. This bodes well as the Philippines treads its own independent policy in pursuing, promoting, and protecting its national interests. Hopefully, this tightrope act would deliver prosperity and lift our very own local Filipinos out of poverty.",Others
A Philippine parliament holds a better future for Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/09/a-philippine-parliament-holds-a-better-future-for-philippine-politics/,"The recent demise of Queen Elizabeth II has been the headlines of all international news agencies. For more than 7 decades, she has served as the head of state of the United Kingdom and other nation states, which includes Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The second Elizabethan era has witnessed Britain decline in power and influence, as various British colonies eventually declared their independence from London. Her reign has seen various American, British, and Russian heads of government, from Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, to Biden, Truss, and Putin. Due to her unwavering commitment to public service, her immense contributions to the British public were well received, including her capacity as the previous leader of the Commonwealth of Nations. The masses of the people in the UK have long identified themselves with the queen, as long queues of locals and even foreign dignitaries pay their respects to her. In addition, she has also been Britain’s most well-respected diplomat in modern history. With the passing of the longest serving British monarch, the UK is a nation filled with both grief and gratitude.
The British monarchy has also their own share of mishaps and controversies in its long history. Colonialism, imperialism, mercantilism, piracy, and slavery left their strenuous marks in global political economy. Nevertheless, the monarchy has served as Britain’s dignified institution, according to Walter Bagehot’s “The English Constitution”. Another institution was also mentioned by Bagehot mentioned in his book, and it is about the British parliament. This efficient institution, where the executive and legislative powers of the government are merged through 10 Downing Street, confronts and tackles the predicaments of the nation. Such brand of British democracy has been copied and adopted not only by its European neighbors, but also by other countries with great success. This leads us to question what makes the UK parliament an attractive system of government.
A parliament is basically an assembly of representatives from various administrative jurisdictions and sectors of the society. It is chaired by a prime minister or a chancellor, and usually serves as the head of the dominant political party. As the chairperson, such politician is raised to this position through consensus, concessions, and consolidation. In a parliamentary system, the executive powers of the prime minister and his cabinet is merged with the legislative powers of the parliament, since they are also legislators hailing from their respective constituencies. Merging these governmental powers are helpful in creating efficient and effective laws. On the other hand, the parliament itself becomes its own device of checking and balancing the administration through the opposition. The formation of a shadow government by the opposition ensures accountability through debates held in the parliament, as they attempt to contest possible excesses of the current administration.
In the Philippines, the country has been following the American style of government through its presidential system. The president acts as the head of state and as the head of government. With the presidential system, executive powers are bestowed to the president, where the chief executive acts separately with the legislative branch of government. This works well when both the president and the majority of the legislators are politically aligned, but wreaks havoc when they act in completely opposite directions. In turn, this can lead to more political volatility and power abuse. These instances have been observed multiple times in the political histories of both the United States and the Philippines. It becomes worse when these politicians harbor political ambitions in vying for higher positions in the government.
These political gridlocks, which are more commonly observed in presidential-type of government systems, has been detrimental as threats of impeaching the president are being entertained in congress. Even though impeachment trials are afforded by the constitution as a check-and-balance mechanism, such issues can be greatly politicized and sensationalized. With such, politicians are incentivized to engage in leveraging themselves to pursue their personal interests, putting accountability in the backseat. Graft and corruption become the names of the game, as chief executives create and device nefarious machinations that purchase the loyalty of these legislators. In such a system, chances of politicians colluding instead of making themselves accountable greatly increase, as rule of law deteriorates to rule by law. This presidential system of government can also be attributed as one of the reasons why the most politically unstable, economically destitute, and societally chaotic countries are in Africa, South America, and Central America.
If the Philippines wishes to rectify the mistakes of the presidential system, it would entail changing the current charter. However, there are numerous pundits who continue to treat the current 1987 constitution as something that should be completely preserved, as if it was made by infallible human beings. In addition, there are individuals who are hesitant in changing the system of government to a parliamentary-type, due to reasons that are related with the current Philippine society. These would include the presence of an undereducated electorate, incompetent and corrupt lawmakers, and political dynasties. These social dilemmas become points of contention why Philippine politics remains dirty and that the parliamentary system should not be adopted, but these problems are mere by-products of an outdated system vis-à-vis the 1987 constitution.
When the eventual great powers of Britain, Germany, and Japan adopted a parliamentary government, did these nation-states have a significant educated or literate populations from the beginning? Initially, males of age from the landed gentry and mercantile groups were the ones afforded with the right to suffrage, and was later expanded to include laborers, women, and the marginalized. It was primarily due to their continued government investment in the fields of education and science that gradually made their cities highly productive. In addition, most of their lawmakers were initially from aristocratic families, who yielded power and influence in their respective localities. As a burgeoning middle class developed, they openly challenged these elites and eventually joined the political ranks in London, Berlin, and Tokyo. Even though various political families still hold a certain degree of influence in their parliaments, it is a far-cry from the semi-feudalistic political system that can be observed in the Philippines, where their political careers end up becoming their own businesses.
Adopting a parliamentary system in the Philippines will not change the whole archipelago overnight. However, it sets the tone in creating state institutions that responds to the needs of the society. A parliamentary system will compel politicians and their corresponding political parties to shape up. But with the country’s lengthy history with directly electing presidents, a paradigm shift would be greatly needed. With a Philippine parliament, there would be more inclusive political institutions that will eventually create an atmosphere of accountability, competence, and receptiveness to the plights of the Filipino people.",Others
On the failure of the Philippine government to respond to and manage COVID-19 consistently at all levels,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/on-the-failure-of-the-philippine-government-to-respond-to-and-manage-covid-19-consistently-at-all-levels/,"If there is an albatross on the President Rodrigo Duterte’s back since the start of the pandemic, it has to be the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). I don’t keep track of quarantine classifications anymore because it makes my head spin. Much worse, they’re not followed anyway, except for the first lockdown when it was strictly enforced. I have a friend who went to the US for the holiday season last year. He said he would be back in February. It’s now June and he’s still in the US. He and his family are fully-vaccinated. The perks of dual citizenship. But he doesn’t want to come back just yet because of the quarantine upon arrival even for those who have been vaccinated. More than likely he will spend the whole year in the US if quarantine restrictions on returning residents aren’t relaxed.
Actual experience in contact-tracing is also a nightmare. QR codes are now required in establishments. Problem now is the establishments don’t provide their security guards with scanners. Apparently there is no sense of urgency among owners to enforce the requirement. Why? Because government doesn’t enforce it as well. We experienced the surge in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+) last March through May. The daily case count hasn’t gone down because the regions are now affected. Test, trace and treat is still not the default. There is no unified system for those who have been vaccinated to show proof.
It’s become a game of finger-pointing between the IATF-EID and the local government units (LGUs) when it comes to vaccine availability. The LGUs haven’t adopted technology to solve the glitches in the registration process. I’m not surprised anymore because my short government stint exposed me to the realities of the bureaucracy. When you have incompetent and unqualified employees this is the result. It actually depends on the mindset of the Mayor to solve the problem. But most of the time this is passed on to the chief aide, who also doesn’t have a clue. The public ends up suffering because they are at the mercy of “public servants” who don’t serve but make life difficult for the public instead.
PhilSTAR columnist Boo chanco pointed out today, “the failure to explain the rationale for rules cause confusion and loss of confidence in government.” In this respect, the President has failed. He actually needs to sit everyone, including the LGU heads, down if the system is to improve. The basic problem is not everyone who is in government is up to the task or doing the assigned task. This is the best argument for a change in political structure. This is the best solution to resolve the gridlock combined with the digitization of the bureaucracy. If you want to minimize corruption, there should be less human intervention. Blockchain is the answer. COVID-19 is not going to go away anytime soon. A McKinsey study I read the other night puts much emphasis on digitization and smart technology to move forward in the present environment.
This is why the next President has his or her work cut out for him or her. We will not get onto the path to economic recovery without significant reform and without adapting to the requisite changes which need to be put in place. We need more officials who are critical, out-of-the-box thinkers who can provide the best solutions to the myriad of problems we face. It cannot be business-as-usual. We need to have a concrete strategy moving forward. The old normal is history. The future is already here.",Others
"Opposition coalition @1Sambayan’s REAL agenda: oil, gas, and Manny Pangilinan’s wealth",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/opposition-coalition-1sambayans-real-agenda-oil-gas-and-manny-pangilinans-wealth/,"Artemio Panganiban in his Inquirer piece today “Knowing what drives China in SCS” provides an informative summary of the historical background of the claims by parties in the South China Sea. He sets the theme with a very important context…
To begin with, China avows a long and glorious history that rivals Egypt and its pharaohs, and Greece and its Olympic gods. From the mid-1800s up to the mid-1900, however, China experienced a harrowing decay that forced her to accept shameful, one-sided treaties and the cruel treatment of its nationals. To the traditional Chinese, losing face is worse than losing life.
Seeing things from that perspective makes it easier to see why China is working hard to gain back ground lost over a timeframe most Filipinos fail to grasp. It possesses the might to aggressively work towards achieving that aspiration but, as Panganiban points out, China remains “surrounded by unfriendly and hostile neighbors: Russia on its north; former Soviet republics on its west; India and Vietnam on its south; and Japan, South Korea, and its renegade “province” of Taiwan (all three have defense agreements with the US) on its east.”
What’s significant is Vietnam has the most garrisons in the contested islands but still is not as belligerent to China as what one would have expected. Vietnam has experienced actual conflict with China in the Paracels in the late 70s and actual border conflict on land in the 80s. They understand they’re at a disadvantage so they tread carefully. Vietnam’s foreign policy is aligned in a similar manner as other ASEAN member countries. They prefer to stay within the umbrella of the regional agrrupation. It does not make any sense not to.
This makes you wonder why the Opposition led by former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario keep on pushing for a belligerent stand against China as was the posture during the administration of former President Noynoy Aquino. That didn’t get us anywhere. It didn’t even gain us brownie points with Uncle Sam in terms of defense materiel and equipment. All we got was another refurbished coast guard cutter and a marine exploration vessel.
What Carpio doesn’t make public is their intent to bring the country back into the US orbit to serve as its mouthpiece in the region. This doesn’t offer any strategic advantage in terms of the the economy and defense. China is now our biggest trading partner in terms of exports and imports. The economy would be the first to suffer. Filipino domestics in Hong Kong would be affected by stricter regulations if China turns the screws on us.
Carpio’s fight is not about sovereignty but more the interests of Manny Pangilinan in oil and gas exploration in the Recto Bank. Carpio’s constant tirades against the administration has the goal of having the public elect a President who would be favorable to his patrons interests. Carpio has no genuine concern for the Filipino people at all.",Others
Does a weakening peso mirror weakening economic fundamentals?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/11/does-a-weakening-peso-mirror-weakening-economic-fundamentals/,"A number of weeks ago, Filipino netizens reacted explosively towards Ilocos Norte Representative Sandro Marcos’s comments regarding the weakening Philippine Peso (PHP) against the US Dollar (USD). Quoting the neophyte congressman, “The peso is weak, not because that it is weak, but because the dollar is strong.”. These words became meme fodder for Filipino netizens, denigrating what they’ve decided is the younger Marcos’s limited intellectual abilities. In hindsight, are these tirades true, or can they be thrown back to these pundits who seem to have no degree of comprehension as to how monetary policy works? Nevertheless, this graduate of London School of Economics definitely knows what he is saying about economic policies and foreign exchange rates.
Monetary policy is an economic policy that is in the hands of the Central Bank. Its key lever one that is used to control of interest rates. These interest rates directly affect the ease of borrowing money, where it would also affect how easy it would be to pay credit card bills and housing mortgages. From a macroeconomic perspective, low interest rates incentivize creation of businesses and generation of employment opportunities. Technically, this is called quantitative easing, where money is virtually created out of thin air through the central bank. On the other hand, high interest rates aid in curbing inflation and is a traditional tool in attempts to control an overheating economy. This would be called quantitative tightening, where money supply becomes more regulated by the central bank.
Central banks all over the world bear responsibility for monitoring and controlling inflation of their respective currencies. Generally, a 2% inflation rate is ideal, where money moves relatively well in an economy that grows under optimal conditions. When the inflation rate go below 0%, the situation is called deflation, where basic commodities become cheaper through time. It sounds tempting to have more affordable items in the market, but deflating currencies discourage consumers from purchasing goods and services, which can lead to unemployment and may hamper economic growth. This can be observed with the Japanese Yen (JPY), where its economy seems to have floundered since the 1990’s. The Bank of Japan continually attempts to intervene through quantitative easing measures, where they increase the supply of JPY in the market by issuing zero or near-zero interest rates, even until now. Despite this, consumer price indices all over the world, which serve to measure inflation, have consistently risen in numerous countries for the past months.
Rising global inflation rates can be attributed to three possible reasons. The first reason would be the massive programs instituted to stimulate the economy during the pandemic, which compelled finance ministries and central banks to engage in quantitative easing measures. This increased money supply were paired with economies that didn’t deliver the promises of productivity, thus spurring up inflation rates. Supply chain bottlenecks, specially for semiconductors and electronic gadgets can be the second reason. With Beijing still applying their Zero-Covid policy, the world’s factory has become more unpredictable, thus raising prices of those products. Finally, the geopolitical conflict in Eastern Europe is also causing inflation because Russia is a significant global energy player as a hydrocarbon exporting country. With Western Europe weaning itself from Russian hydrocarbons, they engage in bidding wars with other countries in the purchase of oil and gas from alternative sources in Qatar, Algeria, and the United States. This auction-like situation in the global hydrocarbon market contributes to these inflation rates.
National governments can generally act on inflation rates by recalibrating fiscal policies that influence the movements of the market. However, this entails tremendous amounts of political maneuvers, consensus-building, and concessions, which can be both time-consuming and politically unpopular. This can be observed when the British pound slumped when then-UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and her then-Chancellor of the Exchequer announced their mini-budget program, which attempted to cut taxes, in the hopes of spurring economic growth. Such counterproductive measures in their fiscal policy witnessed the careers of these two Members of the Parliament flounder, as UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ended up becoming the newest resident of 10 Downing Street.
Recalling how divisive fiscal policies can be in the realm of politics, the Central Banks’ action of raising interest rates seems to be the easiest path. However, they have another power under their sleeves to prop-up the value of their respective currencies, and it is by selling foreign exchange reserves. In the case of the Bank of Japan, which has been hesitant to raise interest rates, they ended up purchasing JPY from the international market by selling a portion of its foreign exchange reserves. This intervention temporarily increased the value of the JPY vis-à-vis the USD. However, a notable currency that had strengthened is the Russian ruble (RUB). Despite international economic sanctions slapped on Russia that greatly devalued its currency for a few weeks, massive interventions by the Bank of Russia were put in place, which generated demand for the Russian currency. These interventions include limiting capital flight from Moscow, and ensuring that purchasing Russian hydrocarbons would utilize the RUB. Notwithstanding its strong currency, Russia’s economic outlook still looks bleak.
America’s Federal Reserve (Fed) has been pretty aggressive in observing the consumer price index of the United States as Chairman Jerome Powell is seeking to hike interest rates, which will further increase demand for USD in the international market. Until US inflation hovers around 5%, the Fed will most likely continue to increase interest rates, and with the USD’s preponderance in global trade, its reverberations will be felt all across the world. With such, the PHP will continue to weaken against the USD, unless the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will incrementally raise interest rates by a few basis points that would not shock the local Philippine economy.
Beyond these turbulent times, the current standing of the Philippine economy seems to be relatively stable. Unemployment rates seem to be manageable, and inflation rates in the Philippines are lower in comparison to other major countries, albeit a little higher from its target of 2%. The country’s solid foreign exchange reserves also serve as a good cushion, which is currently valued at 8-10 months worth of imports, and is even expected to increase further as international remittances to the Philippines are expected to flood the country come December. Needless to say, the Marcos Jr. administration must adopt a conservative fiscal policy by reducing dependency on issuing government bonds, and by continuously investing in areas that will make the Philippine economy more productive in the near future.
Analyzing these observations from other countries, the young congressman from Ilocos Norte does understand his political economy way more than these professional Filipino charlatans, who are only good at sensationalizing content without the necessary contexts. Indeed, ignorance is bliss.",Others
The Mandate of Pinoy Entertainment Is To Protect Baduy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/the-mandate-of-pinoy-entertainment-is-to-protect-baduy/,"Here we go again, pinoy mediocrity is the problem and the powers that be think the solution is more of the same. Jinggoy Estrada made news suggesting he might pursue a ban of Korean shows. Not to be “outdone” Robin Padilla wants a tariff on imported shows.  Why can’t you two accept the fact that Filipino movies and TV year round cater to the baduy and only the baduy? When foreign entertainment get sponsors and ticket sales did it ever occur to you it is because their content is intellectually more appealing than what is churned out locally? Padilla claims people have lost their jobs in the industry. Job loss tends to happen when companies produce products of inferior quality.
I don’t care how many times I have to say it. Whatever you call entertainment be it TV shows, movies, athletics , food the world pretty much skips the Philippines. Whatever their pain threshold for baduy is easily satisfied by a niche in their local market unlike the Philippines where the whole entertainment pie is comprised by baduy and there is no niche for anything that requires braincells. Estrada believes local talent is world class because his family is considered by this country as talented. Somebody forgot to tell the rest of the world. KSP is the root of all evil and apparently the root of all delusion.
Some people see the glass as half empty , some see the glass as half full. Some people saw the first Olympic Gold Medal in 2021 as a cause of great celebration. I saw it as par for the course considering how many countries have more than single digit gold medals in every single Olympics. Hate to break it you but the Philippines cares less about sports than it even does about quality TV. Where else in this country do you see passion for any sport other than basketball? Basketball is the only sport that can draw some semblance of a crowd. I am not the least bit surprised that the one Olympic gold in the history of this nation happened in a woman’s sport since all the men still believe that basketball is the sole path to athletic pansin.
Just so you and I can be on the same page, let’s agree on a working definition of baduy. Baduy is anything or anybody severely lacking in the following traits: wit, reverence, originality, irony, self awareness, nuance, IQ and dignity. Our local TV industry operates on a 3 word mandate : appeal to baduys. The great Colin Cowherd often says ratings are the truth serum. Show me pinoy ratings gold and I doubt you will show me anything that even MENSA can comprehend.
I am not a Korean entertainment fanboy by any stretch of the imagination but there is merit there. I have seen Song Kang-ho in three movies (Memories of a Murder, Parasite and A Taxi Driver) none of them in English. Toss in Oldboy (2003) , Burning ( 2018) and the Netflix hit Squid Games and I guarantee you nothing there will remind you of pinoy TV.
Strength does not need protection. Quality does not need protection. Inferior goods require protection. The market place is reality. The reality is pinoy entertainment is not sought after anywhere in the world and some politicians are proposing that it needs elimination of superior competitors in order to survive. Too bad those politicians will rarely look at jumpstarting the cerebral prowess of the producers of our local content and / or the audience. Oh yeah, I forgot who the dad of one of those politicians is and his contribution to the intellect of the country.
Ironically I want to close this diatribe by citing a locally made forty year old movie. Peque Gallaga’s Oro, Plata, Mata was set in Negros Occidental during World War II. Throughout the whole movie, the threat was always made out to be the invading Japanese. The danger was out there. In reality the only danger was internal. A bitter, entitled  local who could care less about the collective and who was only in it for himself.",Others
Humanity best give up its search for the Perfect World,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/search-for-perfect-world/,"I recall an address some years back by a Philippine military or police spokesperson to discourage youth from joining the New People’s Army where he advised them to stop dreaming of a perfect world. I find that sound advice that I hope many people will listen to. As I have written, many ideologies and philosophies were thought up since ancient times through the Industrial Age to try and create a “better world” or Utopia. In the end, they create more conflict and lead to more suffering and unnecessarily death, which is well-demonstrated with the case of Marxism.
Activist Charlie Kirk said that the most dangerous person ever is not the tyrant, but the ideologue. These kinds of people believe they know the perfect way by which all humanity must live by. But when the rest of humanity doesn’t agree, they get angry and decide, if you don’t want to join us, perish. To borrow from Hans Morgenthau, ideologues are likely the types who think, “let (my) justice be done, even if the world must perish.” I described their kind as those who want to “save the world” but they actually destroy it. If you think religions are bad, these are worse.
Some people will point out, there are really dumb people, like those who go out during Covid without masks, those who don’t get vaccinated, those who play stupid games to win stupid prizes. These are in the way of our comfort and peace of mind, so ideologies that are for the killing and controlling of these people are justified. Ideologues get mad at the world’s imperfection, they lash out and kill people. But the problems do not disappear. In fact, it only makes the problems of the world bigger.
Way I see it, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx and the Neo-Marxists, and even Jean Jacques Rousseau, thought their “great ideas” can solve the world’s problems. Everyone just needs to follow their awesome ideas to create the perfect world. If you let people run their own lives, they’re bound to mess things up! Nobody’s perfect, as the saying goes, so these “nobodies” need to be controlled by them! But “nobody’s perfect” is itself the reason no one should take complete control of other people, even for supposedly noble purposes.
Then they get so pissed with people not listening to then, in addition how difficult life is. So they thought, the only solution is to bitch about it. Ah heck with it, let’s destroy the world and maybe we’ll wake up one day and find it a Utopia. Things will respawn like in a video game. That’s not how the world works, but the Neo-Marxists and Wokes persist in thinking it does.
As I said in an earlier article, Marxism and similar Utopian ideas appeals to the inner savage, the sinful nature or the nature that makes us think “ah, screw it” and do wrong to others if they contradict. As it is a massive lashing out against reality, Marxism, not religion, is the real “sigh of the oppressed” and “opium of the people,” albeit a misguided and murderous sigh.
I also wrote that one of the reasons for destructive ideologies was misinterpretation of the Bible, namely that part about the Garden of Eden. Eden was thought of as a primitive Utopia where Adam and Eve were irrational savages, giving some ideologues like Rousseau the wrong idea about how a perfect world should be. Other faulty interpretations of this Bible passage include the idea that humanity was supposed to have immortality and be superbeings in the garden, or that Eden was supposed to have free food all the way and no death and pain would exist. And so Rousseau’s and Marx’s means to restore this version of Eden required the murder of millions.
What If
Let’s do a little thought experiment. What if some form of Perfect World actually happens? Let’s say, a world where humans are somewhat immortal and don’t die of disease or other “normal” circumstances. But let’s put in a caveat, such as, they can still be killed. For me, Michael Moorcock’s Dancers at the End of Time novel series provides a good insight into how that will go.
In that story, humans at the end of time have power rings that give them godlike powers. They can fly, resurrect others and travel in time. But they are also so decadent and morally base that they engage in games like depressing another through trickery and, when the victim commits suicide or dies some way, the victimizer will resurrect them to do it again. So they kill each other, resurrect their victim, then repeat. In other words, given Utopian conditions, humans can still abuse and torture each other. I think Moorcock is spot on with his representation of human behavior and it shows why it’s best that humans don’t have superpowers (a point likely also made in the comics The Boys and Marshal Law).
Some will retort, but humans when they gain powers won’t be like Moorcock’s characters. They will change their nature and become naturally selfless and all (what Marx and Engels predicted). I doubt. Reality has shown that while we almost have godly power through some scientific advances, i.e. the power to destroy the world with the atomic bomb or ability to split atoms through a Hadron Collider, human nature remains the same. Advancement in power and technology does not mean advancement in wisdom. This comes from something else, mostly values from religion (updated with post-Enlightenment ideas and recent scholarship) and common sense.
Keeping A Grip on Reality
The world is indeed limited by the laws of reality and it is basically untameable. Perhaps this is the greatest frustration of all. It is difficult to eradicate or even just alleviate world hunger because of the complexities of growing food and hunger being a recurring need. We are subject to disease; I doubt we can eradicate it. We wish we could enjoy sex or do things like plug a fork into an electric socket without consequence, but the consequences are the rule. People have been looking for the fountain of life, trying to be immortal on Earth, which some scientists are likely tinkering with in genetics; but I doubt they’ll crack the code because it may have self-protection against tampering. And so on.
Life isn’t fair, so people seek mystical escapes. Admittedly even in Christian circles, some believe hope for magic powers on this earth. I believe this comes from an aspect of humanity that gives rise to cognitive dissonance (as well as more misinterpretations of Scripture). Humans wish they could better cope with life’s difficulties in a magic way. We wish we could be in two places at once, we wish we could have many arms, we wish we could make things we need magically appear or those we hate magically disappear. Or, we wish we could change other people’s nature and make them serve our needs.
But, sad as it may seem, that will never come true. We can only work within the reality we are in. Life is full of compromises that we have to live with. But this should not make us mad that we lash out against others.
Anti-Entitlement
One of the great lessons in life is that we are entitled to nothing, including the pleasures of life, freedom from all pain, or even the perfect world. But we should not see this as unjust.
Dropping entitlement does not mean giving up hope on making things better. It is accepting that, since we can’t control reality, we should not be vehemently insistent and demanding of what we want, as these tendencies are among the very things that lead humans to hurt others. For example, when you don’t get what you want, like your ideas for a perfect world being implemented by others, you assume that other people are getting in your way and you want to put them away somehow. When it gets to the extreme, you would reach the point where you might want to kill these obstructions.
One of the greatest forms of gaslighting is saying that these “obstructions,” because they are obstructing perfect world ideas that could save people, are murderers. But really, is that connection provable? Isn’t that a slippery slope being applied as an excuse to murder people (and therefore the killers of “obstructions” become the actual murderers)? How can you prove that perfect world ideas will save lives? Is the perfect world really guaranteed by such ideas?
Dropping entitlement will make you not want to kill “obstructions.” It is one of the major milestones in maturity; in my own life, it led me to become less selfish, more understanding and more charitable towards people. One line of the Prayer for Serenity coins the attitude: “accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.”
I daresay that ideologies like Marxism are the product of an entitled attitude. James Lindsay of New Discourses said that Marx often depended on dole-outs by his Communist Manifesto partner Friedrich Engels. When Engels’ wife died, Marx’s consolation letter had only two sentences of actual consolation, while the rest was to the tune of “despite your sadness, keep the checks rolling, buddy.” This is also surmised to be Marx’s frustration with the world, wherein, “these rich guys won’t give me money, so let them all die.” This was expected to lead to the repossession of bourgeosie property, so Marx’s ideas can be seen a modus where he can take others’ property for himself.
Some may say, life can’t be worth living if we live in an imperfect world. This is wrong and is loser mentality. Humanity does have power over their own lives. A key element is understanding that doing good and “fixing things” are not a one time action that will lead to everything being perfect after. It is all continuous action that we must maintain throughout our lifetimes. While we may never have the perfect world, we can still work towards something like it.
Though life is difficult, it should be no reason for us to do wrong to our neighbor. We can help each other not just in the spirit of love of neighbor, but also by the Common Sense that Thomas Paine wrote about. We help each other not because of a social contract or state duties, but because we act upon the common sense to help each other uphold our inalienable rights.
Some people would retort, there are problems with capitalism and classical liberalism too! But the problems are not rooted in capitalism itself. They are rooted in human nature. Ideologies are created from imperfect understanding of humanity and nature. I daresay they are the products of human nature as well. We can’t change other people’s nature, we can only change our own.
Another of the great mistakes of Marxism is the assumption that individual will is the obstruction to a perfect world. Because individual wills often can’t get on the same program, they have to be suppressed or even destroyed. But individual will is a vital component of what makes us human. If individual will is erased and people made into drones, humanity is lost. Marxism and its derivatives are hypocritical; they claim to humanize man more, but they actually dehumanize.
Religion is also important because it helps us cope with our suffering without lashing out irrationally. That’s why Marx hated religion. But not lashing out is still the better decision to make.
The afterlife was probably thought of because Utopia cannot be achieved in the physical world; there is hope of finding it in the other world. Or, if it is to be realized in physical world, only the deity can bring it about. If humans try to bring it about, they will fail. That indeed has happened in history.
Keep “Great Ideas” Capped
When people have a great idea about the world that they feel that they should force everyone else to be on board with them, we should use true critical thinking on them. Are they sure their idea is really great? Will it not result in unintended consequences? Will it infringe on the inalienable rights of people? What will you do if no one likes your idea, will you curse them and think of them as stupid people? If a person thinks that he needs to force others to follow him to make his “great idea” work, you can be more certain that his idea is actually bad.
The belief that humanity can perfect the world is one of the greatest manifestations of its hubris. Humans are capable of thinking up grandiose ideas that involve the whole world, but when they try to put things into action, the law of unintended consequences tends to take over. And yet they don’t back down or reconsider their plan, but try the same thing over and over again hoping it will succeed the next time (Which Marxists and communists keep doing).
Something to think about: when people think of an idea on how to achieve the perfect world, they are actually saying that they themselves are perfect. Because, if you have an idea on creating a perfect world that is supposed to work, the logic is that you yourself are perfect, right? Perfection cannot come from imperfection. So humans who claim that they can create a perfect are equating themselves with God. And when they think of themselves as perfect or God, it often leads to thinking that they have the right over the lives of other people. No mystery as to where that will next lead.
As long as that desire for a perfect world remains, the tendency for violence and the urge to challenge reality will remain. That desire sets us up for failure. So perhaps we should heed that military officer’s advice on acceptance of the impossibility of Utopia. After all, the word Utopia means “no place,” its use by Thomas More signifying that it is impossible to achieve.
I say we should watch out for those people who believe they have the way to make the world perfect. Some praise ideologues as heroes, based on the definition that heroes try to save the world. I disagree. For me, true heroes are the ones who stop those who want to change the world.
My libertarian and “leave people alone” ideas are criticized by others who say, you can’t leave people alone because you have to take control of stupid people. On the contrary, what if stupid people were the ones in control?  Yes, they are capable of taking power. Also, if you really want to avoid stupid people, leaving them alone might itself be the best solution.
There’s this trope where one tells another “you sound like my mom” as a way of saying “don’t interfere in my life” (‘huwag kang makialam’ in Tagalog). This refers to moms, often old-school Filipino moms or parents in general, who I described before as authoritarian. They would try to dictate what you should eat, what music you should listen to, what clothes you should wear, what your opinion should be, etc. They do this of course because they think they know what’s best for their children. The problem with ideologues is that they want to be like this, they want to be your mom. But, as the saying above implies, only your mom can be your mom, and others can’t.
Some may say, I have trust issues if I refuse to listen to idealogues or let the “right leaders” control my life. I’ll turn that around: those who want to control others are the ones with trust issues, because they refuse to trust people to run their own lives, which is the normal.
Giving up the perfect world does not mean giving up on life or goodness. Not trying to reach perfection is not a surrender to evil. The imperfection of physical existence is not evil. It is simply what is. We should just accept our limits and know what we can do within them. Because if we try to defy those limits, we may do more harm than good.",Others
Revisiting my regard for Noynoy Aquino,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/revisiting-my-regard-for-noynoy-aquino/,"To be upfront about it, it was impossible not to feel even a slight tinge of discomfort on news of former president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino’s passing. I started blogging two years into his term, and I gave him hell whenever there was an undesirable event, effect, or outcome related to his government’s goings-on. The thesis of Get Real Philippines, which I still stand by after all these years, focuses on the cultural dysfunction found in Filipino society. Political dysfunction is a result of the cultural one; BS Aquino, at that time, embodied dysfunctional culture to a T. Blogging during his presidency was rather easy to do because he and his administration provided plenty of material to work with.
In light of his death, do I now have remorse/regret for criticizing him back then? The answer is easy, I do not. Based on the circumstances, data, and my critical thinking faculties at that time, I took my positions on issues – which more often than not put me on the opposite side of Aquino’s supporters, the Yellowtards. I do it currently with sitting president Rodrigo Duterte; I would’ve done it regardless of whoever won the 2016 elections.
But I digress.
It would have been simple enough to let people air their memories with the dead. Filipinos, however, true to form, simply cannot restrain themselves from injecting politics into any discussion. It happens on both sides, whether it be the Opposition, where the remaining (closet) Yellowtards want a three-peat of the dead Aquino emo vote catapult, or the pro-Duterte, who will vigorously defend their precarious sandcastle majority with “indecent” language. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter who started the politicization and the mudslinging first; what does is that there has been no change in the speed and extent to which the “debate” devolves into prick-waving and gutter talk.
I looked at my social media timelines, and I saw two separate worlds, chalk and cheese, in commemoration/recall of the past. On one hand, I saw the recall of those who worked with/under him, and they genuinely speak of a man who, in their view, did his best, and was generally one of the nicest guys to hang around with. I had also seen how some of the educated would speak of how proud they were to be Filipino under his time (kay sarap maging Pilipino); one can trace that to the economic growth they perceived during his term (spoiler: it was because of his predecessor Gloria Arroyo), and the deodorized foreign news releases about his administration.
On the other hand, BS Aquino’s critics were there to provide the other perspective. As I already mentioned, the economic growth is due to the sound fundamentals planted in GMA’s term. His government’s response to Typhoon Haiyan was a masterclass in disastrous disaster management. The eight HK tourists who died in that bus and the SAF 44 who died in Mamasapano are most likely waiting for him in the next life, too.
If you haven’t figured it out yet, the more privileged took to Noynoy because of how he made them feel. I don’t think I would be wrong in saying that all that “education” and “privilege” was useless because, being Filipino, they still suspended their “critical evaluation” in the face of Yellowtard rhetoric. But below a certain societal point, it became all about feeling something else – results. People were still poor, hungry, and some were left to fend for themselves. The survivors of those who died due to force majeure/mismanagement were brushed off/treated in a rather cavalier manner. It came to the point that mainstream media, despite PNoy’s incessant complaints about unfavorable coverage, simply couldn’t hide the stink anymore.
Unfortunately, the proponents of these two different perspectives have not sat down and talked about moving forward together. It didn’t happen when Ferdinand Marcos died, it didn’t happen either when both Ninoy and Cory checked out too. The point here is that the predominant way of “teaching history” here in the Philippines is not getting all the differing perspectives to sit down together and make a comprehensive account; rather, it is to propagate only one point of view, in this case the Yellowtard view,shut out others, shove it down everybody else’s throats, and ostracize people for not toeing the line. It would’ve continued to work – but Rodrigo Duterte was elected president in 2016.
While reading through the recollections of how Noynoy was supposedly a nice guy, it brings up memories of a trait that is prevalent among the older Filipinos, even one I witnessed in my own family. In the vernacular, it can be expressed as “mabait sa kaibigan at pamilya, kupal sa iba” (kind to friends and family, a dick to strangers). I’m not saying BS Aquino was a dick, but the differing recollections of how people knew him puts forth an uncomfortable, and debilitating, reality – that perhaps Pinoys will take another long while to extend their kindness and consideration beyond their own clans.
Next, there’s this (supposed to be) simple matter of “respecting the dead.”
You really can’t fault Duterte’s supporters for acting the way they did. A common theme among Duterte’s critics – many of them Yellowtards – is that there’s the “wishing him dead” social media posts. You don’t get a moral high ground to admonish the people on showing the respect for their dead when you disrespect the living.
Let’s put this out there; the only difference between the Aquino and Duterte cults is the personality that each worships. Yet the zealotry, rabidity, and the sensitivity to differing perspectives – you’re looking at two sides of the same coin. Unlucky for the former, however, they’re now the minority because their candidate, Mar Roxas, didn’t win the election; the dominant force and its constituents will push back if you “don’t know your place.”
Supporters of the Aquino family and the Liberal Party have already utilized the sympathy vote for a dead family member twice already. You really can’t fault them for trying a third time. A few friends/colleagues of mine note the impact of social media in influencing the vote – something I had always downplayed. Even without social media, however, I doubt Noynoy could ever match the emotional attachment that propaganda successfully created for his parents. Digital age or not, Pinoy emo transcends the times, but generally Pinoys have a finely honed radar for detecting insincerity. In Noynoy’s case, Filipinos would’ve been very good at discerning “pure and innocent” from an “immature simpleton”.
Lastly, let’s look at the notion that Noynoy Aquino was not corrupt. Whether it be not corrupt, or kind, or uncompromising on quality, or whatever, if the people around you don’t measure up, then your own virtues don’t count for shit. I find this situation common between BS Aquino and Rodrigo Duterte. In Noynoy’s case, he may have been not corrupt and held himself to a high standard, but ultimately he was done in by the fact that his cabinet was riddled with Peter-principles; Duterte unfortunately faces the same fate. Both sides’ supporters want their idol to be cast in history based on how he made them feel, but ultimately it’s the results that matter – and those who write the books.
Let’s close this chapter on Philippine necropolitics, shall we? I really do hope Noynoy gets to rest in peace; unfortunately his death is inevitably going to be used to revive a political entity on life support. The Yellowtards have been all about Laban (they still are), and yet I don’t think anyone could have ever imagined that their revolution required eating up members of the Aquino family. Or maybe they did, especially when they figured out how potent it was.
EDSA is DEAD. Ninoy is DEAD. Cory is DEAD. And now Noynoy is DEAD. If the Yellowtards need to keep on relying on dead bodies to prop their revolution up, then perhaps that collective entity too is already DEAD – still walking aimlessly, but essentially DEAD.
It’s time Filipinos keep dead entities, well…DEAD.",Others
US hasty pullout from Afghanistan left technology and data the Taliban could use to hunt down its enemies,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/us-hasty-pullout-from-afghanistan-left-technology-and-data-the-taliban-could-use-to-hunt-down-its-enemies/,"The US not only abandoned Afghans in general but also exposed those who worked with them to the danger of reprisal and execution by the Taliban government. It did not bother to destroy the database containing sensitive information about Afghan Army regulars and members of the national police, not to mention ordinary citizens whose files also reflected their political sympathies. The Taliban can now hunt these individuals down with ease if they don’t have the means to leave the country or go into hiding which presents the most difficult circumstances for their ordinary existence. An MIT Technology Review report cites the US-funded Afghan Personnel and Pay System (APPS) the database of which holds detailed personal data about hundreds of thousands of Afghan military and police personnel who served under the former US-backed Afghan government recently deposed  by the Taliban.
A presentation on the police recruitment process from NATO’s Combined Security Training Command–Afghanistan shows that just one of the application forms alone collected 36 data points. Our sources say that each profile in APPS holds at least 40 data fields.
These include obvious personal information such as name, date, and place of birth, as well as a unique ID number that connects each profile to a biometric profile kept by the Afghan Ministry of Interior.
But it also contains details on the individuals’ military specialty and career trajectory, as well as sensitive relational data such as the names of their father, uncles, and grandfathers, as well as the names of the two tribal elders per recruit who served as guarantors for their enlistment.
The Taliban has promised that they will abide by Sharia’h Law but their past behavior during the time when they ruled Afghanistan before the US invasion doesn’t offer much optimism for those who are affected by this act of betrayal. The haste with which America withdrew from Afghanistan has wasted what gains they made during their twenty-year occupation. It does not help that the US government condoned the corruption of their puppet Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani but also did not make inroads in curbing the pervasive corruption which was also another reason for ordinary Afghans to sympathize with the Taliban. This is evident in the quick manner with which the Taliban were able to control key regions and cities after the American withdrawal. It took less than fifteen days for the Taliban to be in Kabul.
There was clearly no sincere effort to evacuate Afghans who worked with the Americans. The same is true of the NATO countries that colluded with the Americans in their occupation. The American actions in Afghanistan are reminiscent of its “support” for the Philippines against China during the Scarborough Standoff which was triggered by the belligerent attitude the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino took against China in compliance with American wishes. The Philippines lost sovereign territory that had been under its control even before the Spanish period. The US State Department could not do anything after China reneged on the terms of the State Department brokered compromise. The Philippines spent more than a billion pesos in an arbitral award which was not practicably enforceable. It also did not receive substantial military aid to at least patrol the South China Sea in a manner which constitutes actual deterrence of encroachment.
The US has lost much of its credibility following its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. It stands to reason that the Taiwanese are now also wary of what to expect in the event that China decides to forcibly take back what they consider a renegade province. US President Joe Biden may yet become the Jimmy Carter of his time who wasn’t even selected to run for a second term against his Republican opponent. The Democrats may lose seats in the Senate and the House during the upcoming midterm elections. The implications of the withdrawal continue to be felt and it will haunt Biden throughout his term.",Others
Manny Pacquiao’s cheap talk on government corruption won’t solve it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/manny-pacquiaos-cheap-talk-on-government-corruption-wont-solve-it/,"I waited for Senator Manny”Pac-Man” Pacquiao’s exposé on corruption in various government agencies before writing about what I experienced about corruption in government at the level of a public educational institution. Corrupt government employees are socio-psychopaths. Most of them have a distorted sense of values. They’re engaged in corrupt practices but like to think they’re doing the institution they’re part of a lot of good. It’s about the image they have of themselves in their heads and what they project.
The Vice-President for Administration and Finance in that institution was clearly not qualified for her post. Why? Her undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Arts. Her postgraduate degrees had nothing to do with either administration or finance. But she was very close to a former Mayor with a one syllable surname. She was slated to become the President of the institution but didn’t get the appointment because her political patron lost in the election. Her group was the largest faction in the institution. They had the most rackets going under the supervision of their syndicate members but it was hard to get evidence because she controlled the two divisions where the evidence could be found.
Another form of corruption is the promotion of unqualified individuals by non-adherence to human resource actions under the Civil Service Code. You have a situation where you have full-time faculty members who are inarticulate. An example is a faculty member whose undergraduate degree is Architecture with a Master’s degree in Public Administration teaching Physical Education. Inarticulation is prohibited by both the Civil Service Commission and the Commission on Higher Education.
Then you have the money-making ventures such as the pocketing of tuition and other fees for off-campus programs under the graduate school. The “package” includes a ready-made thesis with a passing grade. These are offered to government employees who have to continue with their education in order to qualify for the next higher plantilla position. It used to be that there would be no increase in pay without a promotion but the salary standardization law corrected this error with annual step increases based on the formula provided for.
In a local city university where everything is supposed to be provided for free, students are asked to pay for ID cards, Physical Education (PE) and National Service Training Program (NSTP) uniforms, the purchase of textbooks written by faculty members themselves, food and drink from a canteen concessionaire whose patrons hold office at City Hall. There is also the improper disbursement of grants from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and other non-goverment organisations (NGOs) or aid organizations.
Most employees aren’t qualified for their jobs either. Those who don’t have civil service eligibility are lumped into Administrative Aide I and II positions. Their income is augmented by having them take post-graduate studies in the same institution where they are sure to pass. Upon “completion” of their studies, they then become part-time instructors in minor subjects such as NSTP. Their teaching loads augment the low pay from their plantilla positions. The employees who try to expose these corrupt practices usually become pariahs. They are the object of white paper exposés sent to the gods at City Hall. Each college’s Dean and his faculty members also have rackets going on specially in Health Sciences, Engineering and Criminology.
If you’re wondering why public education is in such a sorry state, this is why. But the rot doesn’t end there. The rot has reached private educational institutions as well. This is why our students have fallen behind Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings. Just the other day, it was a World Bank study which called attention to the deteriorating situation in the education sector. Even if you have the evidence, filing the case and seeing it through at the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan is a tedious process. Just look at the cases filed by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) against the Marcos cronies as an example.
In short, it’s easy to say that there is corruption in government but it is hard to prove. While I don’t begrudge the effort of Pac-Man, it’s clear that his is not a sincere effort but more of catching the public’s attention for his political plans. Minimizing corruption in government needs a radical solution. Digitization is the solution but given the size of the bureaucracy and our political structure, it’s hard to implement it. It is easier to replace the bureaucracy wholesale than pursue cases against the guilty. This is why we should not be fooled by motherhood statements coming from candidates for 2022. They need to have a specific plan of action. Otherwise, talk is cheap and evidence is not easy to collect.",Others
Urgent Help Needed: Transitioning Pre-Pandemic Kids to F2F Classes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/urgent-help-needed-transitioning-pre-pandemic-kids-to-f2f-classes/,"I wish my youngest incoming Grade I kid would’ve shared the same enthusiasm that a first day F2F (face to face) class could bring, but unfortunately it wasn’t the case.
The pandemic struck perfectly when he should’ve been in school trying to learn to socialize. That was the other edge of the sword that some of us had to deal with. Of course for fairness sake I have to admit that being “forced” to stay at home and becoming a more hands-on dad for more than a couple of years rocked more than it sucked.
But it hits differently for the little fella: he went around his room fluently reading all the visuals that he can read while his classmates were attentively writing their names on a piece of paper as instructed by their teacher. Not understanding the importance of staying still on his seat and writing his name as instructed, he became “unruly”. My educator wife could’ve argued to her heart’s content (she knows perfectly well what her and our kids’ rights are) when it comes to the “should’ves” of our kid who needs to adjust to the F2F setup. But we opted to talk to a private school instead.
I felt pity for the little boy. Some tears fell, and God knows how painful those tears were for me as a parent.
Obviously, we had a pandemic to blame for the lost opportunity to teach the kid the basics of having classmates and authority figures in school. But because we’re trying hard to be rational, we also understand the importance of F2F and neither of us are against the implementation of which. We recognize however that this is a learning opportunity for school and parents alike to improve the kids’ F2F experience:
– right at the start of the F2F classes, which will lead to the second part of my argument.
Instead of the teacher giving my wife blank looks that say “it’s not just on you, it’s on us also but we cannot do anything at the moment so we’re very sorry. Go find help elsewhere…” It is obvious that there is either absence of set procedures that will supposedly address the said transition issue at hand, or if there are set rules from the top, it is not being properly implemented on the ground.
It’s fortunate that we can find help where we need them and when we need them. But just thinking how hopeless it is for other parents because of the kind of response of the teachers that we encountered, I can’t help but feel pity towards mine and other’s kids, and a bit of resentment to school authorities who obviously could’ve done better.",Others
Duterte’s unfinished business and the clear plan for 2022 to 2028 that the Opposition LACKS,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/dutertes-unfinished-business-and-the-clear-plan-for-2022-to-2028-that-the-opposition-lacks/,"One of the items on Rodrigo Duterte’s platform of government in 2016 was federalism. This has remained unfulfilled largely due to the Senate being the stumbling block to constitutional amendments. The 1987 Constitution doesn’t state explicitly of both houses of Congress voting as one or both, with a 3/4 majority is required to deem an amendment is passed and submitted to the people for ratification in a referendum. This may be one of the reasons why Duterte has opted to run for Vice-President in 2022. This is his unfinished business.
The PDP-Laban Senate slate is composed entirely of candidates that Duterte can expect to support his move to change the country’s system of government. It’s also a referendum on his performance as President. If he receives a new mandate as Vice-President, this confirms he has the people’s support to move forward with his unfinished business. Duterte would need at least 18 votes to pass an amendment abolishing the Senate and transitioning to a unicameral parliamentary system. Most of the candidates who have declared their bid for the Presidency haven’t disclosed their platforms yet. Not much can be expected from Isko Moreno and Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao. Isko is definitely the candidate of anti-Duterte oligarchs. He will not move to change the form of government. In the case of Pacquiao, the same is true because Koko Pimentel has his hand up Manny’s ass.
Moreno, Pacquiao and Robredo are best described as sock puppet candidates. The priority concern of Filipinos is moving forward in the present environment. Corruption cannot be minimized under the present bureaucracy. It will have to be a reset and the best way to do that is to devolve it. The same is true with digitization. It cannot be implemented wholesale specially with departments and agencies which are national in scope. The pandemic has exposed the country’s lopsided economic development where 40% of economic activity is in NCR+. As an archipelago, there is no limitation to regional development given airports and seaports have been improved nationwide. Infrastructure is much improved but the work is not done yet. This is why the priority is still infrastructure. It is the better investment than the social amelioration that the Yellows and Reds have been pushing for.
A welfare state breeds indolence and mediocrity. What better way for the oligarchs to control the people if not in this manner. This is why there is no basis in Isko’s and Pac-Man’s claims that they best know the needs of the poor just because they were poor once. Isko’s social amelioration programs in Manila only serves the interests of the powers that be at City Hall. It is not real economic development because there is no job creation. As far as Pac-Man is concerned, he has no experience whatsoever when it comes to policy formulation. You can’t expect Pimentel to teach Pac-Man or for the latter to understand what it will take to lift the poor out of poverty.
In the grand scheme of things, a Marcos-Duterte ticket, a Senate majority of 3/4 of the vote and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) as Speaker of the House is the ideal scenario for charter change moving forward. This is why next week will determine what the issues will be for the May election. This is why the country is at a crossroads and this is why we should vote on the basis of issues and not popularity or personalities.",Others

A Few Facts About the Arbitration Against China.
Florin T. Hilbay
I read with amusement and disappointment retired Justice Antonio Carpio’s 1 July 2021 piece in the Inquirer. Let me take this opportunity to point out falsehoods and inaccuracies in his story, and tell the nation a few facts about this interesting case.
During my time as Solicitor General of the Republic, I served as “agent” in the arbitration between the Philippines and China. An agent is the sole and formal representative of the State, with full authority to speak for and bind the nation. I was appointed by authority of President Noynoy Aquino. I’m pointing this out from the get-go not to brag about my role but to establish my “skin in the game” — I was the legally accountable officer and my actions as agent were the official acts of government. What is narrated here takes from this background.
On the other hand, Justice Carpio’s formal designation was, as he correctly pointed out, that of an “observer”- he had no direct and formal relationship with Pres. Aquino; was not officially part of the legal team that handled the case; and did not have any authority to speak for or bind the Republic during the arbitration. While his expertise on the matter is a given, as an observer, he had no skin in the game. And yet, he has somehow positioned himself as the voice on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) case, with authority to make accusations and insinuations ex cathedra.
First. When I assumed the position of Solgen, the WPS arbitration was a mess, given what was done to the former agent. J. Carpio had accused then Solgen and agent Francis Jardeleza of betraying the nation because of his actions related to the WPS. Consequently, J. Carpio opposed Jardeleza’s nomination to the Supreme Court (SC). He made the accusations notwithstanding that he only had second-hand information-he was never part of the team that discussed the WPS case at the palace and shouldn’t even have had access to confidential memos used as basis for the charges.
Despite the accusations, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) voted to recommend Jardeleza to the SC. One of those who voted for Jardeleza was then Sec. of Justice Leila de Lima, a member of the President’s legal team with personal knowledge of facts. When the objection was raised before the SC, J. Carpio’s own colleagues rejected his allegations and also voted for Jardeleza. Finally, Pres. Aquino himself appointed Jardeleza to the SC, with full knowledge of the then public allegations of J. Carpio. This history of embarrassing rejections should have merited the deepest of apologies to J. Jardeleza, a batchmate at UPLaw.
That the JBC, SC, and the President rebuffed these grave allegations should also have warranted, under fair conditions, an investigation of the thrice-rebuked accuser. It is worth reiterating here that the allegations were made by an outsider to the case even as the insiders themselves the authoritative decisionmakers, from Pres. Aquino down to his cabinet members -saw no problem with the actions of the country’s agent, J. Jardeleza.
Second. Prior to all this ruckus, I was informed by one of my legal assistants who used to work for J. Carpio that research was being done on how to legally justify the appointment of a sitting member of the SC as agent in the WPS arbitration. At the time, I didn’t even know: (1) what an agent meant-it was the first time I had heard of the term in the context of an arbitration, a field unfamiliar to me; (2) that then Solgen Jardeleza was in fact already the agent in the case.
Suffering from this ignorance, I even told this assistant that the model for that plan was the case of Justice Robert Jackson of the United States SC, who acted as prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials. It was only later on-to my horror-that I realized what all these prior events may have meant. In fairness to J. Carpio, I do not know if he knew what his staff was allegedly researching on, but if he did, then it placed him in a serious moral hazard when he made his accusations against J. Jardeleza.
Third. Given this politicized atmosphere, I sought to avoid being appointed as agent in the case. I already had a lot on my plate, and had no intention of butting heads with giants in the palace or any interloper for that matter. I was young, poor, unknown, did not belong to any organization, and had no powerful patrons. I also initially worried about my lack of rapport with the President’s trusted lawyers-ES Ochoa and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel (now Justice) Ben Caguioa. While they weren’t opposed to my appointment as Solgen, my understanding is that they supported their classmate, then Usec. (now Sec. of Justice) Meynard Guevara, a very kind and competent lawyer. What amounted to an ally in the cabinet at the time was Sec. Butch Abad (who belonged to a different faction) simply because the OSG handled the budget cases that were so controversial at the time. I thus held a powerful office, but had no political base myself. This was fine by me-I saw it as my claim to independence-though it also meant I was vulnerable.
To be sure, I certainly wanted to avoid having to go through the hell that J. Jardeleza just underwent. The publicity (and the eyebrow-raising campaign) generated by the charges leveled by J. Carpio clearly indicated that the WPS case was not just about the country’s case against China, but was also a power play among factions and interests. I didn’t want to be in the eye of that storm; it was a big wave I didn’t want to ride. I could only laugh seeing myself as a Frodo Baggins, minus the fellowship. I therefore made the formal request to ES Ochoa to have someone else handle the WPS case. That request, though initially accepted, was ultimately rejected. I became the agent.
Fourth. I had a challenging relationship Mr. Paul Reichler, the American external counsel hired by J. Jardeleza. Reichler is justifiably a legend, his competence in his field and showmanship in court quite unparalleled. While we agreed for the most part, we had an awkward relationship and at times argued quite intensely.
The core problem was his insistence on proposing joint development between the Philippines and China as a compromise in case we lose the so-called Itu Aba issue. In fairness to Reichler, he was consistent from the day we met until the hearing on the merits in trying to convince me to sign on to a strategy that would justify joint development. I rejected all these proposals for a compromise. (I’ve written about these events in a now public memo to ES Ochoa and J. Caguioa. I’ve also written about it in an article with the Ateneo Law Journal), Truth is, the Itu Aba issue was simply a proxy for the debate over joint development. I was against joint development because it is impermissible as a matter of constitutional law (my area of expertise). With specific reference to China, we simply can’t enter into an economic compromise with a country that doesn’t respect our full sovereign rights.
The other issue were the professional fees incurred by gov’t. This was a serious matter because public funds were being used and the ones accountable were the signatories — myself, ES Ochoa, and Sec. Abad. Politically as well, the palace worried some people were being made to believe their views were important when in all likelihood, the only reason they were being considered was because the gov’t was being billed for them. I politely declined the mild suggestion to consider terminating services of external counsel, as it would have created a greater mess instead of a happy solution.
Fifth. Given Reichler’s views on joint development, I put myself on the lookout for anyone in the team supportive of that project. At the time, the only one in mind was Sec. of Foreign Affairs Albert del Rosario. This was because, in an earlier conversation with Senator Trillanes, he informed me that he believed Sec. Del Rosario was for joint development. Secondly, I immediately noticed Consul General Henry Bensurto (a knowledgeable, but wildly unpopular trusted assistant to Sec. Del Rosario on WPS matters) was in full agreement with Reichler on joint development.
In hindsight, I should have just immediately asked Sec. del Rosario his views on joint development. Sec. Albert is a great diplomat and an adorable, credible, and charming grandfather with a business background. I can understand why, from a diplomat’s and a businessman’s standpoint, a joint development to explore oil and gas in the Reed Bank might be a sound political option. But I simply held a different view and, as agent, had full authority to follow my own heart and mind. The call was mine to make and I refused to be labeled, in J. Jardeleza’s term, “a joint developer.” Strategically as well, I also thought that we should fully commit to winning the arbitration in its entirely and avoid unnecessarily injecting political and economic considerations which might undermine our cause and signal to the arbitrators a potential weakness.
I flagged this concern over joint development with all the insiders-Pres. Aquino, the legal team at the palace, my own team at the OSG, two of Sec. del Rosario’s assistants in the WPS case (the late Amb. Nitoy Valeriano and Amb. Ed de Vega). Seeking a media-savvy ally, I also informed an outsider, J. Carpio, but he dismissed my concerns. From that point on, I suspected he was also in favor of a deal with China.
Sixth. The situation came to a head during the hearing on the merits, where joint development became the sore point of conflict. Prior to the hearing and before leaving for The Hague, I got a call from Reichler where he proposed, yet again, that we signal our openness to joint development. Again, I said no.
At The Hague, I was given copies of the draft speeches of the various speakers for the Philippine team. One draft, that of Prof. Bernie Oxman, included Reichler’s offer of a compromise by way of joint development. I objected to the language, which brought us to the meeting J. Carpio refers to in his Inquirer piece. Entering that meeting, I knew I was in for a debate with Reichler and that he would probably be supported by Sec. del Rosario. To my surprise, that meeting included the observer, J. Carpio. I thought it was inapproriate that an outsider would be included, but did not openly complain. I maintained my opposition to the present language of the draft which included a proposal for joint development and insisted that counsel fully commit to the wave and ride out the full force of our arguments. In frustration, I emphatically declared that “I will not be the Solgen that sold this case to China!” That seemed to have sobered the other side.
J. Carpio states erroneously that I was instructing Reichler and company to flat-out refuse to answer any questions posed by the tribunal. In fact, all I wanted Reichler to do was answer consistent with my views against joint development. It was my right, as agent, to reject an offer of compromise I found unacceptable. I never even bothered to respond to J. Carpio — to agree or disagree with him — simply because he had no authority to attend that meeting in the first place. The meeting was adjourned and we decided to meet again.
In the next meeting. I decided to bring additional witnesses, Sec. Ronald Llamas (a close friend of the President) and former Senator Rodolfo Biazon (a great soldier and statesman). My additional purpose in bringing Sec. Llamas was this-in the event Reichler insisted again on including joint development, I would instruct Sec. Llamas to directly contact the President to inform him that the external counsel was resisting my instructions and undermining the case. That meeting, surprisingly, proceeded without fuss and ended abruptly. Sec. Llamas jokingly asserted the foreign lawyers were intimidated by my two bodyguards. In the end, I got what I wanted: the reference to joint development was deleted and the speech delivered by Prof. Oxman was brilliant. I emailed to thank and congratulate the esteemed academic.
Seventh. J. Carpio complains about an attempt to somehow exclude him as an “observer” during the hearings on jurisdiction at The Hague. Here’s the inside story.
The truth is, save for Sec. Albert and myself, almost no one among the proposed attendees wanted to attend the hearings if J. Carpio and J. Jardeleza were present, given the history between these gentlemen. I was told people were worried of a public altercation between the two old men. But Reichler requested a sizable contingent of VIPs to show the tribunal our seriousness and I agreed it was a good idea. The hearings drew nearer and we still couldn’t send our list of attendees to The Hague.
In desperation, I told ES Ochoa and J. Caguioa that to finally solve the matter I would pay J. Carpio a visit at the SC. Once there, I told him our awkward situation and asked for his assurance that he would behave during the hearings on the promise that I would seek the same guaranty from J. Jardeleza. He graciously agreed. At The Hague, we were able bring a good crowd of VIPs, for which the administration was criticized for promoting a junket. With help from Philippine ambassador to The Hague Jet Ledda, J. Carpio and J. Jardeleza were “socially distanced” from each other the entire time. These were some of the things I had to deal with as agent.
J. Carpio believes there were two single-minded factions within the Philippine team during this arbitration. This is the view of an outsider, which naturally misses out on the nuanced interplay among the actual players in the game. The reality is that the players were independent republics of various sizes, with interests and goals of their own. Some of them had actual skin in the game.
Eight. Given all these, I hope people understand when I say that when the decision came out in 12 July 2016, I felt a sense of relief more than happiness. Prior to promulgation, I felt guns of blame were aimed at me the moment any sign of defeat was written into the decision. But even this relief was tempered by the fact that I had little hope that the incoming administration would pursue the stance taken by Pres. Aquino.
With this in mind, I later on wrote in an op-ed with the Inquirer my position on joint development with China, stating that such proposed agreement is a “Trojan Horse in the West Philippine Sea” because such economic agreement would not only be unconstitutional but worse, lead to a potential waiver of our victory in the WPS.
Ninth. I was not surprised when the Duterte administration announced that it was entering into a “Memorandum of Understanding” with China with respect to joint oil and gas exploration in the WPS. This is the foundational agreement that leads to a joint development with China. In interviews, I pointed out that the model for this “MOU” incorporates the views of China on joint development in its dealings with former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a known ally of China. Any deal that flows from that MOU is therefore deeply problematic.
It also didn’t surprise me that both J. Carpio and Sec. del Rosario, in separate statements, have come out openly and repeatedly to fully endorse this compromise agreement with China. Their favorable views on this deal with China are publicly accessible. In all honesty, I find it unfortunate that J.Carpio, from defending the WPS, now happily descends to join this administration and China by lending his credibility to provide legal cover to this rotten deal. He even personally assures us that this compromise with China is “safe.” Does he really believe that China would be stupid enough to impliedly recognize our victory at The Hague by contract, even as everything that they’ve wanted, they’ve been able to get from President Duterte?
Tenth. In the final analysis, the one person who had the most skin in the game was Pres. Aquino. The decision to fight China and place the nation’s stock on the line was his and his alone. Regardless of what the lawyers, diplomats, economists, and generals may have told Pres. Aquino, this most difficult decision of his term was purely political, borne of courage of spirit and moral strength, not knowledge of any discipline. In my view, 99.99% of the credit over our victory in the WPS rightfully belongs to him. Without his courage to fight, there would have been no case to begin with. I also suggest to anyone and everyone who claims or believes that they have a rightful share in the balance of that credit-all.01% of it-to just burn it and throw away its ashes in honor of a great former president.

If Retired Justice Antonio Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario had been for joint development of oil and gas resources with China all along, what was the reason for the Philippines spending P1 billion on the case? Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) had signed a joint-exploration agreement with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) back in 2004. A seismic survey had been conducted. Could it be that the case was filed only at the instigation of the US to give it cover in its continuing conduct of freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS) in the South China Sea? Was it a PR job to massage the passage of EDCA? Was it meant to finesse the implementation of then President Barack Obama’s pivot to Asia strategy? Or was it all of the mentioned in support of Uncle Sam’s initiatives with PNoy’s explicit blessing for continuing US support of his belligerent stand against China? Only Carpio and Del Rosario can and should enlighten the Filipino people whom they have been agitating to act against the pro-China stand of the President.
Malampaya’s reserves are projected to run out by 2024. Our power generation industry is firmly in the hands of oligarchs. More expensive renewable energy is being rammed down our throats and we’re already paying a feed-in tariff in our monthly Meralco bill. Nuclear is cheaper and cleaner but no one has been paying heed to its number one advocate former Congressman Mark Cojuangco. The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant has been idle since its completion and an annual budget is still set aside for its maintenance. Isn’t it about time that the government acted resolutely as to what is going to be done about it?
We have the second highest power cost in the region which continues to deter foreign direct investment. We need FDIs if the economy is to recover from the pandemic-induced recession.",Others
The insanity that is the Philippine Presidential System—Why “voting wisely” never works,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-insanity-that-is-the-philippine-presidential-system-why-voting-wisely-never-works/,"The Presidential system, in the case of the Philippines, is a hit-or-miss phenomenon. You get a random Joe to run for the highest office in the land in a once-in-a-lifetime chance and hold said office for 6 years. If he’s bad, at least he’ll get to ruin the country for only 6 years. If he’s good, then you’ll be stuck there wishing he can run again for office and bless the country with his magic.The term limit imposed by the 1987 Constitution may have had the noble intention of preventing any would-be dictator from gaining unadulterated and unencumbered power. This is a reactionary provision inserted by the framers to prevent another Ferdinand Marcos from ever happening again. But as with any knee-jerk reaction, this proved to be more of a band-aid solution which now faces its obsolescence.How? For instance, the term limits imposed to positions under the Executive Branch perpetuated the now maligned “political dynasties.” The mentality behind which is that while the parent may no longer run for a position, then perhaps the scion will be as good as the parent.Term limits hinder the development of the nation as it renders continuity of policies a near impossibility. Every 6 years, we get a new president and every 6 years, the Philippines undergoes a coin toss when the new president decides to either continue his predecessor’s efforts in tandem with his own, or scrap the previous administration’s developments altogether and forge new policies—all for the sake of one’s ego and legacy. The same goes for the lower positions.Our system of checks and balances is self-defeating. While the idea behind it is undoubtedly good, the implementation is Kafkaesque. Too much is buried under layers upon layers of unnecessarily complex bureaucracy that by the time things are seemingly resolved, it’s election season again.Take the impeachment process. It’s a burden since it undergoes so much bureaucratic process, drama, and fanfare that weathering the president, no matter how bad he is, is deemed as the more “productive” approach. A non-functioning public servant should be easily dealt with.The Constitution provides immunity from suit to the president such that he may enjoy unencumbered productivity. Again, this is self-defeating. You need not grant immunity to the president if, in the first place, he can be replaced easily.This is where a Parliamentary setup one-ups the Presidential. Once the Prime Minister is deemed a liability to the interests of his party, his party members themselves are, if not forced, inclined to issue a “vote of no confidence” to replace the PM with a better one.See here’s the thing, some would argue that a Parliamentary setup will only encourage the “Padrino” system even more, and they are right. But not in a negative way. The parliamentary system forces parties to shape up lest they risk losing all of their positions come the general elections.The padrino system here is thereby put to good use such that the PARTY itself, not INDVIDUALS, will collude with each other to perform well so as not to lose the public’s faith. Effectively, they are forced to self-audit so they will not lose their House seat.Political personalities will be less common as “personality” is thrust upon each party and the ideas they represent, not merely on individuals that the masses will then worship like a Messianic figure. People should learn to look at ideas, not persons.The presidential system thrusts so much responsibility and power upon one person, and this leads to fanaticism. This gives off the impression that the president is a panacea to all our political ails when in truth, it takes multitude of warm bodies to run a State effectively.Despite the so-called system of checks and balances, it is ironic that erring presidents (or even lower public officials) are rarely held accountable. This is a manifestation of a dysfunctional system. It comes as no surprise since we merely copied it from the USA—a nation with an altogether different culture, geography, peoples, and history seen as alien especially since that the Philippines is an Asian nation.Indeed, systems shape our behavior. While we can argue that we need to put “good” people into position, that itself is a recipe for failure. Any government system that hinges its success upon the benevolence of its operators is doomed to fail.Too often, even “good” people turn bad if they’re stuck with a bad system. This has been the prevailing hijinks every election season: Put someone “good” then that someone ultimately becomes bad. Then if they were indeed deemed to be bad by the court of public opinion, cries for impeachment will be heard all over again. It’s a practice in insanity. It needs to change.It is not good enough that we put “good” people into position. There must also be a system in place that effectively forces them to BE good. Immunity from suit will not guarantee that, nor the costly drama of impeachment when a quick “vote of no confidence” will suffice.It is high time Filipinos stop thinking of politics as a moral battleground where there is an everlasting clash between the light and the darkness. Filipinos must instead look at politics as an industrial machine whose operators also look for competitive wages (read: self-interests) so they can make a living.It is high time Filipinos discard the ideal notion of altogether ridding politics of corruption. It is never going to happen. Politics provides power to those who know how to play and—cliché as it may be—power corrupts. It is up to the people to decide how they can make their politicos’ respective self-interests align with their own.Lastly, Filipinos must learn to think outside of their box and consider that maybe, just maybe, it is not the people in charge who are entirely at fault for the country’s problems but the very system of governance these people operate in.As it stands, people will always be a problem no matter what. They’re just people, after all. Corruption is part of human nature. Cynical as it sounds, it’s just how it is.The best we can hope for is to curb corruption by implementing a system that will effectively and efficiently eject or correct politicians who are performing subpar. The 1987 Constitution certainly does not allow that, nor does our current setup.The proof? History attests to it.",Others
2022 election campaign exposes severe lack of leadership and public administration talent in Philippine politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/2022-election-campaign-exposes-severe-lack-of-leadership-and-public-administration-talent-in-philippine-politics/,"A stoic friend commented about the incestuous nature of Philippine politics. On one hand we have septuagenarians running for the two top posts who are competent and qualified. On the other, we have forty-somethings who are not. What does this say about our politics and leadership development in political institutions? We’re not at par with Singapore which grooms members of parliament for higher posts. A parliamentary system enables a member to learn the rudiments of legislation in preparation to becoming a member of the bureaucracy which allows him to gain experience in how the system works. Singapore members of parliament (MPs) are encouraged to pursue continuing education. As such, they usually have anywhere between one to three post-graduate degrees tucked under their belt by the time they are appointed to head ministries. This is a far cry from what we have here. We have bureaucrats who have post-graduate degrees but no experience in the private sector which works to their detriment since their mindset is still the usual lack of sense of urgency and more bureaucracy.
A case in point is a state college that has been without a President for more than a year just because of the delays in the search committee convened by the Board of Trustees in getting their work done. Going into the last phase of the process will take them another thirty days. Whoever is selected, the next President will have to work with the existing budget and will need to wait eight months again for the next budget season to submit to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It’s only in his second year that he can actually implement his development goals and he’s given only two four-year terms. Reappointment is rightly based on his performance but he does have a particular disadvantage given the time it takes for his required budget to be approved and it is also certain that he won’t receive the full request.
Former President Ferdinand Marcos was conscious of this fact which is why he placed the onus of leadership development on Onofre Corpuz who promptly set-up the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) as the training ground for bureaucrats and future leaders of the country. Sadly the DAP has fallen by the wayside as its own bureaucracy has been riddled with political appointments. The present political structure doesn’t allow new leaders to come up the ladder. Political dynasties have thrived post-Marcos despite the promise of Cory Aquino to do away with them. The ban is stipulated in the 1987 Constitution but there is no enabling law which has been passed by Congress for obvious reasons.
Even the party-list system which is supposed to be an avenue for marginalized sectors to gain representation has been abused by leftist-militant groups and mainstream political dynasties. The House of Representatives has been reduced to a cornucopia of party-list groups which resemble sari-sari stores. There is no control mechanism and corruption at the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has enabled these party-list groups to win seats by reaching the minimum vote threshold set by law. It’s about time that the political structure is reformed to take into account these exigencies. At present the shallowness of the political talent pool is being felt as we have recycled Senators and Congressmen. What’s worse is dynasties rule at the local level specially in the regions. This is why there is minuscule development at that level.
It’s about time that we take stock of what’s needed to become competitive in attracting foreign direct investment. The pandemic has shown the weak underbelly of the economy in terms of economic activities being concentrated in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). This has to change along with the leadership development program if the country is to become truly progressive and development goals achieved.",Others
Iron fists and visionary leadership will continue to sell well in Philippine elections,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/iron-fists-and-visionary-leadership-will-continue-to-sell-well-in-philippine-elections/,"Gone are the days when voters lapped up motherhood statements and ayuda or suntok sa buwan promises to sooth their longing for a respite from the painful reality of living in the Philippines. The landslide victory of Duterte in 2016 was a resounding stamp of approval by the general populace for a change from the way liberal freedom-addicted politicians have been managing the country.
Filipinos now want a strong-handed enforcer to straighten up the system and bring people in line. We saw how lame-duck presidencies led the country down the road of chaos and suffering: like the mess that ensued during Cory’s coup d’etat riddled stint in Malacanang coupled with our literally entering the dark ages (those debilitating power outages), and the shame that came with PNoy taking on the title of worst president the Philippines ever had (with his long infamous list of goof-ups starting from the Luneta hostage crisis down to the SAF44 massacre).
Majority of Filipinos want the same Duterte-type brand of rule in the country this coming 2022, no matter how much the West and the Nobel Peace Prize committee want to portray any tinge of authoritarianism in the country as “evil”. The fathers of past generations have led their families as “authoritarians”. What they said became the rule of law, and that ensured order, stability, unity, and progress in the home.
In fact most functional institutions and organizations are dictatorial by nature. Take a basketball team for example: you cannot question the coach if he decided to use a certain play as a last-2-minute strategy. In a given company like Toyota or Sony, workers are not asked if they prefer Marketing VP Mr. Nakamura to take the reins of the company instead Design Chief Mr. Marumi.
Now let’s take a look at the iron-fisted contenders for this coming 2022 presidential elections:
But beyond the iron fists and strong leadership qualities that each can bring, the additional quality that Duterte brought to the table was his visionary leadership: he sold Filipinos his dream of the country’s youth free from drugs and a new political system based on Federalism. We should elect our next leader not just for being tough and strong but also for his forward-looking agenda. Ask yourself if who you plan to vote for has a plan. Does he have a destination for the country? Does he have a clear strategy for getting us from point A to B?
We are a unique democracy because everyone wants a hand in choosing the best authoritarian-leaning leader who can get us to our destination, and in the most efficient way. Many Filipinos believe a tinge of strict autocratic rule is good for the nation’s soul. Many think that what will work best for us now as a laggard in Asia is a benevolent dictator – someone who calls the shot like a big boss, rather than a weakling pulled by the strings of a puppeteer.
Let us believe in our vision for a Singapore-class C.O.D. (clean, orderly, disciplined) Philippines. Our experiment with too much freedom has left us in the dust amidst our high-flying East Asian neighbors. Let’s choose the man who has the best plan and has the strongest pollical will for getting us there. But if you don’t have a clear concept of our country’s 10-year or 50-year goals, how can we identify the man who best fits the bill in leading us? If we just want an “anything goes” country, then it won’t really matter who leads us as long as we are entertained. As the saying by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) goes…
If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.",Others
"Check out Leni Robredo’s COVID-19 strategy; without the cinematic drama, OA music, and that constipated look on her face",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/check-out-leni-robredos-covid-19-strategy-without-the-cinematic-drama-oa-music-and-that-constipated-look-on-her-face/,"Has Leni Robredo actually taken a stand on anything controversial? It seems that the only thing she’s taken a stand on is, get this, the COVID-19 pandemic. And why not, right? What human on the face of this planet is not concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic? For two years, we were all subject to it and the measures our government’s implemented on a trial-and-error basis to contain it and mitigate its social and economic impacts.
So what does a party and its desperate presidential bet Leni Robredo do when pressed to come up with a platform and strategic vision for the country? Why, come up with a “COVID Strategy” of course!
But of course. It makes perfect sense. As the next president of the country, you just have to have a COVID Strategy, right? And as to what this strategy aims to achieve? Here is a transcript of what Robredo, the foremost expert on combating a global pandemic, proposes — but this time without the OA soundtrack, the poverty porn backdrop, and the constipated look on her face. Ang dapat gawin…
Freedom from worry over getting sick
Public health first
Itigil ang kurapsyon (Stop corruption!)
Itigil ang anumalya (Stop anomalies!)
Competent COVID response leadership
Support for frontliners
Good pay for frontliners
Support for hospitals
– So that when you get sick, you don’t need to worry.
Free and accessible health care
Free consultation using technology
Each Barangay fully equipped and has its own nurse
Give them all that they need to do their job
Fix PhilHealth
Fast claims processing
Vaccines for all
Government to make it easy to deliver vaccines
Freedom from hunger
Filipinos are worried about where to get food for their children
Whenever there is a lockdown, provide immediate ayuda.
Stop large scale lockdowns
Lockdowns should be “targeted”
Support small businesses
Provide financial support to small businesses so they don’t need to layoff workers
Implement unemployment insurance so that people who lose jobs get help from the government
Strengthen agriculture and fishing sectors
Provide enough support to strengthen the livelihoods of fishermen and farmers
Ensure that every Filipino has food
Freedom from lack of education
For low risk areas, start opening schools
For high risk areas, give gadgets and “load” to each student
Increase the number of community learning hubs
Provide Internet access for education purposes

Clearly, with all the dramatics stripped off, all one is really left with is the above transcript of her salient points — basically all motherhood statements that make one think, arent’t we all glad Leni Robredo is here to tell us these things. Considering that Robredo enjoys the benefit of two years of being a miron (observer) to the world’s leaders dealing with what, during their times at the top, had been all unprecedented, the above is all she, her top “thought leaders”, and expensive campaign strategists could come up with.
Stepping back even further one ought to ask this aspiring president: is it really just all about COVID? Looking at the pained look on her face in the video, it becomes evident that this is about everything the energy she would bring to her proposed presidency can cope with. What Filipinos will be subject to once again, if Robredo had her way, will be a government obssessed with “the poor”. Never mind that the future of the Philippines hangs on the quiet achievement of its most promising citizens — the ones who possess the skills, capital, and motivation to invent that longer-lasting lightbulb and develop processes that yield more for less input. It does not lie in people who are burdens to society, are public funds sinkholes, don’t pay income tax, and feel entitled to help from the “more fortunate”.
The fact is COVID is just another one of those things people will have to live with. It can’t be an emergency forever — and certainly not one of those “emergencies” that an administration bereft of any forward-looking strategy relies on for relevance. Many Filipinos, for example, lack running water, indoor plumbing, and access to safe and efficient transportation. All that’s been going on for decades. But are those things treated like some sort of ongoing crisis? Not really. “The poor” are happy to elect the same public officials who had long maintained those status quos. So who cares, right? Their vote, their accountability. What makes COVID any different? It’ll just be another one of those day-to-day risks in the Philippines that the poor are at a disadvantage to mitigate but are at the bottom of the List of Things to Worry About of the rich and promising. That’s the status quo.
Want to change that status quo? Having a COVID-19 “Strategy” will not do that for you — specially one that is full of all the Whats-to-Dos that lend well to media sound bytes and campaign slogans and utterly thin on the How-Tos. To change the status quo, a leader needs to be transformational — not one whose entire campaign platform rests on shrill reactiveness.",Others
Leni Robredo and Manny Pacquiao jointly EXPLOIT devastation wrought by Typhoon Odette for political gain,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/leni-robredo-and-manny-pacquiao-jointly-exploit-devastation-wrought-by-typhoon-odette-for-political-gain/,"True to the unimaginative character of the Opposition campaign led by Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo, Typhoon Odette’s visit this weekend presented what seemed to be a grand opportunity for Robredo and her pinky team to, well, grandstand before the cameras. An added bonus was boxing champ and rival presidential candidate calling for various partisan camps to pool resources to “help out” in the relief effort. Perhaps not surprisingly, only Robredo responded to the call. Not surprising, is the meeting of the two minds to exploit this opportunity to perform for the cameras. Both, after all, run the two most intellectually-bankrupt campaigns in these national elections.
What do two politicians with an obvious agenda really have to offer to the most recent victims of what is, in essence, just another garden-variety typhoon very much familiar to Filipinos of any generation? Between the two, only Robredo is an actual executive government official (or so we are told by those who believe that she actually won the vice presidency in 2016). Pacquiao is a senator and, as such, not one whose official role is to direct public services. Robredo like Pacquiao, however, does not have command over any state resources that are in the best position to deliver disaster response and relief services at scale. Only the president who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the executive ultimately in charge of the police and Coast Guard exercises any influence on how resources are allocated to the effort.
The best Robredo could do is to employ a combination of (1) the resources she is authorised to deploy from her own Office of the Vice President, (2) the resources funded by her campaign contributions, (3) her own personal resources, and (4) contributions collected through the parallel fundraising initiatives she and her supporters organised. Step back and take stock of all this and we will see that it is a mishmash of state and politically-motivated resources that supports this “relief effort”. On top of all this sits Leni Robredo’s political brand which, in turn, gives dishonest credence to the notion that she is the one person to thank for this service of purportedly national proportions and that all the rest don’t measure up.
How else could one possibly believe that all of what Robredo exhibits is part of a genuine initiative to serve the public if Robredo’s cheerleaders routinely inject traditional mudslinging into their cheers? Pacquiao for his part was clear as to what the spirit of the effort should have been. His original call to his fellow presidential bets was to “come together and set aside politics to help people”. Clearly, Robredo and her titas don’t seem to be getting into the spirit of things.
What most of those who are quick to lap up the insidious messianic messages underlying Robredo’s and, to a lesser extent, Pacquiao’s posturing over the course of Odette’s visit fail to appreciate is that disaster response and relief operations are only the tip of the iceberg that is the overall state apparatus to build the right capabilities and maintain a state of readiness to mitigate the country’s risk exposure to natural calamities. Robredo is the proverbial heroic fireman who gets featured in all the movies and children’s books. Uncelebrated are the people who do the more mundane jobs like keeping the fire extinguishers fresh, implementing safety systems, and keeping people informed and drilled on emergency fire procedures.
As President Rodrigo Duterte points out, you can’t be president if your idea of leading is to be there just to play that heroic fireman before the cameras. That’s not being a leader. That’s just being an asshole.",Others
Is Leni Robredo really SINGLE-HANDEDLY on top of the Typhoon Odette relief effort?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/12/is-leni-robredo-really-single-handedly-on-top-of-the-typhoon-odette-relief-effort/,"If we are to believe Chief Yellowtard “economist” JC Punongbayan, presidential candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo is the only person really on top of the relief operations surrounding the havoc wrought by Typhoon Ria (local codename “Odette”).
Rappler and ABS-CBN say so, his fellow Yellowtards say so, and Robredo herself says so. So it must be so. Punongbayan mirrors the attitude applied by the Yellowtard-led Opposition to their campaign — that they are the only ones with all the ideas on how to run the country.
“Tomorrow, our relief operations will resume. Ang assurance ko po sa inyo, mapupuntahan lahat ng lugar na nasalanta. Kung hindi po ako mismo dahil solong katawan po ako, iyong teams po namin…lahat ng lugar, maaabot po ng teams namin on the ground kasi halos anim na taon na namin itong ginagawa,” Robredo said.
(My assurance to you is that we will reach all the places that have been hit. If I cannot go there myself, our teams on the ground will be able to reach you because this is something we have been doing for almost six years.)
Robredo speaks as if the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Coast Guard, the Philippine Police, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the various local governments don’t exist. It’s as if she and her team are single-handedly saving the day.
Considering that much of this “relief effort” will ultimately serve as fodder for Robredo’s desperate campaign, it could well be that hers is very likely Philippine history’s most dishonest election campaign. She is effectively campaigning at the expense of her own government and is seriously and deliberately misleading the Filipino public.
If Robredo has any decency left in her, she should apologise to every government employee and public servant who is working hard and working quietly to do deliver essential services to Filipinos impacted by this disaster.",Others
Platform or agenda to DISRUPT local governance status quo critical post-2022 to address persisting COVID-19 impact to ordinary Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/platform-or-agenda-to-disrupt-local-governance-status-quo-critical-post-2022-to-address-persisting-covid-19-impact-to-ordinary-filipinos/,"Devolution. This was the spirit in which Nene Pimentel authored the Local Government Code of 1991. Pimentel and Ruben Canoy were the leaders of the federal movement which was fledgling then. Since the movement couldn’t find legs to stand on, Pimentel decided that devolution was the next best option. The local government code was passed but local government units (LGUs) were hard-pressed raising revenues because of the lack of development, specially in the regions. Third-class municipalities are dependent on internal revenue allotments (IRAs) to deliver the most basic of services to its constituents. The increase IRA allotment is not necessarily a boon for LGUs as they have issues with absorptive capacity.
Cielito Habito writes in his Inquirer piece “Déjà vu on devolution” looking back to 1992 when  “the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 (Republic Act 7160) had just become law, and its implementation ‘shook the bureaucracy to the core,’ as former Local Government Academy chief Dr. Alex Brillantes Jr. described it”.
The reality is that notwithstanding the LGC, [national government agencies (NGAs)] persisted in a centralized, top-down mode of management, and continued with national programs and procurements that force-fed template solutions to address widely divergent requirements. Rather than take matters into their own hands, now is the time for them to truly work with, and work through, the provincial LGUs, who can in turn coordinate the lower levels of governance. Meanwhile, the reduced budgets of the NGAs are best spent for steering, and especially for capacitating, provincial LGUs to do their job. LGUs should finally be allowed to do the rowing.
What comes into play again here is the bureaucracy’s structure which is large, unwieldy and staffed with unqualified personnel. The pandemic has revealed the soft underbelly of the national economy. The lack of regional development proved that the economy has been most affected by the pandemic. Forty percent of the national economic activity is in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). Residents in the regions survive because of agriculture and fishing. If it were not for these then there would be pockets of unrest due to more people joining the New People’s Army (NPA). To an extent, this has been minimized by the development which has taken place at a snail-like pace since 1986. But there are the poorest provinces where poverty, unemployment and malnutrition are all running high.
Pre-pandemic Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez already made a statement about the funding shortfall for the increased IRA because of the increased spending by the national government on education, public health and infrastructure. This has been made worse by the pandemic. The other side of the issue is absorptive capacity of the LGUs. This should also be an election issue. It’s time that charter change be seriously looked at. Federalism was one of the campaign promises of then candidate Duterte. There have been several announcements in the past by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) but nothing has materialized. Congress is now working on the basic amendment of the economic provisions of the Constitution and the eighty-five year old Public Service Act but these do nothing for capacity-building at the LGU level. This is an important issue because any Presidential candidate should have a clear economic plan of action moving forward.
COVID-19 is not going to go away anytime soon and the public cannot be in a state of suspended animation over the basic issues which are a factor in their daily lives. The increased IRA would also have less impact if the budget is legislated at the national level. Congressmen represent their districts but the power structure in Congress is such that deal-making is the norm which results in vested interests being taken into account with constituents needs being a far second. The pandemic has made disruption a necessity. We need new leaders who are capable of thinking outside-of-the-box for solutions to the problems we face as a nation.",Others
COMELEC party to Yellowtard anti-Marcos campaign thanks to Commissioner Rowena Guanzon and spokesman James Jimenez,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/comelec-party-to-yellowtard-anti-marcos-campaign-thanks-to-commissioner-rowena-guanzon-and-spokesman-james-jimenez/,"One would think that a hearing conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and presided over by one of its top officials, Commissioner Rowena Guanzon, would be above partisan politics. The COMELEC, after all, is an election governance body and the Filipino public accords it their trust under the premise that it maintains an objectivite distance from partisanship. Thus it is a baffling sight to behold seeing this noble agency reduced to being a party to the vilification campaign being sustained by the Opposition led by its dominant Yellowtard bloc against leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos.
One wonders why today’s proceedings to review disqualification petitions against Marcos’s candidacy were held up by his absence. Guanzon herself, in a tweet, led everyone to believe that Marcos’s presence at the hearing was an absolute requirement.
This was echoed by COMELEC spokesman James Jimenez as well in a tweet issued at about the same time.
Note, however that a Manila Bulletin report published on the 4th January quotes Jimenez stating that Marcos and the petitioners “are not required to attend. This is usually attended by counsel only”.
Guanzon also notably references a tweet issued by a member or supporter of one of the petitioner groups. The tweet exhibits images of partisan paraphernalia that expresses support for the disqualification of Marcos from these elections. That Guanzon would show this sort of partiality to one party in this hearing is inappropriate considering she is the presiding official in this exercise.
Thanks to the unbecoming actions of Guanzon and Jimenez, the COMELEC has become the source of a lot of social media chatter surrounding what is essentially a non-issue. Rather than contribute clarity to the discourse, this agency is sowing confusion! It raises the possibility that this case, which does not actually hold any legal water, was more an exercise meant to put Marcos through the wringer before the cameras. It explains why his presence (which actually wasn’t required) was made out to be so important.
Guanzon, after all, is a known Yellowtard and many observers are adamant that she was privy to the real agenda of this proceeding — to lynch Marcos and use the outcome of that lynching to bolster the floundering campaign of Yellowtard presidential candidate Leni Robredo. If true, this is nothing short of a dastardly and dishonest initiative to be a party to and Guanzon and Jimenez ought to be ashamed of themselves.",Others
"Senate Defense Committee under Ping Lacson pushing bills to upgrade AFP/PNP benefits, follows thru on Duterte promises",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/senate-defense-committee-under-ping-lacson-pushing-consolidating-bills-to-upgrade-afp-pnp-benefits-follows-thru-on-duterte-promises/,"While the Opposition continues to push the government for fiscal stimulus and social amelioration funds for Filipinos most affected by the pandemic, the same individuals appear to be indifferent to the looming fiscal crisis brought about by the huge deficit in the pension fund of police, military and other uniformed government personnel. The present shortfall as estimated by the Government Service Insurance System is P9.6 trillion. The amount is equivalent to 50% of the GDP of the country pre-pandemic. President Rodrigo Duterte raised the issue during his State of the Nation Address (SONA) last July 2020 and, since then, Congressman Joey Salceda has filed House Bill No. 9593 which finally addresses the need to establish a unified pension fund system for government uniformed personnel.
The pension fund crisis was triggered by the bankruptcy of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Retirement and Separation Benefits System (RSBS) in 1998 based on a Senate Blue Ribbon Committee Report which was submitted after an investigation into alleged anomalous transactions by its officials. The AFP-RSBS was established in December 30, 1973 by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 361 issued by then President Ferdinand Marcos. AFP personnel had been complaining about delayed pension benefits for the longest time. This was one of the long-standing grievances of AFP personnel which made them easy targets for recruitment by officers who led coup attempts and other destabilization plots against the government from 1986 to 2001. This was consistent with the findings of the Feliciano Commission, which was formed after the Oakwood Mutiny in July 27, 2003 when the Magdalo Group seized the Oakwood Serviced Residences Complex in the Makati CBD by AFP and PNP SAF personnel. On December 15, 2006, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) issued Executive Order 590 dissolving the AFP-RSBS and transferred its assets to the Land Bank and Development Bank of the Philippines under the supervision of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In June 2019, Duterte signed Congress Joint Resolution No. 1, which authorized an increase in the base pay of retired military and uniformed personnel (MUP) providing relief to some 200,000 retirees.
The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on Tuesday released the requirements of retired military uniformed personnel  Armed Forces of the Philippines – General Headquarters (AFP-GHQ), Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP).
The DBM said it released P29.9 billion to the AFP-GHQ, P21.7 billion to the PNP, P1.9 billion to the BFP, and around P731 million to the BJMP.
Senator Panfilo Lacson, the Chair of the Senate Committee on National Defense, presided over the hearing last May 20, 2021, which included representatives from the other concerned committees including Government Corporations and Public Enterprises, Ways and Means and Finance. Lacson is pushing for the approval of the consolidated Senate Bills as there are several which have been filed since 2019. Also present at the hearing was National Treasurer Rosalia De Leon, representing the Department of Finance headed by Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Uniformed government personnel pensions are higher by nine times compared to the average amount received by a Social Security System (SSS) pensioner and three times higher than the average Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) pension because it is indexed to current salary grades. No contribution is made by uniformed personnel unlike civil servants under the Civil Service Commission who contribute their monthly share from their salaries.
It is only under the Duterte administration that Senator Lacson has found a strong ally in addressing the plight of uniformed government personnel, particularly the members of the AFP and the PNP. At present, the pension fund is financed by a direct allocation from the annual national budget. It includes the men and women under the Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Fire Protection, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, the Bureau of Corrections and the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority.
On behalf of the 220,000 MUP retirees, let me say a lifetime “THANK YOU” to PRRD for Joint Resolution No 1. No other president has shown such concern for those who served and offered their lives for country and people. All we have to do is continue breathing for as long as we can
— PING LACSON (@iampinglacson) June 13, 2019
It is easy for Opposition stalwarts to shout stimulus and ayuda at the top of their lungs without taking into account the big picture. Senator Lacson and Albay Representative Salceda are both known for their diligence and insistence on complete staff work which are both necessary in the passage of quality legislation which addresses all of the issues. It is unfortunate that the Opposition continues to criticize the administration and legislators who are helping it address the serious problems caused by the pandemic, particularly the allocation of scarce financial resources due to the drastic decrease in revenue collection. We actually need to elect more experienced and responsible legislators in the Senate and House of Representatives. We should exercise the same due diligence in analyzing the qualifications of candidates in the coming 2022 election.",Others
Senate Bill No. 23 (BRAVE Bill) aims to make pork barrel corruption a thing of the past,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/senate-bill-no-23-brave-bill-aims-to-make-pork-barrel-corruption-a-thing-of-the-past/,"Probably unknown to many, Senator Panfilo Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 23 last July 2, 2019. The Budget Reform Advocacy for Village Empowerment (BRAVE) seeks to empower local government units throughout the country down to the barangay level by allocating development funds which cannot be impounded by the national government. In a speech delivered on the occasion of the Baguio Charter Day celebration in 2019, Lacson highlighted its key rationale. “It would be a waste if the budget coming from national agencies would not be equitably distributed to the local development plans of the LGUs. This will be a very big help as they will have to compete for their development and not to wait for the national government for funding support which is a dole out mentality,” he said.
The development funds would be released on a quarterly basis to each local government unit (LGU). Under the bill, provinces would receive P500M – P1 billion per year, cities up to P200 million per year, municipalities P50 million to P100 million per year and barangays up to P3 million to P5 million per year. The local development fund (LDF) for each province, city or town will be based on the 50 percent of the prescribed amount for first-class LGUs, 60 percent of the prescribed amount for second-class LGUs, 70 percent of the prescribed amount for third-class LGUs, 80 percent of the prescribed amount for fourth-class LGUs, 90 percent of the prescribed amount for fifth-class LGUs, and 100 percent of the prescribed amount for sixth-class LGUs.
Lacson has also instituted safeguards for the funds to be spent efficiently and productively by specifying that the LDF will not be released without a certification from the Local Government Academy that the LGU is capacitated to plan and implement its comprehensive development Plan. However, the LDF will not be released without a certification from the Local Government Academy that the LGU is capacitated to plan and implement its comprehensive development plan. The LDF funds may not also be spent for items that are not related to or connected with the development projects, activities and programs (PAPs). LDF funds cannot be spent for PAPs that may duplicate or overlap with PAPs implemented by the national government agencies. Neither shall they be used as a counterpart fund to support national government agencies’ identified PAPs. A yearly performance review of the LGUs’ implementation of their programs will also be conducted. LGUs which fail to make the grade may have their LDFs slashed by 50 percent the following year, and terminated in case of two annual consecutive negative performance reviews. For its part, the Local Government Academy will establish a continuing capacity program for LGUs, to make sure LGUs are capacitated to plan and implement development projects in order to ensure that each LGUs absorptive capacity is upgraded in terms of the technical and rollout aspects. A web-based monitoring system will be adopted. Information accessible to the public may include funding/cost, location, contractor, progress status, number of beneficiaries, date of completion and responsible government official, of the PAPs. A sunset review of the law will be done after five years or as the need arises, to determine remedial legislation, in order to address the change in the needs of the LGUs due to increased demand for government services.
Lacson looks to hit two birds with one stone with the BRAVE Bill; break the continuing perpetuation of the pork barrel system in its latest form and decrease the practice of political patronage with the dependence by the LGUs in the release of their internal revenue allotments (IRA). The LDF is separate and distinct from the IRA. The LGUs are supposed to receive an internal revenue allotment (IRA) windfall in 2022 when the Mandanas ruling takes effect but, given the present pandemic crisis, the national government is hard-pressed for funding sources due to the decline in tax collections. The BRAVE Bill aims to be a remedial measure given the existing fiscal environment. It also aims to address the deficit in absorptive capacity of the LGUs which was not addressed by the Local Government Code of 1991 when certain functions of the national government were devolved to the LGUs. BRAVE can also be fiscal stimulus at the local level as the development projects will spur economic activity and employment. It is akin to a local version of the BBB program at the national level.
This is the kind of legislation that our lawmakers should come up with in place of self-serving and vested-interest projects funded by the pork barrel. Lacson has been assiduous in his advocacy of budget reform and the elimination of the pork barrel system which is also part and parcel of his other advocacy of minimizing corruption in government.
The Senator has declared that he may not run for reelection and opt for retirement or make a bid for the Presidency in tandem with Senate President Tito Sotto. Lacson’s retirement as a legislator would be a loss to the Senate as his work in scrutinizing the national budget during the bicameral conference committee meetings has resulted in savings for the public because this is where the insertions are made for lump-sum appropriations. Lacson has proven to be consistent in his performance as Senator since he was first elected in 2001. It will be interesting to see what he finally decides on as October draws near.",Others
Incoming PCOO Head Trixie Cruz Angeles is Showing She’s Way Above Her Pay Grade and Other Emerging Appointment Booboos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/incoming-pcoo-head-trixie-cruz-angeles-is-showing-shes-way-above-her-pay-grade-and-other-emerging-appointment-booboos/,"On the matter of getting appointed to a cabinet position or government agency under the incoming second Marcos administration, it does well to behave with the humility and restraint of my best friend’s Aunty, Dr. Clarita Carlos.
Yes, that one.
When I came across an excel sheet that had the name of a government agency in one column and next to it was her name, I congratulated her.
She responded, “Paul, (it’s) just a list… hahaha!”
(I could probably write another blog on the significance of ellipses-followed-by-hahaha in everyday exchanges on instant messaging apps, but I’ll leave that digression for another time.)
If she had been mayabang or arrogant as some had depicted her to be, my guess is she would have hinted one way or another that she was up for a different position.
She’s sharp and feisty, sure. And this could sometimes be interpreted by the usual timid and meek looking Pinoy as mapagmataas. Sure!
But, I don’t think I have ever seen her count her chicks in public before they hatched in the way some other BBM appointees have — which to me, is pagmamayabang.
In fact, I’ve known her to almost always only say way much less than what she knows and this is the reason why I was pleasantly surprised when word spread that a certain Dr. Carlos was appointment as our incoming National Security Adviser.
I haven’t read much else said about her appointment or any word about how she is organizing the National Security Council Secretariat. I tend to believe that, owing to the nature of the office as well as Dr. Clarita’s character, little else will be said.
Because, after all, between the announcement and the rigors of getting the final green light from the Committee on Appointments is still quite a stretch.
Not a time to be seen doling out positions and favors.
In sharp contrast, the appointment of Trixie Cruz Angeles as the head of the Presidential Communications Operations Office caused quite a bit of a stir even before it was officially announced.
Before it was announced, friends in BBM’s camp were mentioning Angeles along with Ambassador Bobi Tiglao. Not a few figured that Tiglao would head the PCOO while Angeles would become one of the Presidential spokespersons.
As much as I find Tiglao’s tirades sometimes way out there and at other times too harsh, I’ve grown quite used to it and believe that what comes across in various media is fairly authentic. He’s a mean and cranky old man just like a couple of my friends and myself — that’s probably why I like him.
(I would have preferred Ambassador Babe Romualdez for the position but I’ve heard he’s up to replace Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin.)
If Tiglao had been appointed as the PCOO Secretary, it would have definitely struck fear in the hearts of BBM’s committed detractors.
Angeles on the other hand… hahaha!
Well, a disclaimer might be appropriate at this point. I met her and “worked” with her at a friend’s boutique PR firm way back in 2009. My friend said she was helping his PR firm with legal work as a consultant and also brought in some crisis management clients.
Back then, my impression was that apart from her work as an attorney for some people, she also contracted the services of PR firms and freelance publicists/journalists.
I even sat at a meeting where matters were discussed about an ongoing somewhat legal dispute between a shopping mall and local government unit. In the flow of discussions, there was an impression that Angeles was guiding both sides of the dispute in the way that US arms manufacturers aid fledgling democratic governments and freedom fighters.
An old blog post by a former colleague at RPN9 seems to describe the situation better than I can from my own recollection. In this post, the writer seems to have re-posted an account of Angeles’ dealings by Argee Guevarra — a former business partner of Angeles:
Sometime in May 2009, we accepted Gotesco mall owners’ request for us to render politico-legal services to prevent Caloocan City Mayor Recom Echiverri from gaining control and possession of the disputed mall. On the eve of the well-publicized takeover, she informed me that she will meet with some representatives of Recom. This supposed meeting was arranged by Amiel Cabanlig (a gay, bayaran blogger who always attacks PNoy in www.donavictorina.com and whose claim to social importance is bragging about his being a ka-chongkee and ka-cocaine of Mike Defensor).
I asked her why she needs to meet representatives of Recom and she informed me that Recom’s group wants to “pay us off” so that we abandon our clients. I allowed her to meet with the representatives but only to listen and spy as to their intentions and tactics. I gave her strict orders not to accept or make any deal that would compromise our existing attorney-client relationship with Gotesco Mall owners.
A week later, we were able to accomplish our tasks for which we received partial payment for our attorney’s fees.
Weeks after the Gotesco mall incident and considering my unwillingness to follow-up on the full payment of our attorney’s fees from the notoriously stingy and shrewd Gotesco mall owners, I just assigned the task to Trixie.
At around that time, she introduced to me her supposed estranged “husband” Atty. “Estanislao” Bong Angeles, a Utopia fraternity brod of Recom who approached me and who came up with a story about some Commission on Audit finding that he said could coerce or compel the Gotesco mall owners into paying us our remaining balance.
Since I don’t understand much about audit procedures, I just referred Trixie to my contacts in Gotesco mall and even accompanied her once to a meeting where nothing was actually accomplished because Trixie was herself vague of her husband’s idea or did not understand the importance of this supposed COA finding.
(Image of this portion of the blog post below)
(You may read the rest of the post here )
She has probably evolved much more since then.
Somehow, she must have cozied up with the Pnoy Administration and became Vice Chairman of the National Committee on Monuments and Sites.
Perhaps as a sign of her fealty to the Yellow Lord born by Yellow Saint Cory, she even tweeted back in February 25, 2013 that “True justice is when we see at least Imelda Marcos in jail.”
The Tweet received a number of comments and the most striking one was from a certain Bettina Monfort who said, “The son did not have anything to do with what his father did but might be punished for it.”
To which she retorted, “Not true that he did not have anything to do with the father. He uses ill gotten wealth. That is complicity after the fact.”
Since then, she became not only a social media influencer, but also a talk radio personality as well as a columnist — if I am not mistaken. Her successful foray in media might have been somewhat necessitated by her three year suspension by the Supreme Court in 2016.
There was even a point where she was or seemed to be the adviser for Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson and I am not sure that worked out well, if at all. If memory serves me correctly, this was the time when Asec. Uson got embroiled in a number of controversies which I would rather not enumerate because it seems to have flowed from one into another.
Aaaaand now she’s the PCOO Secretary designate.
If at all, her appointment is a sign that BBM is remaining true and committed to his campaign slogan of UNITY and it should be welcomed… nay! APPLAUDED!
I mean, why not? Was it not said by Abraham Lincoln or whoever that “I destroy by enemies by making them my friends.”
Angeles’ team mates, I overheard, confoundingly credit BBM’s largesse rather than Angeles’ prowess as a lawyer and communicator.
With a budget reportedly amounting to P1.9 billion, giving the PCOO to Angeles is INDEED an act of Marcosian largesse approaching almost legendary proportions.
That’s really far from the days when she was supposedly ousted by her law classmates when photocopying money supposedly in her care disappeared. Oh well, I don’t think the PCOO needs to outsource its photocopying requirements… or does it? We shall see.
Imagine, instead of having her shot in the face, having all her silicone parts wrenched from her body, or water tortured in the Pasig River for calling for BBM and his mother’s imprisonment, he does the complete opposite and gives her a plum position.
Which makes Angeles’ teammates envy understandable because they’re the ones I overheard talking about how she already earned the ire of one of BBM’s biggest political and financial supporters.
The story goes that Angeles received a call from the fuming Bigtime BBM supporter and I imagined her disintegrating under the hail of curse words coming from the other end of the line.
Anyway, according to Angeles’ team mate the caller was supposed to have said, “Trixie, I heard that you are appointing someone in PTFOMS. Is it true? Akin yan! Hindi PCOO yan.”
PTFOMS or the Presidential Task Force on Media Security was organized to help journalists who are under threats of harm or intimidation arising from reporting on illegal activities.
Angeles was said to have mumbled some sort of explanation but the Bigtime BBM Supporter just shouted back, “NO. That’s just what I want you to know.”
Thing is, according to Trixie’s teammate, she was not at all aware of how the PCOO is organized and how it works alongside other government agencies with functions ancillary to the Presidential communications.
As far as I understand, PTFOMS is under the Office of the President and works alongside PCOO. It is an essential component of a larger media policy implementation program designed to promote press freedom. In my mind, the Duterte media policy program includes the Freedom of Information Project Management Office.
Angeles’ teammate further explains that what caused her to go out of bounds in “handing out positions” was that her media cronies were bugging her none stop.
Thing is, and this is a crucial point, Angeles doesn’t yet have any power to hand out or even promise any position to anyone.
That’s not only counting chicks before they’re hatched, it’s selling a tray of eggs as lechon manok and apparently, someone bought the whole lot!
As it turns out, a group that wants to place one of its lackeys as the head of PTFOMS has been attacking the agency’s performance and propping up the profile of one Edu Punay as a replacement for the current PTFOMS head.
Edu Punay is reporter for the Philippine Star and Angeles’ teammate says he feels entitled to head the PTFOMS because he had printed one or two stories favorable to BBM.
A screenshot sent to me shows one of Punay’s friends congratulating him prematurely for being designated as PTFOMS head. It would not be unimaginable that Angeles or Punay may have spread the word of the designation way too early.
This did not sit well with the REAL transition committee, the one actually in charge of vetting the appointments for various positions in the BBM cabinet.
The actual words were, “Hindi pala nila alam yung ginagawang encroachment ni Trixie sa powers ng Office of the President. Bakit daw pinapangakuan ng position and nagpaplaning mag reorganize when hindi niya sakop yun and wala siyang power to appoint.”
In not so many words, pointed remarks were made about Punay’s eager beaver attitude towards getting a post.
Angeles teammate reveals, “Punay’s team resorted to all kinds of dirty tricks to blighten the record of PTFOMS. Even coming out with an editorial in a tabloid kung saan connected si Punay. Obvious na galaw niya.”
It was also said that Punay disparaged and belittled the current head of the PTFOMS, saying “wala siya sa kalingkingan ko.”
That’s the thing with some journos working for big media outfits, they inadvertently identify as the media outfit as if they had built it from the ground up. Colleagues of his from way back say that Punay wouldn’t have a had a headline story or a noteworthy byline if it hadn’t been enterprised by other reporters FIRST or leaked to him by very friendly sources.
Apart from Punay’s media campaign for the PTFOMS appointment, Angeles’ teammate also reveals that Punay pressured the reported PCOO Secretary designate by resigning from his media outfit. (Then again, I guess Punay might have been pressured as well by his media outfit to resign or get fired for moonlighting as a PR freelancer. It is unethical to work as a publicist while employed as a journalist.)
Word coming from another source is that Trixie may be on their way out even before they she officially steps in as PCOO Secretary.

Dole out campaigning: Be wary of skewed and distorted electoral promises that could damage the economy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/dole-out-campaigning-be-wary-of-skewed-and-distorted-electoral-promises-that-could-damage-the-economy/,"The election season has started in the Philippines, with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) finalizing the list of candidates vying for various positions in the public office. While the aforementioned commission is performing its stipulated duties and powers afforded to it by the 1987 Constitution, candidates running for nationally-elected positions are creating their own platforms where they propose solutions that attempt to address various economic, political, and social malaise that the country is suffering from. These solutions vary, whether they are legislative in nature or executive in form, depending on which position they are vying for. It sounds complicated, but this pandemic-induced economic contraction further adds convolution to how politicians format their electoral promises in a manner that earns the trust of the electorate.
One of the biggest words that will definitely come out would be dole outs, or more commonly known as “ayuda”. These dole outs already come out in two general forms: (1) through cash distribution programs or (2) through relief goods and items that include food, clothing, and other necessities required for daily living. The former, which is the more common form of ayuda, is when an amount of money is directly given in cash by the government. With COVID-19 destroying livelihoods and employment opportunities from the various sectors of the Philippine economy, it is doubtless that these dole outs have helped many Filipinos wade through the waves of lockdowns, community infection transmissions, and economic downturn.
Outside the Philippines, the Global North did not hesitate to power up their money printing machines, which can be easily accessed by their citizens in various forms. In neighboring Japan, the administration of then Prime Minister Abe issued a one-time JPY100,000 (around Php50,000) financial assistance per person that is available to all residents. In addition, the Go To campaign was also launched to jump-start the tourism industry which suffered tremendously due to the pandemic. Restaurants were also given a monthly stipend assistance, provided that they strictly follow COVID-19 guidelines in their business operations. Beyond the Pacific Ocean, the administrations of then President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden pushed for pandemic alleviation packages worth trillions of dollars which were deliberated in their respective legislative bodies in the United States. The European Union has also created a solidarity fund that aims to provide financial assistance towards their fellow member states hit hardly by the pandemic. Indeed, helicopter money was being rained down on these liberal democracies and to their constituents.
When one hears of these generous dole outs in first world countries, it is tempting for many Filipino politicians who wish to be elected to promise more financial assistance towards their potential voters come 2022. They might publicly announce that they will help the public through a welfare system that will literally put cash into the pockets of less-fortunate Filipinos. Unfortunately, with a relatively fiscally illiterate electorate in the Philippines, many voters would end up becoming victims of their own right to suffrage specially when these elected politicians engage in underhanded public or private transactions. Nevertheless, the three syllables forming the word “ayuda” sound like music to the ears of gullible voters. Furthermore, some sectors of the society applaud this kind of wealth distribution system, which I personally think is more detrimental in nation-building.
In economic terms, dole outs can be classified as a method of wealth distribution performed by the government that aim to provide temporary financial relief to the members of the community. The hope in this is that the channelled money would ramp up consumption of goods and services, thus stimulating the whole economy. Leftist politicians and left-leaning groups would pronounce that wealth distribution is a method of promoting social justice, while Catholics and other Christian denominations would preach that the virtue of generosity is manifests itself in wealth distribution. However, I beg to disagree with these individuals, specially when one considers how inefficient and ineffective doling out systems are a waste of taxpayers’ resources. Dole outs are mere band-aid solutions that are never meant to last. Distributing wealth does not generate wealth and, instead, diminishes its intrinsic value.
British stateswoman Margaret Thatcher in her final book Statecraft, identified five important factors that can make capitalism function well. These are private ownership, culture of entrepreneurship, rule of law, competition, and limited government intervention. All of these factors can also be found in Friedrich Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, which denounced socialism and collectivism. As a consumption-based economy, the Philippines has the potential to make capitalism work. It is therefore imperative for the country’s policy makers to adhere to these five stipulations. The direct beneficiaries of this approach would be all Filipino citizens and residents, who are both consumers and producers of various goods and services in their own right in the free market.
It is paramount that elected officials be sensitive and humane to the needs of the electorate. However, my proposition is to ascertain that these dole out programs would target recipients who need the most assistance, while aiming to increase the productivity of the general economy by creating an environment fertile for businesses that generate employment. A more circumspect view of balancing various needs is a must, since a spiral of uncontrolled cash circulating in the economy would dilute the country’s economic gains as its players battle against the damage caused by the pandemic. Of course, aggressive investments paired with government assistance towards social infrastructure that improves connectivity while reducing bureaucracy is also highly ideal.
However, the government’s resources and powers aren’t unlimited specially with the self-inflicting restrictions stipulated by the current constitution regarding foreign direct investments. Many constitutionalists quickly point to nationalism, which hasn’t even brought food to the tables of the marginalized sectors of the society. Intentions are noble, but that is where they end. What we need is to elect candidates who will open up the Philippine market by advocating structural changes that correct the missteps caused by the current constitution. It is through wealth generation — not wealth distribution — that every Filipino’s living standards would improve.
With calls for more effort regarding wealth distribution getting louder and stronger in the elections, the electorate should never fall victim to these skewed and distorted electoral promises that cause more harm than what is initially intended. We should be resilient against the temptations of enlarging the government, lest we fall as a country of dependent mendicants.",Others
The most important election issues for 2022. Take note: being “anti-Marcos” is NOT one of them,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/the-most-important-election-issues-for-2022-take-note-being-anti-marcos-is-not-one-of-them/,"With the Presidential candidates cast more or less complete, the time has come for the questions we should ask each of them that will guide us in determining who is in the position to lead the country over the next six years. It shouldn’t be about Aquino versus Marcos again or looming authoritarianism against freedom and democracy. It should be what affects the average Pinoy and what they intend to do about it.
The following are some of the more important issues under each subject:
Agriculture – food security, agricultural products imports, increasing production to meet demand, reforms in rice production particularly the power of traders to control market prices, the development of an agricultural products export manufacturing industry similar to Thailand and Vietnam.
Information Technology – what is the status of the national broadband network? Digitization of the bureaucracy, particularly the development of a blockchain backend system to automate transactions and minimize corruption, the development of a robust startup ecosystem encouraging local government units (LGUs) to implement a smart cities strategy, the continuing improvement of connectivity and internet speed.
Foreign Policy – independent, non-aligned or aligned with a major power or grouping? Regional foreign policy; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Quad. The US versus China rivalry. AUKUS (the UK, US and Australia alliance) which might lead to increased tensions due to the eventual deployment of nuclear-capable submarines by Australia.
Energy Security – the final decision on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP), nuclear versus renewables versus geothermal. The reform of Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) to remove cartel-like behavior among producers and distributors. The policy on the Recto Bank service contract and joint-exploration in the South China Sea.
Public Health – implementation of Universal Healthcare. Pandemic response moving forward under the assumption Covid is endemic. The implementation of test, treat and trace. Improvement of frontline health services at the barangay level while the hospital capacity is being built-up. Working conditions and compensation of healthcare workers.
The Economy – economic recovery program. Will the new administration continue with the policies of the Department of Finance (DOF) and the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)? If not what will change? How to bring back revenue collection to pre-pandemic levels? Debt policy? Borrowing mix? Is 5% of GDP commitment for infrastructure projects still policy? How to transition from consumption-driven to export-driven economy?
Socio-political reform – What about federalism? Charter change (“cha-cha”) to reform the bureaucracy once and for all and minimize losses due to corruption. Switch from bicameral to unicameral parliamentary system. National security – end the insurgency once and for all. Renewed threat of terrorism and Islamic fundamentalists due to the Taliban control of Afghanistan and the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Western Mindanao.
Education – the adoption of Education 4.0 for private and public educational institutions. How to help private educational institutions from the pandemic-induced drop in enrolment? Address the corruption in the Department of Education (DepEd) and the fraud in faculty credentials resulting in unqualified promotion to next higher rank.
These are the pertinent issues voters should be concerned about as we are in a crucial crossroad in the country’s history due to the pandemic. Don’t fall for the democracy versus dictatorship narrative of Yellowidiots turned pinkos and the Reds who are pursuing a self-serving agenda while corrupting the country’s youth by encouraging misguided activism. There are huge stakes in the future of the Philippines moving forward in the next six years.",Others
The Houston Astros are Baseball’s Equivalent of Andy Bautista,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/the-houston-astros-are-baseballs-equivalent-of-andy-bautista/,"The baseball season has ended. A rare professional sports final that resembles a WWE pay per view. A final matchup where there is clear cut bad guy and the good guy is whoever is on the other side. The last time there was anything like this was the 2011 NBA final where everybody became a Dallas Mavericks fan because they hated the Boyz II Men pep rally LeBron, Wade and Bosch promised not one , not two ……… championships .
Back in 2017 , the Houston Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers  in the World Series and people cheered them on . That was a team that succeeded where the Philadelphia 76ers failed. They amassed a lot of talent picking high in the draft and those players blossomed at the right Time. That feel good story soon came tumbling down when a former pitcher of that team , Mike Fiers decided to break the code  of    Omertà  and told the baseball world how they cheated.
The Astros were able to steal the opposing catchers signs then the results were communicated to the batter on the plate using banging on garbage cans and even electronic devices that would make FBI informers proud.
The cheating scandal was noteworthy at this point but MLB botched both the investigation and ensuing discipline . They were honestly hoping for all this to go away and it did not. When the fit hit the shan, we were in Johnny Mathis , Denice Williams territory .
MLB promised immunity to the players in exchange for information . Armed with this , MLB then used that information and expelled the manager and the general manager.   What MLB did is akin to the band aid solution that caused the problem in the movie Poltergeist. They removed the gravestones but kept the bodies in the ground. This put a target on the Houston Astros franchise.
We already had a flaccid solution thank you Major League baseball.. There was no consequence to the players. They kept the money and they kept the championship. At least they would have suffered the wrath of the fans on the road right?? Of course 2020 and COVID was the perfect storm for a great many things in this world. Maybe the one organization in the whole world that benefited from COVID was the Houston Astros. The teams generally played  in front of groundskeepers and minimum security. The one team that should be booed and who deserved to be booed had nobody in 2020 to boo them.
When the 2021 season came, the Astros still had all the money and the championship and all the arrogance. They didn’t even publicly feel bad about their bosses who paid the price. In the Spring of 2021 , the fans flocked back to the ballpark and the Astros got a deferred dose of what they richly deserved.   This report  claims they were hurt by taunting fans. Noynoy Aquino was also hurt when some of the press did not kiss his feet.
Wednesday morning our time, the Astros went into the night quietly. Losing 7-0 in Game 6. In front of their home fans, The last time a World Series winner clinched at home was the 2013 Boston Red Sox. You can hear the collective “good” coming out of people who hate cheaters who were caught red handed and have yet to show an ounce of contrition .
Speaking of people who were fired, impeached and not showing a scintilla of humility, I bring up everybody’s favorite    whipping boy: Andres “Andy” Bautista. The facts and my takes of the former COMELEC head you can find here.
In 2016, Leni Robredo based on a vote tally produced by Smartmatic machines became the VP. A result that has since been questioned.  In 2017, the Houston Astros won the World Series , a result that has since been questioned. Those two separate incidents have something in common. They still reverberate as of this day. You can also throw in the hubris evident in both camps. The Houston Astros players never once apologized to fans of baseball, The Los Angeles Dodgers ( who were denied their first World Series in 29 years) and their bosses who lost their jobs.
Andy Bautista was impeached and then he disappeared . There is a recent warrant out for his arrest.  In the wake of his disappearance , I have not heard one yellow/ pink condemn him. Yet they are the same people who would seem to benefit from the alleged election data privacy breach. Wouldn’t they also want him brought to justice so they can prove their innocence? Unless such a revelation would just ” complicate ” things. Leni resents the FVP tag but yet is entirely mum on anything Andy Bautista related. The yellows ( who now call themselves pink) want you to believe Leni was legally elected. I find that hard to believe considering being associated with Leni in the 2019 election was the kiss of death.
In the two separate realms of Major League Baseball and Pinoy politics, we are experiencing a confluence of a backlash of deception. The Houston Astros stole signs and unofficially innovated baseball with technology all the way to a World Series they did not deserve. The once mighty Liberal Party only four  months removed from the death of their ideal president is a non factor in the current campaign. They are instead scurrying with color changes, rebranding, inflated motorcades, attempted disqualification bids on a 26 year old case.  I don’t know about you but only Astros fans want to see a baseball team rewarded for cheating.  The elections in May are about much more than baseball. There are forces that create motorcades that don’t care there was cheating in 2016. That is exactly why Andy Bautista is nowhere to be found and none of the pinks care to whip him out of hiding.",Others
President Rodrigo Duterte as Vice President in 2022? Only Filipinos hold the RIGHT to decide!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/president-rodrigo-duterte-as-vice-president-in-2022-only-filipinos-hold-the-right-to-decide/,"Early this year, I was one of the first to float the idea of a Duterte-Duterte tandem in the 2022 elections, with Davao City Mayor Sara “Inday Sara” Duterte-Carpio as candidate for president and her father, incumbent President Rodrigo “Digong” Duterte, as candidate for vice president. My reason for doing so is for continuity in the programs, policies and projects that were started by Digong. This can only happen if the next president belongs to his inner circle or his closest political ally, and his daughter, Inday Sara, is the best and most qualified person to assure us that. At the same time, a “Leni Robredo situation,” — one where the vice president is more of an obstructionist and opportunist who causes unnecessary disruptions to government programs, policies and projects, and shamelessly smears on the image of government and the country before a local and foreign audience — should not happen again, thus the idea of having Digong becoming vice president after serving as president for six years.
What was a mere idea of Digong running for vice president months ago is now slowly turning into a real possibility. The recent Pulse Asia survey showed Digong as the most preferred possible for vice president in the 2022 elections. He has a somewhat comfortable lead over the person who ranked second, Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso.
So far, Digong has been sending mixed and often not so serious messages regarding the possibility of him running for vice president. Much earlier, he said that he would not seek the vice presidency if his Inday Sara would run for presidency. Nowadays, he seemed to be trolling everybody by saying that he is considering the idea of running for vice president, with his most recent statement, delivered during the National Assembly of his party, PDP-Laban, at Clark, Pampanga last July 17, 2021 where he suggested that he would run for vice president in 2022 “because of the constitutional immunity from suit that accompanies the position, no thanks to persistent threat of lawsuits to filed against him by the likes of Antonio Trillanes IV and Antonio Carpio.”
The idea of Digong running for vice president has, for some weird reason, shaken the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, which still claims to have a monopoly over national political and intellectual discourse, and the decision-making process over the political and economic destiny of the country. The likes of Christian Monsod and Maria Sol Taule said on both traditional and non-traditional mainstream media outlets that Digong “is not allowed” to run for vice president because, according to them, 1987 Constitution prohibits the president for running for re-election. They see a president running for vice president as a form of “re-election” because the vice president can succeed the president in case of the latter dies or becomes incapacitated. Other members of the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media, having ran out of other valid reasons, were saying that Digong should not run for vice president in 2022 “out of delicadeza” because “he mismanaged the Philippines as president.” Obviously, members of the elite in the capital are already overreacting to something that has not yet happened simply because some people floated the idea of Digong running for vice president and Digong sending mixed, or, should I say, trolling messages flirting with the idea.
But then again, is Digong really qualified to run for vice president in 2022 when his six-year term as president ends?
Section 4, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution states that:
“The President shall not be eligible for any re-electon.”
What does “re-election” mean? Dictionary.com defines “re-election” as:
“The election of a person or persons for a further term of office.”
Is an incumbent president running for vice president when his term of office ends a form of “re-election?” Even a grade school-level child would say no because the positions of president and vice president are not the same. A person who seeks re-election wants a further term of office for the same elected office. This is not possible in the case of the President because Section 4, Article VII of 1987 Constitution explicitly states that the incumbent cannot run for re-election when his single six-year term ends, which makes the assertion of Monsod and Taule partially correct.
However, the 1987 Constitution did not explicitly prohibit the incumbent president from seeking a lower elective post such as that of vice president, senator, congressman, governor, vice governor, provincial board member, mayor, vice mayor, city or municipal councilor, barangay captain and barangay kagawad. There are precedents to this prior to the hullabaloo created by members of the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, and mainstream media when the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022 was floated.
When Joseph “Erap” Estrada was deposed from power as president in 2001, he ran again for president in 2010. He claimed that he could run again for president because “he was not able to finish” his six-year term as president, which was supposed to end in 2004. He ranked second behind eventual winner Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino, III and even performed better than early frontrunner and his erstwhile ally Manny Villar. In 2013, after making a highly publicized decision to switch voter registration and residence from San Juan to Manila, he ran for Mayor of Manila, challenging and eventually winning against then incumbent Mayor Alfredo Lim. Erap served as Mayor of Manila for six years from 2013 to 2019.
At the conclusion of her full six-year term as President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ran for and won the House seat for her home province of Pampanga. PGMA served as Pampanga congresswoman for nine years, most of which she spent under hospital and house arrest due to trumped up charges filed against her by Noynoy’s administration, all of which were eventually dismissed by the courts. On her final three-year term as congresswoman, she was elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives, replacing Davao del Norte Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez and with her leading the chamber in passing key pieces of legislation that were in line with the legislative agenda of the Duterte administration.
When Erap and PGMA decided to seek lower elective posts upon the conclusion of the respective terms of office as President of the Philippines, did we hear anything from the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media? The answer is none. There was nothing but silence from them at both instances.
So why are the Manila political, economic and intellectual elite, as well as the mainstream media afraid of the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022? Are they fearful of the possibility of him winning as vice president, as how the recent Pulse Asia survey results would suggest? Are they afraid of the possibility of two Dutertes- Inday Sara as President and Digong as Vice President- holding the top two political positions of the land, as suggested also by the latest Pulse Asia preferred president and vice president candidates surveys?
Clearly, there is no legal impediment for Digong to run for vice president, senator, congressman, governor, vice governor, provincial board member, mayor, vice mayor, city or municipal councilor, barangay captain and barangay kagawad when his term as president ends. As a lawyer and former prosecutor, he knows the provisions stated by the 1987 Constitution, which is why everything is going to be legal should he decide to seek the vice president post next year. If he decides to run and eventually wins as vice president during the 2022 elections and, one way or another, becomes president on the basis of line of succession, as stated on Section 8, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, that should not be taken against him. Responsibility for that loophole falls upon Corazon “Cory” Aquino’s handpicked framers of the 1987 Constitution, including the ever-so-noisy Christian Monsod. They evidently lacked foresight and applied a reactionary nature to drafting it being driven by a paranoid-schizophrenic fear of a repeat of the events that happened during the time of President Ferdinand Marcos.
I should say let Digong run for vice president in 2022 if he really wants to run during next year’s election. At the end of the day, it will be the Filipino people who would decide if they want him to become vice president after serving as president for six years. The only ones who make a fuss out of the idea of Digong running for vice president in 2022 are those who are aware of the fact that the majority of Filipinos does not like them anymore and, just like in 2016 and 2019, they are going to end up being flushed down the drain once again.",Others
Long-overdue campaign financing laws and system change needed to make democracy work FOR Filipinos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/long-overdue-campaign-financing-laws-and-system-change-needed-to-make-democracy-work-for-filipinos/,"Former Ambassador and Manila Times columnist writes in his piece “For the funds of it” today about “one of the main reasons – other than megalomania – why so many seem to want to run for Philippine electoral posts, even for national posts.” For the most part, Tiglao points out, “It’s an income-generating project.” The inference to the Ping Lacson – Tito Sotto tandem is there for everyone to read.
The phrase describes the strange phenomenon in Philippine elections in which candidates, except for the very rich, end up richer after an election, whether they win or lose.
The practice has been institutionalized for the longest time. It may have been prevalent in past Presidential contests where there was a high element of political instability but this time around, with an Opposition in its death throes, what would the public’s alternative be if there was no Lacson-Sotto to put up a challenge against the administration? It’s no secret that politics is a lucrative “profession” in the country. This is specially true at the local level among Governors, Mayors and Congressmen. Political contributions are invested in legitimate businesses which provides employment and tax revenues for the government. Ask any elected official and this is their usual defense against allegations of corruption.
Running for the two highest posts in the land is not easy during normal times. It is more difficult now in the middle of the pandemic. The incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo refuses to admit the fact that she has no financial backing for a Presidential campaign because of her image problem even if her survey numbers are higher than Lacson’s. This is the essence of democracy; the freedom to choose in a manner where the people make their choices known through the ballot. In comparison, a federal parliamentary system is less expensive for the candidate and the public. Why? A Prime Minister can be voted out of office for loss of confidence. Continuity can also be ensured and lawmaking an easier process because Cabinet Ministers are also members of parliament. The 1987 Constitution is but the justification for the continuing existence of oligarchs and corruption in government, if you think about it. How much do taxpayers spend annually for the Senate and the House of Representatives? A system consisting of regional parliaments and a single national parliament is cheaper, more effective, and allows the direct participation of constituents.
It is crucial for the public to have a choice in the 2022 election. The people are wary of the Opposition’s intransigent attitude towards the administration. There are those in the Opposition who would vote for a viable alternative. There are also those who are disaffected with the administration. This can’t be denied. Each individual has an opinion. This is the basic principle of a democracy no matter how flawed. But there is definitely room for improvement. Hopefully once the Lacson-Sotto tandem makes public their platform, federalism and charter change find their place in it. Lacson’s Budget Reform for Village Empowerment Bill (BRAVE) actually makes development funds available for the provinces down to the barangay level that are not subject to the control of the national government. This prevents the politicization of the release of funds from the national budget which is traditionally under the control of the Executive and the Congressmen by way of the Internal Revenue Allotment and the pork barrel. It is a budget reform measure aimed at minimizing corruption and ensuring funds are spent for the benefit of the constituents.
The more stringent reform measure to prevent politicians from running “for the funds of it” as the former Ambassador puts it, is the enactment of a campaign finance law which would allow the public to contribute to candidates campaigns directly. Current campaign finance provisions in the Omnibus Election Code are a joke. Every Juan knows that campaign spending reports are doctored to comply with the law. Delay in submission means disqualification but look at what happened in 2016 when then Comelec Chair Andy Bautista granted the Liberal Party an “extension” to prevent disqualification. This is not provided for under the Omnibus Election Code and then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez filed suit against the Comelec but nothing came out of it anymore. Maybe we are really better off under an authoritarian government but while we are in a democracy, there is no other choice but to be politically pragmatic.",Others
Communists like @TonyoCruz and their fronts like @IBONFoundation push AYUDA nga-nga culture,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/communists-like-tonyocruz-and-their-fronts-like-ibonfoundation-push-ayuda-nga-nga-culture/,"Where is the substance in the drivel Ka Tonyo Cruz writes? Numbers he cited in his Manila Bulletin piece “P10,000 aid for all is needed — and possible” comes from none other than his comrade IBON Foundation Executive Director Sonny Africa. That biased “source” makes everything he writes suspect from the very beginning. Predictably he writes…
Only in the Philippines is there a pushback against aid. Not a few have claimed we don’t deserve aid, especially the poor who are routinely blamed for being poor. Some of those who are vehemently opposed to aid are the persons who show a certain level of entitlement that can only be satisfied by the continued work of the poor and the lower middle class:  Having food delivered to them whenever they please; have public markets, groceries, gas stations, banks, and other essential services kept open; a steady food supply; and medical services, of course.
The think-tank Ibon Foundation has taken a look at the facts and figures, and they have calculated that Filipinos deserve to demand and to receive aid.
Tonyo displays a glaring lack of a basic grasp of economics and public finance. The fact is, any revenue shortfall of the government is financed by borrowings; external and internal. The ideal is to have a balanced budget. Government is not a business that’s run for profit. It’s easy for Tonyo to say the monies are there without taking into account the budget deficit, debt service and funding extraordinary contingencies arising from fortuitous events such as the projected COVID-19 Delta variant surge.
Even more laughable, Ka Tonyo deigns to compare the Philippines with the US which is a rich country and has the dollar as fiat currency. Has he looked at the current US budget deficit? The inflationary pressure tax-and-spend is putting on the US economy? Is he even aware of Philippine banks’ real estate exposure? If the economy is locked down again and there’s an increase in the non-performing loans (NPLs) of the banks, where will the government get the funds to prevent them from failing?
Managing an economy is not as simple as Tonyo thinks it to be. This is why he and his comrades are not good for anything beyond agitating and exploiting the poor. The mendicant culture they promote is not an option in the pandemic environment. Every Filipino has to do his part. Tonyo’s attitude is typical of leftist-militants. They have no idea what their ideology is. Is it liberal capitalism with safety nets or is it socialism with even bigger safety nets?
As it is, the poor are already benefiting from free education from primary to tertiary levels. The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has spent the highest amount on social services compared to previous administrations. It is easy for Tonyo and his cohorts to demand. But where to get to pay for what they want they are silent on. How convenient. How typically traditional opposition.",Others
Is the Philippine national debt even an issue?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/02/is-the-philippine-national-debt-even-an-issue/,"The campaign period of the 2022 Philippine general elections has officially started. Various executive and legislative positions from national to local posts are up for grabs, where the main candidates have their eyes locked on Malacañang. Political parties and politicians propose various policies that they wish to pursue, provided that they win the elections. Most, if not all of their platforms, cover portions about current Philippine economic issues. One of those perennial economic topics that they raise is about addressing the national debt of the country. Probably, many would still vividly remember when one of the presidential aspirants roughly a couple of decades ago publicly announced his intent to shoulder the tremendous national debt. Whether that disqualified candidate had the means to do such or not, the word “debt” definitely reverberates with numerous Filipinos. It has always been an effective attention-grabbing device, not only in the realm of Philippine politics, but all around the world.
First and foremost, there should be a solid understanding of how a government handles revenue, especially that government-related actions would always entail money. To simplify things, taxes that the regular Filipino pays are utilized to fund various government services. These would include, but are not limited to paying the salaries of civil servants, constructing new infrastructure projects, and maintaining basic services. If government spending is lower than government revenue, a budget surplus is generated which can be realigned for the next fiscal year. However, if government expenditure is larger than the apportioned budget, a budget deficit is incurred. If these deficits are carried over a particular period of time, debt is created through deficit spending.
With the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous countries changed gears in approaching this fiscal malaise. Supply chains were greatly disturbed, employment opportunities suddenly vanished, and the numbers of unemployment-related benefit claimants rose to record levels. In the Global North, a double-faceted approach was undertaken, where governments tweaked their fiscal policy, while central banks adjusted their monetary policy. With a pre-determined interest rate, government bonds were being issued to spur spending and consumption. On the other hand, central banks went with quantitative easing, a tactic that they leaned on during the 2008 Lehman Brothers financial crisis. Basically, the money-printing machine was turned on vigorously, in the hopes that an increased money supply will foster business creation and generation of employment opportunities.
However, this Keynesian approach has its own limits. Since money also follows the law of supply and demand, greatly increasing the money supply led to inflation rates surging beyond 2%, which is a number that these central banks have targeted for many years. With a relatively high inflation rate, labor costs also skyrocketed, hurting these small and medium enterprises and made retaining employees far more difficult. A number of economists are also worried that this global trend might end up turning from bad to worse, unless a drastic policy shift is observed from these governments and their respective central banks.
In the case of the Philippines, the current administration went with deficit spending by borrowing money to finance government expenditures as COVID-19 rampaged across the archipelago. The Philippine government needed to procure various medical supplies, which would include disinfectants, medicines, ventilators, freezers, and vaccines. In addition, financial assistance and distribution of basic necessities were also extended to millions of Filipinos. Furthermore, borrowed money also entails a specified interest rate that should also be repaid in the future. All of these do not come without a price tag, and the next administration will be confronted with the challenge of finding ways to keep the Philippine economy moving despite the nearly depleted financial resources. A financially prudent approach towards government expenses might provide the key to better navigate this tricky situation, while taking advantage of a rebounding economy.
To steer the nation towards continuous economic growth, the government can adopt a fiscal policy that could be adjusted according to the needs of the people. However, there might be a possibility that the country might have to impose certain austerity measures in the near future, most specially if the money well is running dry. These would either involve increasing tax revenue, adopting cost-cutting policies, or a mixture of both. Tax revenue can be increased by raising tax rates and/or by implementing a better tax collecting system, where tax evaders would be penalized. Raising tax rates however would be a highly unpopular move, as it can hamper consumption of goods and services. Cost-cutting policies basically means shrinking or restructuring of government services. In other countries, this would include slashing pension and health insurance benefits, putting a serious strain on living standards. All of these were observed when Greece attempted to address its financial failures during its fiscal crisis.
However, it should be considered that one of the better indicators of a country’s economic health is its debt-to-GDP ratio. A number of economists point out that a ratio of less than 100% of the gross domestic product is ideal, so as not to overwhelm the country with an increasingly unmanageable debt. Foreign investors also look at this indicator to assess if it is economically and financially sound to invest in a certain market or not, even though credit ratings issued by the likes of Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch are being primarily taken in to consideration. These credit ratings provide a measure on a country’s capability to meet its financial obligations, and an indicator to assess investment risk.
People generally think that incurring debt is something that should be both avoided and feared, most specially if there are limited means to repay them. However, in a larger setting like nation-states or probably even multinational companies, welcoming debt as a means to better position the country must be the mindset. Using these credits to invest in areas of the economy that leads to greater productivity is of utmost importance. These sectors would include education, infrastructure, and research and development, because the return on investments in the aforementioned areas is both all-encompassing and creates a more effective and efficient economy. A businessman-like train of thought in the government as a financier and a provider of services should never be frowned upon in this highly capitalistic world.
To create inclusive economic institutions in the Philippines, promoting foreign direct investments is a no-brainer. Lowering barriers to trade, liberalizing the markets, and embracing competition would create many winners for the country. Cooperation with private companies in highly promising strategic sectors would contribute to building a more productive economy. Debt and credit should be seen less as an obligation or as a risk, but more as an opportunity to undergo metamorphic structural changes and escape inter-generational poverty once and for all.",Others
Reform of the Ph’s corrupt bureaucracy only possible if 1987 Charter is JUNKED,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/reform-of-the-phs-corrupt-bureaucracy-only-possible-if-1987-charter-is-junked/,"In his Inquirer piece “Behind the durability of institutions”, Randy David speaks of public institutions which withstand the revolving door of leaders who come and go every Presidential election cycle. These are the constitutional offices with a fixed term, regardless of whoever is in power or the highest career bureaucrat in any department or agency of government. Governments are similar to private corporations in this respect. When a new CEO takes over, he usually brings with him his own team. There is the accompanying politics and power plays within the organization. It’s part of how the game is played.
Other countries have stronger institutions simply because of control mechanisms designed to isolate the administrator from politics. The other side of the coin is when the administrator uses the institution to work against the the government. Examples would be the Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the Vice-President. These institutions do the public a disservice because they perform their mandate in a manner which is detrimental to government. Witness how they have worked against not only the Chief Executive but also the public they are supposed to serve. The civil service code was supposed to be the guide for bureaucrats.
In earlier times, only the best and brightest joined government. Low ranking positions were handed out as political largesse. The higher positions were reserved for those who were at least qualified. The same standards were held for those running for elective office. But the truth is, the dynamics would vary between the national and the local level. Patronage politics, influence-peddling and power brokers are all part of politics anywhere in the world. It is the level which varies.
Nonetheless, David criticizes President Rodrigo Duterte again in this piece.
In the remaining one year of the Duterte presidency, we will be witnessing the quiet departure from public office of some of those who had joined this administration and shamelessly allowed themselves to be used to buttress the powers and burnish the image of an unworthy leader. Some of them may be appointed ambassadors or justices, or rewarded with sinecures in government corporations. Others may simply retire from public life.
The truth is, the bureaucracy is defective. Local chief executives get a pass when they don’t perform because critics would prefer to lay the blame at the feet of the President because it is convenient. The media play and mileage is better. Social media has made it possible to immediately measure public sentiment on issues raised. The Opposition tends to confuse viral posts with election victory. There is no causal relationship to begin with. It is not guaranteed. It thus raises the question, why does the system work better in other countries?
It’s really simple. Government offices at the national level can be manned by anyone who is qualified but regional and local offices should be manned by those who are actually from the constituencies. The pandemic has exposed the development imbalance between Luzon against Visayas and Mindanao. If there was balanced development then the economic recession wouldn’t have been as severe as it has been. This imbalance should be corrected moving forward if the mindset will finally be that the pandemic is endemic. It won’t happen with one fingers’ snap but steps should be taken to make it a reality.
It is actually painful to see that challengers to the administration continue to use old obsolete tactics applied to winning votes. The incumbent Vice-President Leni Robredo has been at it for five years even if her efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The other candidates are making the same mistake. What these politicians miss out on is the fact that public opinion is now very dynamic because of the easy access to information. In 2019, the Opposition candidates lost. They didn’t change their strategy. This didn’t improve their prospects for 2022. You don’t solve a problem by throwing money at it.
The structure is also important and the same goes for the institutions created by the structure. The Budget Reform for Village Empowerment (BRAVE) Bill authored by Sen. Panfilo Lacson allocates development funds for provinces, cities/municipalities and barangays. It basically bypasses the control of the Congressmen and the Executive Branch in the disbursement of funds to the local level. It has a noble purpose but the challenge lies in getting it passed into law. The oversight function is also very bureaucratic because it is at the national level. Regional development has a better chance of success if the review and decision-making process is at the same level.
This is why the reform of the political structure should be an election issue. The 16 million voters of President Duterte in 2016 pinned some of their hopes on the promise of federalism. Nene Pimentel had the same in mind when the Local Government Code was drafted. We have seen how the law is still largely ineffective. The BRAVE Bill of Sen. Lacson is also a step in the right direction but it still falls short of what is actually needed to achieve the goal.
Leave it to Opposition stalwarts like Randy David to see the problem but not propose any solution. This is because they don’t want to touch their precious 1987 Constitution even if it is obvious that it has been the root of our political and social problems since it was passed. It’s about time that this is acknowledged and addressed.",Others
In these times of pandemic Filipinos need a UNIFYING Opposition rather than a divisive one,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/in-these-times-of-pandemic-filipinos-need-a-unifying-opposition-rather-than-a-divisive-one/,"The Delta variant just dashed the hope that a global economic recovery would begin two years into the pandemic. While most of the opinions expressed have been about pandemic response, both good and bad, the no one has dared to point out the elephant in the room that is the only clear path to putting an end to the pandemic; increased vaccine supplies. Viruses mutate continuously while circulating. That is  a fact. Yet rich countries continue to prioritize their own population for vaccination. This year we have seen how COVID-19 has ravaged South America, Brazil and Peru, in particular in that region. India has suffered worse than Brazil with record cases and deaths.
The same is being replicated now in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Indonesia, which is passing India’s numbers. Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar, are all enforcing lockdowns in a bid to contain the spread of Delta. But this is hard to do considering this variant is 1,260 times more contagious and has a shorted incubation period. The first community transmission was confirmed in the country on Thursday evening. Just as everyone thought it was safe to reopen, it is not again.
Filipinos have been grappling with uncertainty since the Luzon lockdown took effect. That prevented a heavy first wave but complacency caught up in March when cases spiked fueled by the UK variant. Healthcare capacity was strained but not to the point that people were dying on the streets. It was nowhere near the catastrophe that befell India and, now, Indonesia. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) still does not have a uniform contact-tracing system in place. There is no adherence to the 3Ts; test trace and treat. By the time the surge was contained in NCR+, another spike began in the regions. New cases haven’t fallen below 3,000 on a daily basis since March.
While the government has passed key legislation charting the path to economic recovery, the mindset is still that COVID-19 can be beaten. Unfortunately, this will not happen while majority of the global population remains unvaccinated. The virus will continue to mutate. Rich countries cornered vaccine supplies last year after the pharmaceutical companies announced a breakthrough in vaccine development. The equitable distribution of vaccines under the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) Covax facility largely went for naught because supply was short. The rich countries stockpiled vaccines good for three times their populations. It was inevitable that we would come to this point again.
Singapore has been more pragmatic in its approach. Their mindset is now Covid is endemic. The government is taking measures for its citizens and the economy to transition to the new normal. The Philippines should do the same. Our work is cut out for us because the government has no digitization plan in place. Connectivity is an issue even in the National Capital Region and its outskirts (NCR+). What more in the regions?
For economic recovery to begin, there is the need for disruptive reforms in both the public and private sector. The Luzon lockdown put in focus the underdevelopment of the regions. This makes the 2022 election crucial because clear platforms of action need to be presented by candidates running for office. The economy, education and public health are the main issues the public deems as having the highest impact in their daily lives since the pandemic began.
The Opposition is constantly haranguing the government for social amelioration and stimulus when it is hard-pressed to increase revenue collection in the midst of the recession caused by the pandemic. Infrastructure development is better because it generates employment and economic activities. The so-called economic experts just want to agitate the poor so they can win them over their side in time for the election.
The Delta variant is a serious threat not only to the economy but also the citizenry. It falls upon us to take the necessary precautions. We should be united as a nation in facing the challenges posed by the pandemic and finding solutions. Divisiveness will not get us anywhere. The President has been appealing for unity since he won in 2016. This has fallen on the deaf ears of the Opposition. Think about it. Why would they still hold protest rallies on Monday when the President delivers his final State of the Nation Address (SONA) given the health risks?
The public should realize that divisions only serve to worsen the situation. Instead of criticisms, it’s best if out-of-the-box solutions are proposed instead. This is the only way to move forward and minimize the element of uncertainty that each and every Filipino is dealing with at present.",Others
Answering the threats of natural calamities in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/answering-the-threats-of-natural-calamities-in-the-philippines/,"Roughly one month has passed since Typhoon Odette devastated various regions of the Philippines, specifically the Visayas islands. Houses, bridges, and harbors were left in ruins, while trees and electrical posts were uprooted. Lifeline accessibility was greatly hampered, with access to electricity and safe drinking water returning only after two days or more. With this tropical typhoon’s strength and wind velocity, a number of Filipinos recalled the horrors of Typhoon Yolanda, which literally left thousands of lifeless bodies scattered across Eastern Visayas. Specialists would mention that Typhoon Odette had the potential to wreak havoc in a similar degree to how Typhoon Yolanda rampaged the islands a decade ago, but damage caused by this typhoon were somehow ameliorated due to the current administration’s preparations when it came to information dissemination and relief operations.
Geography and geology heavily dealt the Philippines a deadly pair of cards. The first card refers to the country’s location in the Pacific Ring of Fire. Numerous dormant and active volcanoes dot the whole archipelago. Below them lie tectonic plates that continuously move, where the released energy in the form of earthquakes causes the ground to shake and in turn, destroy human settlements since time immemorial. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes had, as such, been a recurring part of Philippine history. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and the Baguio Earthquake in 1990 headlined international news. The other card the Philippines was dealt with is about these tropical storms and typhoons, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to be exacerbated by climate change in the following years.
Numerous environmentalists and internationalists quickly point out that the Philippines should actively participate in global efforts in pursuing climate justice, specially considering that the whole archipelago is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Calling on the Global North or these First World countries to shoulder the financial burden of developing environmentally-friendly technologies in the name of climate justice should not dissuade Philippine policymakers about the facts on the ground. Reality presents to us that self-help is something that the Philippines can only rely on. It is really only Filipinos who are in a position to help themselves. Fortunately Japan, a country in the Global North, can provide us an approach that the Philippines could emulate in pursuing disaster resiliency.
Known as the Land of the Rising Sun, the Japanese Islands were also dealt cards similar to that of the Philippines. An archipelagic country in the Pacific that has its own share of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis surely created this hardened nation. In addition, absence of natural resources like petroleum and minerals makes the game of survival harsher for the Japanese. The mountainous terrain of the islands also creates an agricultural environment unsuitable to feeding more than 125 million mouths. This triple whammy forced the Japanese civilization to engineer durable institutions paired with strategic policies to mitigate these geographical limitations. What portions of the Japanese society should the Philippines learn and accept, so as to substantially reduce these geographical risks associated with natural disasters?
First is to strengthen, sharpen, and modernize the Philippine armed forces to ensure they would be properly maintained and can be deployed rapidly. Even though the American-imposed pacifist constitution constrains their current military capabilities, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces or the JSDF actively participates in times of national crises. Flash floods and avalanches happen annually in Japan, so these uniformed personnel are called upon for search and rescue operations. In addition, the JSDF have helicopter carriers, which can be refurbished to house numerous fighter planes. Even though aircraft carriers have been recently turned into weapons of military power projection, these types of naval and aerial assets are used depending on the country’s needs. A Philippine helicopter carrier deployed between the islands would definitely save numerous lives during disaster situations.
Second is to regularly conduct topographical studies, because a country’s geological make-up changes with time and plays a significant role in determining an area’s vulnerability when a natural calamity strikes. Unfortunately for the Philippines, numerous government and private agencies are still using Marcos-era maps and data, which have already far outlived their purpose. Updated hazard maps can recalibrate the government’s priorities in acting when a disaster happens. These types of maps can be obtained through the local offices and may help direct one’s actions when evacuation orders are issued.
Third is to continuously invest in infrastructure programs. The durability and accessibility of roads, bridges, and air strips always serve as the starting point of relief operations. These man-made structures should be robustly-designed and maintained properly so as not to degrade with natural wear-and-tear. These infrastructure programs should also include reliable, consistent, and stable lines of communication. With this, government-issued calamity warnings would be easily disseminated to the populace, most especially when it comes to earthquakes since quick yet rational human actions mean life or death consequences. In Japan, they have created a complex warning system that connects various seismometers and computers and detects an earthquake a few moments before it strikes. This technology has arguably saved thousands, if not millions of lives.
Finally, decentralizing government powers may indirectly assist in answering these natural calamities. This is in considering the fact that each province and region in the Philippines faces different environmental challenges in varying degrees. East Visayas and Bicolandia are typhoon-prone regions, while the Davao region has had its recent share of earthquakes. Other regions like the Cagayan Valley have experienced flash floods, while Calabarzon struggled with Mt. Taal’s volcanic activity. With limited resources, a federal or a semi-federal Philippines would allow local governments to wisely allot scarce resources, in accordance to the specific threats that they face. Unfortunately for Japan, it is a unitary government where directives begin and end with Tokyo and local government leaders have limited abilities. This can be noticed when even prefectural governors seek the Prime Minister’s permission to declare a state of emergency, which has paralyzed government action to a certain degree.
These points raised may not be readily adoptable, but nevertheless, may provide ideas as to what kinds of thorough calamity responses should be constructed by the government. Needless to say, financing a sound policy requires deep pockets. That is why it is imperative to liberalize the economy by opening up the country to foreign direct investments, which entails a reformed Philippine constitution. Through these investments that generate employment, the country’s coffers would be fattened, thus possessing the capacity to create a more disaster resilient Philippines.",Others
Three highly influential appointments of the incoming Marcos Jr. administration,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/three-highly-influential-appointments-of-the-incoming-marcos-jr-administration/,"The Uniteam ticket of the Marcos-Duterte tandem cruised to power when they successfully won their respective positions astoundingly. This unprecedented moment is historical in a sense that they’ve gained a supermajority that gives the incoming administration a powerful mandate not only to continue the gains of the outgoing Duterte presidency but also to materialize their campaign platforms. Unlike most liberal democracies of the West or Western-oriented countries, the Philippine president serves both as a head of government and as a head of state. These roles compel the president to wear many hats with finesse, as he has tough responsibilities to shoulder. As stated by the current constitution, these responsibilities are coupled with immense powers that are checked and balanced by the legislature and the judiciary.
As the country’s chief executive, the president is accorded the power to nominate for appointment various individuals to different positions in the government, with an expectation that they would perform to the best of their capabilities to promote and protect the nation’s interests. The power of appointment is checked by a bicameral body called as the Commission on Appointments, which can confirm or reject these presidential appointees. Even though the culture of “padrino” politics in the Philippines has derailed technocracy, reviewing Marcos Jr.’s platforms can provide us with ideas as to what government positions would be the most critical for the incoming administration.
During the campaign period, Marcos Jr. has named a number of problems that he wishes to address during his administration. Knowing how the country was battered by various challenges, he has explained in his interviews that he would seriously tackle economic hardships, foreign relations, and security issues. From there, we can predict which appointments would be the most impactful and influential for the Marcos Jr. administration to succeed.
In his campaign sorties, the Uniteam presidential candidate was seen adamant in addressing the needs of the economy, specially that the outgoing administration resorted to deficit spending to soften the blows thrown by Covid-19. This pandemic-induced recession slumped economic activities causing unemployment and financial insecurity in various sectors of the economy. Even though the Philippines is seen to be rebounding due to the Duterte administration’s policies in addressing Covid-19, threats to economic growth are still looming large. Market volatility brought about by the Ukrainian crisis has caused an increase in the prices of basic commodities ranging from wheat products to petroleum. Furthermore, this is exacerbated by China’s draconian zero-Covid policy which continuously disrupts global supply chains. Inflation is just around the corner.
With his desire to jumpstart the Philippine economy, many analysts may point to the finance secretary as Marcos Jr.’s economic key person. However, I beg to disagree because it was the durable Philippine peso that basically kept the country afloat. With this reasoning, the incoming governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is of utter importance. As the Philippine peso’s issuing body, the BSP has the levers of monetary policy under its command. If the BSP wishes to address unemployment by promoting job growth, it can lower interest rates, which makes money lending easier. But if the BSP desires to temper inflation by toning down price increases, it can raise interest rates that makes borrowing money more difficult. This delicate balancing act is the primary responsibility of the BSP. With a stable and predictable currency as a basic tenet for economic growth, the government through its finance department must enact a fiscal policy that jibes reasonably well with BSP’s levers. Appointing a finance secretary possessing valuable experience in the BSP is a stroke driven to the correct direction, but economic success lies in a perfectly executed monetary policy.
After baring his economic plans during the campaign period, Marcos Jr. was also asked about his viewpoints regarding international relations. Aside from the heating US-China strategic competition, which definitely puts the Philippines in the middle of such confrontation, there were also queries about the Ukrainian crisis and the West Philippine Sea. He was quick to denounce the Cold War era mindset of these spheres of influence. He emphasized that the Philippines must take a pragmatic approach lest experience collateral damage that further disadvantages the country. To summarize, he advocates a policy of becoming friends with everyone, and an enemy to no one.
As the incoming chief architect of Philippine foreign policy, the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is another appointee that will mirror how the country will paddle its way in the troubled waters of global politics. The Philippines’ foreign secretary will have competent career diplomats under his or her office who protect, promote, and project the nation’s interests consistent with its three pillars of foreign policy. As the country attempts to improve bilateral ties with various countries through trade, cultural exchange, and cooperation, multilateral avenues for dialogue will also be explored. The top diplomat of the Philippines will certainly navigate geopolitical challenges of the Indo-Pacific region.
Aside from these external challenges imposed by geopolitics on the Philippines, queries regarding national security issues were also raised during the campaign period. Even though the West Philippine Sea is viewed as one of the possible flash points of significant international conflict for this century, finding solutions that confront the threats caused by extremist groups were also discussed. Currently, the Duterte administration has organized a national task force that responds to the dangers of communist insurgency. Out of all the major presidentiables, Marcos Jr. had vocally expressed his support in continuing the efforts of the NTF-ELCAC which has significantly weakened the clout of the Communist Party of the Philippines, its armed group the New People’s Army, and its front organisation the National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF).
Listening to the incoming president’s pursuance to the continued funding of NTF-ELCAC, it can be inferred that the next secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND) will be another critical position for the Marcos Jr. administration. With the president serving as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, his defense secretary will play a critical role in ending communist armed conflict. With the army, navy, and air force undergoing modernization efforts, the secretary will also oversee these programs that would hopefully serve as a capable military deterrent. Finally, the aforementioned DND secretary would also be compelled to mobilize these armed forces when natural calamities occur, or on occasions of national exigencies.
With the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. officially beginning in a few weeks, his appointed officials will slowly surface and solidify before his inauguration. His appointed BSP governor, DFA secretary, and DND secretary will undoubtedly play important roles in his administration. Most, if not all Filipinos, are praying that the Marcos Jr. presidency will create a period of sustained peace and prosperity for the country.",Others
Yellowtard brand of free-for-all “democracy” no longer an election-winning platform,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/yellowtard-brand-of-free-for-all-democracy-no-longer-an-election-winning-platform/,"Joel Ruiz Butuyan asks a question in his Inquirer piece “Two worlds at war” to which he already knows the answer. He just doesn’t want to admit it. Butuyan writes about “the existence of two different worlds in our midst” that the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte supposedly “exposed”. Interestingly though, he highlights an important contribution to the situation he laments by the very partisan camps that profess to champion “democracy” in the Philippines…
One very impactful cause of the dual realities in our midst is the kind of leaders who have caused extreme and longstanding disappointment to many of our countrymen. These leaders have perverted and destroyed our people’s view and experiences with our version of democracy, our brand of economic development, and all the other ideals upon which our people have looked up to for deliverance and salvation. The resulting disillusionment has caused our people to associate democracy with unresponsiveness, intellect with arrogance, and civility with insensitivity.
Indeed, the “restoration” of “democracy” in 1986 led to a free-for-all in anything and everything. This is why we’re in the mess we find ourselves in today. It’s been proven that Western-style democracy does not work in an Asian setting. I have no clue as to when colonial-minded public intellectuals and politicians will finally realize that it simply doesn’t and will not work for Filipinos.
Our ASEAN neighbors overtook us after they gained independence from their colonial masters because they had the advantage of the latter rebuilding what was destroyed during the war. In contrast, the US abandoned the Philippines by granting independence while retaining their bases and giving Japan a free pass with respect to war reparations. It was only during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos that vital infrastructure was built. The advantage then was we had a smaller population. How much has our population grown since 1986 when the Church became a governance partner through its alliance with the Yellows?
This is why it is ironic that certain comebacking Senators are taking potshots at the administration. They were in office before Rodrigo Duterte became President in 2016. What did they do during their tenure is the operative question? Butuyan is the same. Public opinion is divided. There are sectors whose members don’t care about the fatalities of the drug war because they believe it is justified. There are those in the Opposition who profess to believe in the value of human life but are just posturing and virtue-signalling for the sake of it.
The 2022 election is a referendum on what kind of governance the public prefers. Vice President Leni Robredo has harped on what she claims is not the true public sentiment about the support of citizens for the administration. Yet, the Opposition lost in the 2019 midterm election. The Opposition can’t claim they are the silent majority if they continue to lose electoral contests. Vox Populi is the principle at work here. The minority can’t impose its will on the majority. When they will get this is the question without an answer even now with just 10 months to go.",Others
President Rodrigo Duterte’s last State of the Nation Address will be chock full of achievement,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/president-rodrigo-dutertes-last-state-of-the-nation-address-will-be-chock-full-of-achievement/,"The last of President Rodrigo Duterte’s state of the nation addresses (SONAs) is at hand. In his Inquirer column today, Peter Wallace is a bit profuse in his praise of the President. He went on to “preempt his Sona by listing some of the achievements he accomplished, some that previous presidents shied away from, or were unable to accomplish”, and then writes…
But probably one of his greatest and most long-lasting legacies will be the “Build, build, build” program. His government more than doubled the percent of GDP spent on infrastructure and elicited foreign government and private sector support for 112 major projects. An essential if you want business to grow, and people to have communities they can live in.
In my personal experience, on the other hand, the government bureaucracy continues to suck big-time. Digitization is not being adopted by government departments and agencies. Local government units (LGUs) are the same. The resistance from bureaucrats is intense because it threatens their livelihoods. But what I can truly say is the six years of Duterte flew by compared to the agony of waiting for the Aquino administration that preceded his to step down. That was mental torture. What Duterte will say in his last SONA is top of mind among political pundits. This is his valedictory address to Congress and to the Filipino people before the campaign season sets in.
As Wallace points out, there are more reform measures pending before Congress. There is still enough time to get these passed provided our lawmakers don’t fall into the trap of politicking. Their priority is not these measures but the election year budget. August marks the start of the budget season for government departments and agencies. The budgets will be submitted to the House Appropriations Committee for review then the budget hearings will commence. There is incentive for the Congressmen to pass the budget before the end of the year because the campaign period for the local elections begin in March.
There is also the ban on public works spending to be mindful of. The President admitted to not knowing anything about the economy and left it in the hands of someone who does. If it were not for the pandemic, the President would have been able to report gains during his six-year term. As it is, the pandemic put the economy into a recession but Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez has proven to be both adept and pro-active. Congress finally passed amended portions of the tax reform program he put forth at the beginning of the administration. There are still pending measures in Congress which are essential components of the economic recovery program. These should be passed before the administration bows out on June 30, 2022.
By far, the greatest legacy of the Duterte administration is infrastructure development as Wallace highlights. Big-ticket and small-ticket projects alike were completed within six years. Some of these were awarded during the tail end of the Aquino administration. What the Opposition fails to take cognizance of is the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center was only able to get its act together in the last two years of its tenure. What was announced as the flagship program of the Aquino administration turned out to be a dud. The symbol of the failure is the “magpapa-sagasa kami sa tren” remarks made during the speech announcing the LRT-1 extension from Baclaran to Cavite. This was in 2013. By 2016, groundbreaking on the construction hadn’t even begun. The Duterte administration had to twist the arm of the Ayala-MVP joint-venture which was awarded the operations and maintenance contract of LRT-1 to get the project moving. It is finally being built.
There is also the increased government spending on social services. Free tertiary education, universal healthcare and the Malasakit Centers constructed in the regions as well as the upgrade of government-owned hospitals. The upgraded “Build Build Build” (BBB) program now includes the expansion of existing government-owned hospitals and the construction of new hospitals where they are urgently needed as part of the effort to build up healthcare capacity in the midst of the pandemic.
The greatest threat to economic recovery is still the pandemic. The news yesterday that the Delta variant has been detected locally doesn’t bode well for the economy. The government will again be put to a serious test as the rest of the world has been grappling with a Delta-induced surge. This could also have an effect on the conduct of the 2022 election if the situation becomes as worse as it is in countries in the midst of this surge.
Duterte is the only post-Marcos President who has been able to maintain his approval rating from start to finish. Filipinos are generally satisfied with his performance. It wasn’t a perfect administration with not all of the promises being kept but the people felt the change that he promised during the campaign even if he had been hampered by the vilification and black propaganda campaign organized by the Opposition. The Mayor who did not do well academically has finally obtained a passing mark when and where it counted the most. Daghang salamat kaayo Manong.",Others
Century Peak Tests President Duterte’s Resolve on Reclamation Ban,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/century-peak-tests-president-dutertes-resolve-o-reclamation-ban/,"It seems proponents of reclamation projects are out to test President Rodrigo Duterte’s resolve a few weeks after saying he had put a stop to such projects because of corruption.
“You know, itong sa (this) Manila Bay na reclamation, thousands have applied but because of the corruption that I’ve heard early last year, there’s no more processing of papers,” he said in a speech at the Philippine National Police headquarters in Quezon City on Friday, June 25.
“Hininto ko (I stopped it) and it has caused the big companies lots of money,” he added.
Duterte did not elaborate on specific companies or local government units applied to pursue reclamation in the famous Manila landmark. But he implied that some entities were bribing government officials.
“I told you, do not give money to the people in government. If I know you have given even a single centavo, I will throw your application to the waste basket and I have done that and I am doing that every day,” he said.
Source: https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-nixed-manila-bay-reclamation-applications-corruption
Apart from the 174 hectare reclamation project that threatens to destroy the Mindanao Sea, another reclamation project on Manila bay is being pursued with gusto by a mining company.
Sources say that Century Peak (Metals) Holdings Corp. (Century Peak) is ignoring Duterte’s seemingly hard no against reclamation in Manila bay.
Century Peaks reclamation project will occupy 1,330 hectares of the bay, with 1,043 hectares on the Cavite side and 287 hectares on the side of Parañaque City.
The project will affect 178 local government units including Las Pinas, Paranaque, and Cavite.
The Pambansang Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (PAMALAKAYA), a fisherfolk organization, says more than 700 families in Cavite will lose their homes and livelihood from fishing.
It was also claimed that Century Peak’s gargantuan reclamation project will destroy mangrove areas vital no only to the marine ecology in the area but also comprises one of the area’s main defenses against storm surges as well as flooding.
There are fears that it will block the Parañaque River, Las Piñas River, Zapote River at  Molino River. With these natural drains blocked, there are concerns that the resulting floods will damage the homes of more than two million residents of Paranaque, Las Pinas at Bacoor cities.
According to records from the Philippine Stock Exchange, Century Peak’s chairman is Wilfredo Keng. It is the same company suspended by DENR Secretary Gina Lopez in 2016 because of alleged violations in connection with the Rapid City Nickel Project at Casiguran Nickel Project in the Dinagat Islands.
If Keng’s Century Peak manages to break ground for its reclamation project, the Duterte administration’s growing number of detractors as well as political opponents will pounce on this as another instance of flagrant corruption.
The administration is already reeling from corruption allegations in connection with the flagging of the Department of Health and OWWA by the Commission on Audit.",Others
The Sole Reason You Can Never Trust Leni As Far As You Can Throw Drilon,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/the-sole-reason-you-can-never-trust-leni-as-far-as-you-can-throw-drilon/,"I am guessing the bulk of the population already made up their mind who they are for May 2022. Yet that fact is not going to stop nauseating campaigning for all the parties and candidates. It is a fact of Filipino culture which I documented last election.
There is no campaign discussed more the same way Miller Light was discussed in classic beer commercials than the Robredo/ Cuneta Pangalinan campaign.   There are better places in GRP that detail the gulf between reality and illusion.
Before I live up to my click bait title , let’s go through some other reasons why the thought of Leni Robredo as our next president makes many people throw up in their mouth:
Like Noynoy before her, Leni rose to prominence from necropolitics. Nothing like a death in the family to get people to care who you are so you can get votes. The Liberal Party playbook: if they didn’t notice you in life , then point to a dead relative or two. Noynoy had no contributions in the Senate or Congress, Leni had zero contributions in the courtroom. Leni’s camp tries to shake off the unintelligent label by naming honorary degrees and what her kids did. Why can’t they show videos of her making sense? Instead her campaign prefer we see videos of her doing all this.
Leni was responsible for the well being of the Liberal Party. That is past tense because this election there is no Liberal Party. At least in name. To show you how fast things change in politics , the Liberal Party elected a president 12 years ago . In the here and now , that president has become radioactive.   Leni Lovers  tell us the Philippines will be a paradise with her as president.
Therein  lies the rub: she was the most visible member of the Liberal Party and they imploded. She can’t lead the Liberal Party yet she will be effective with the Philippines?? She can’t blame internal politics. There are none now. There was nothing to leave. How can you not hold Leni generally responsible for the Liberal Party falling off a cliff? How is that hollow shell of a party NOT about her leadership, perseverance, competence and resourcefulness?  The fate of that party says a lot about Leni and what she is and is not about. The Liberal party disappeared because nobody there was worth it . Including Leni .
Eight years ago I wrote this piece on the importance of symbols when it comes to national identity. Leni thinks simply changing her color will rid her persona of the stench of the Liberal Party. Noynoy, that complete moron only supported something the Liberal Party had total control of. Using that stupid yellow ribbon for his entire term , he was telling you the country did not matter at all. It is the symbol of the party and the interests of the party that comes before all.  Why do you think neither Noynoy or the Liberal Party stood the test of time? It is entirely comforting that Leni followed that same tactic 12 years later . Shows you why I never liked her. More than a few people agree.
Mar in 2016 dubbed himself Noynoy 2.0.  He even cried when the President endorsed him before the election that year. Weird though how he was so cavalier on the ground in Tacloban during the Yolanda aftermath. He even told CNN’s audience ( there was no CNN Philippines in 2012) that  President Aquino was known as ” Pnoy”. What a stupid thing to have in your head with all the corpses and misery around him.
Leni believes drugs should be decriminalized . Leni believes Manny Pacquaio would make a good president . Leni believes communist supporters should be given a seat at the table when it comes to policy making. Leni believes it is ok to publicize that her daughter was in an alleged sex video that has yet to materialize just so she can blame BBM. Leni believes it is okay to use the Lord’s altar to campaign alongside a non Catholic. Leni believes it is okay to change running mates with a month to go in the election.   Leni believes Auschwitz is a nice place for a photo opportunity. My question to you: Is it okay to believe in a person who believes all that?
Leni can not avoid the Mar Roxas 2.0 stink . They were running mates in 2016 and were on the ballot as “Daang Matuwid”. A name you never hear bandied about today. Maybe because the practitioners proved to be very ineffective so they ditched the name. Anything Noynoy brought to the table since 2009-2016 is as treasured as a soiled condom. The only one who does not see it that way is Kris Aquino. Her brother has been dead almost a year and it’s only now on stage that we find out that there is an unpublished  letter from the grave vouching for Leni’s authenticity .KSP is the root of all evil.
Since 2009 , Noynoy, Mar or Leni force fed you all the Liberal Party rhetoric and symbols and songs. The problem is that in the proceeding 13 years what can we point to from them and their cohorts that materialized from their yellow brainwashing?? The same stagnant signs and slogans but nothing tangible. The same people telling you to vote Leni told you to vote Noynoy. How did that work out?? How is the Liberal party doing?? The boy cried wolf too much. A long time ago San Miguel had a beer called Lager Light which went the way of the tetradactyl. Well the brand went extinct but apparently the exact same beverage changed it’s name to San Miguel Light and is the easiest beer to find in any restaurant in Manila that serves beer. I personally do not think San Mig Light  is a quality beer but it proves that things can be effectively rebranded.   Changing yellow to pink does not solve everything. It doesn’t matter what color you wear , it only matters what you are . Leni believes lightning will strike twice, that this election she will be San Mig Light going from yellow to pink.
Leni of course learned from the best when it comes to necropolitics. Nobody could name one thing Noynoy ever did as a senator or congressman before August 2009. Nobody could name one thing Leni did as a lawyer prior to May 2013 . Leni back in June tipped her toe in the necropolitics pool trying to cash the cash the chips of the clueless one’s death. The house it seems is not honoring those chips and that lead to the disintegration of the Liberal Party.  Noynoy exploited his mother’s timely death. Leni would exploit Noynoy’s death if there was anything to exploit.
I have laid out a plethora of reasons why voting for Leni would be insane. Personally the ultimate reason you can trust Leni as far as you can throw Franklin Drilon is the nonchalant way she looked at the events of August 18 2012. Rico Puno by all accounts was loved and trusted by Noynoy. Fact: He resigned because of a breaking and entering incident at the Manila apartment of Jesse Robredo while his plane was still missing. I doubt any of you relish your home being broken into. I also doubt any of you would enjoy the timing of that break in coinciding with a moment in time your spouse’s life is in doubt. All that is fact.
Just based on the facts , I have simple questions. Others have taken the facts and have their own questions and their own conclusions. GRP’s Ramon Ortoll discussed them here. He also believes Leni to be a train wreck of a politician. Then again what good politician would align themselves with Noynoy?  Manuel “Boy” Mejorada raises his own questions when it comes to the fatal flight that took the life of Leni’s husband. Really worth the 11 minutes .
Even if you disregard the interpretations, the facts open  up a can of worms:  Why the urgency on the part of trusted Noynoy henchman Puno? Did he know something about the plane at that moment that we all did not know? If something was so important , why was it not in a government office instead of a private home? Why did Noynoy not stick up for Puno? The most important question of all: if your husband’s home was immediately violated at an extremely vulnerable time would you trust the person who did the violating? Would you trust the person the boss that person was representing?? Well Leni went on to make that person her boss and was totally obedient to him.
Oxford Dictionary defines vice-president
an official or executive ranking below and deputizing for a president. “
In almost six years as vice president , she did not do her job as if she was ranking below. She looked down on the duly elected president. Leni as a vice president was not loyal to her president. Leni as a presidential candidate was not loyal to her daughter.  Leni as a wife did not seem traumatized by a fatal plane crash and a break and enter on the same day to ask the same questions I did. Her rallies make it a point to exclude the Philippine flag. Leni as candidate for president in the 2022 elections is not even loyal to her running mate. What makes you think she will be loyal to the citizens of that flag??
Epilogue
We all have been exposed to the campaign tactics by Leni fanatics. Many of them Noynoy fans who never saw him as the Emperor with no clothes. Let’s go door to door, let’s belittle those that think differently and let’s disqualify the front runner. Making Leni out to be saint or in the image of the Virgin Mart or whatever. Fabricating sex scandals for the sake of slandering those they envy. I normally will not watch the Netflix show Bridgerton but I found myself paying attention to S02E02 and a quote hit me on the head like a large frying pan being held by Mike Tyson that screamed Leni campaign.
Attempting to influence others as to the correct course of action, well, it is often a trying and irritating endeavor that only brings out the worst in us before we discover it has been fruitless all along.”
It just crystalized my thoughts so eloquently on the campaign of the yellows who are now pink.

"The last State of the Nation Address of a most unorthodox president: Mr. Duterte, take a bow!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-last-state-of-the-nation-address-of-a-most-unorthodox-president-mr-duterte-take-a-bow/,"The President will deliver his State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 26. Various news outlets have began taking the public sentiment on what they want to hear from Rodrigo Duterte when he delivers his valedictory address before Congress. Duterte would’ve “graduated” with honors if not for the pandemic rudely interrupting his term. Pandemic response gets a passing grade because of how relatively bumbling the IATF-EID has performed. Still no unified contact-tracing system and adherence to the 3Ts – test, trace and treat. With the confirmed community transmission of the Delta variant, we again face economic uncertainty because most of the Asia-Pacific region is suffering from a Delta-induced surge.
It remains to be seen how we will weather this latest outbreak. The Delta Variant is more contagious than the original virus and affects both the vaccinated and unvaccinated. With our vaccination rate still low and slow, a surge would appear inevitable. But who knows? Maybe the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) can pull off a hat trick. The economic recovery is high on the list on the President’s speech. Several reform bills are still pending in Congress. The budget season begins in August. It will be an election budget for sure. The Department of Finance is pushing for the passage of the last tranche of the tax reform program. This is one of the biggest achievements of the administration if and when completed. As we have a consumption-driven economy, the recession was felt the most last year but it has picked up this year.
Digitization should be another government priority. The President has mentioned this in his past SONAs. Now it’s imperative that the bureaucracy moves in this direction. Part of the resistance stems from the minimization of corruption that digitization brings. The President should put his foot down on this issue. Next up is connectivity. Digitization needs connectivity to work efficiently. There are new employment opportunities but this requires both reskilling and upskilling. Hitting two birds with one stone can be achieved if only the underlings would put their heads into it. Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is lagging in the digital landscape under Secretary Isidro Lapeña. That’s to be expected because Lapeña is not tech-literate and TESDA’s courses need either updating or upgrading.
It wouldn’t be asking too much for Congress to pass easy amendments to the economic provisions of the Constitution by way of the Public Service Act and the Retail Trade Liberalization bill. There is also that key insertion, “unless otherwise provided for,” which is essential to getting the minor roadblocks for foreign direct investment to be removed. Duterte has been known to meander from the drafted speech and it’s hard to second-guess what he will say in addition but given the pattern he has established, he will definitely have words for the Opposition. He appealed to the Opposition for unity in his first SONA but this didn’t happen. It’s almost a certainty he will take a dig at them for one last time. He may also put an end to speculation on whether or not he is running for the Vice-Presidency. There is no Constitutional prohibition contrary to what the opposition says. He can even ascend to the Presidency because the act would be succession not reelection in the event the new President is “incapacitated” for whatever reason.
Overall, the bad boy hillbilly from Leyte, Cebu and Davao did good. His father could never have imagined Rodrigo becoming President one day. Probably his mother as well. The most unorthodox President the Philippines has ever had bows out from office on June 30, 2022. Duterte not only outdid himself but also his predecessors. The promdi challenged the establishment and came out victorious. The six years went by fast. There was no agony of waiting for the term to end unlike the Aquino administration when the public couldn’t wait for the election to be over. A job well-done under the circumstances Mr. President.

Leni Robredo has FAILURE written all over her face,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/leni-robredo-has-failure-written-all-over-her-face/,"The more critical thinkers among the public have noticed Vice President Leni Robredo’s speech pattern to be mostly incoherent. She can’t organize her thoughts verbally in a manner which she can be understood by her audience. Most wonder why this is considering she is a UP graduate of Economics. Even her grasp of her major isn’t good. Yesterday she went after the Department of Health (DOH) over the adverse findings of the Commission on Audit (COA) by saying “bakit tayo mangungutang kung marami palang pera na hindi nagagastos?”
It’s not as simple as she paints it to be. You can’t compare government borrowing to the operations of a department. She can’t get it in her head that government is not a for-profit entity. It is in the business of delivery of public services. Robredo also took up law at the Ateneo De Naga and from all accounts, it took her either two or three tries to pass the bar. Not indicative of being a good lawyer and it shows. She is hopelessly inarticulate. Figure that out. Being articulate is a basic requirement for one expected to competently argue cases before a court. It is hardly surprising that, most of the time, Robredo does not cite legal provisions in her critique of the administration.
The DOH missive is an example. A seasoned lawyer would normally put it in the context of what laws were violated. But, in her case, it was about public debt. She has been Vice-President for five years. She still has not grown into the job. Her speech pattern is based on non-government organisation (NGO)-speak. Actually, her office is akin to a trading outfit; it serves as a broker of donations from the private sector and NGOs for the poorest of the poor. These are whom she describes as “nasa laylayan ng lipunan,” literally “fringes of society”. Despite all of her efforts and her being in the news cycle 25/8 courtesy of her lamestream media allies, her job approval and trust ratings are still average at best. This can be attributed to the lack of sincerity in her manner of speaking. She does not come across as credible.
It doesn’t help that she affects the colegiala manner, which is something you don’t really expect to see in a woman in her mid-50s who is Vice-President and an economist-lawyer by profession. Most of the projects under her office are PR-oriented. They are not scalable enough to be institutionalized in government agencies. For example, take those vaccine drives that she puts under her personal brand but use the vaccine allocations of the local government units (LGUs). Why the need for such if it is the mandate of the LGUs from the national government to begin with? Post-Marcos, she is the only Vice-President to deliver a contra-SONA which is usually done only by the minority in the Legislature. The Vice-President is part of the Executive branch so what business does she have criticizing the branch of government she belongs to? In this respect, Robredo is not being faithful to the functions of her office as stipulated in the Constitution. She was given a Cabinet post by the President but didn’t buckle down to work which is why she was fired ignominiously. She was given another chance by being appointed head of the inter-agency committee on illegal drugs but she turned it again into a PR-show-cum-crusade against the administration in its drug war.
Robredo also fails at being the titular head of the Opposition. Look at the miserable showing of their Senatorial slate in 2019. Up to today, she still has not made a categorical statement on whether or not she is running for President in 2022. She is making it appear that she does not have the time to focus on making a decision because she’s busy with her so-called pandemic response efforts. Yet she admitted to meeting with Sen. Panfilo Lacson and Senate President Tito Sotto in a bid to out up a unified slate for 2022. She was again caught dealing with them in bad faith when she made it appear that she was approached when, the fact is, it was her Chief of Staff who reached out to his counterpart at Sotto’s office. Her supporters’ battlecry has been “Let Leni Lead”. But how can she lead when she does not manifest basic leadership qualities?
Perhaps the most glaring disconnect is in Robredo’s continued claim that she won over Bongbong Marcos in the 2016 race. Marcos has consistently come out as the second or third choice in both Presidential and Vice-Presidential preference rankings in all surveys. Robredo can’t even manage to scratch in a comparable showing. The ugly truth is Marcos won that race. How Robredo emerged the winner only she knows. The writing on the wall is clear. She will not win if she runs in 2022. The majority of Filipinos have been repudiating her “victory” for the past five years but she refuses to acknowledge this fact. Maybe she’s really in an alternative parallel reality existence in her own head. God forbid she becomes President.",Others
"Apart from Bamban Mayor Alice Guo, We Have Foreign Meddling in a Boracay Property Dispute Too? (Part One)",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/apart-from-bamban-mayor-alice-guo-we-have-foreign-meddling-in-a-boracay-property-dispute-too/,"I’d say the Philippines has more than enough to contend with in as far as foreign meddling is concerned.
Having watched and read news of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo’s now questionable citizenship and alleged connection with illegal activities in a POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator) sitting on property in her town, I feel drawn towards the impression that the Duterte Administration was operating the Philippines more like a brothel house solely for his Chinese national cronies rather than protecting and serving the welfare  and interests of the Filipino people.
Foreign meddling seems like an abstract concept until one considers the victims of the crime and corruption of POGO operations. In the case of the Bamban POGO, the victims were people who were lured into human trafficking or tricked out of their money through various scams. (If illegal drugs, torture, and killings somehow came into the picture, I wouldn’t be surprised because who knows what really happens in these POGO enclaves.)
Over in Boracay, a resort town on an island North of Panay, is another sort of meddling by a 73 year old British national who makes it appear on social media that he is legally operating a media enterprise of a sort in the Philippines. Although, how he could manage to do that in a country that restricts the foreign ownership of mass media is unclear to me at this point.
The Philippine Constitution limits the ownership and management of mass media to citizens of the Philippines or corporations, cooperatives, or associations that are wholly-owned and managed by citizens.
The 12th Regular Foreign Investment Negative List (RFINL) issued in June 2022 prohibits foreign equity in mass media, except for recording and internet. The Anti-Dummy Law (ADL) also prohibits foreigners from being appointed to management positions in nationalized or partly nationalized businesses.
Foreign journalists and newsmen need to apply for a temporary visitor’s visa to visit the Philippines. They will need to provide a curriculum vitae, work credits, sample article, media organization background, administrative arrangements, equipment list, flight details, and photographs.
To operate media enterprises in the Philippines, foreign media must apply for an IPC Accreditation Form and Bio-data/General Application Form for Special Work Permit at the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID). Each crew member will need to pay P6,440.00 plus P60.
As for engaging in advertising and promotions, Section 11, Article XVI, 1987 Constitution. “xxx Only Filipino citizens or corporations or associations at least seventy per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens shall be allowed to engage in the advertising industry
Thing is a simple search on Facebook reveals a multitude of posts of him promoting events and places in Boracay. Below are just two recent posts by Jeffery.
Moreover, foreigners are not allowed to influence/lobby for the creation and implementation of policies. As such, a number of Jeffery’s posts on Facebook gives the impression of being able to get officials in Aklan to pass or revise a number of policies favoring foreign nationals as well as tourists.
Victor Jeffery, who portrays himself on Facebook as being married to a Filipina, has taken on the cause of championing the “rights” a Canadian couple whom he claims were victims of intimidation and forcible eviction. Likewise, the British national has also taken the cause of a lawyer who claims to be the owner of true owner of the place where the Canadians were evicted from.
Jeffery would appear to be some sort of crusader setting the heathens straight, UNTIL you learn about the other side of the story he isn’t telling on Facebook.
Since Jeffery published an account of events which took place at a place called The Cliff on Mt. Luho in Boracay, it is in the public interest to know the other side of this story which he has HIDDEN in attempt to gain sympathy for the Canadian couple and the lawyer claiming to be the owner of The Cliff.
In Jeffery’s account, which was published in the Facebook Group named Boracay Island News where he is an administrator, he states:
Boracay Community.
What’s going on up at Mt Luho?
Angry property disputes have started again at several locations in the Mt Luho area despite many court cases over the past few years.
Can we not handle these matters at local level before they blow into an international incident and bring disrepute and damage to Boracay’s reputation. (Emphasis added.)Surely, due legal process instead of heavily armed security should be the order here. These residents have rights also.
While not directly accusing Ramos of using intimidation, harassment, skirting due legal process, and disregarding rights, Jeffery’s public Facebook post containing bare allegations unfairly portrays Ramos in such a bad light that it could have already damaged her reputation. A sure sign of the bad reputation Jeffery’s Facebook post inflicted upon Ramos were negative comments that could be construed as being directed at Ramos.
Case in point is an exchange between Jeffery and a Facebook account holder named Rosemarie Sen.
Rosemarie Sen
Victor Jeffery
Several people I know who are longtime occupants there hold court documents stating they own their properties Rosemarie. One is a Supreme Court ruling. Apparently, all the invading security guards have are guns – no paperwork.
Surely the ‘rule of law’ should be upheld and provide adequate protection for those who have already had legal rulings on their cases.
Rosemarie Sen
Victor Jeffery Are they still in their houses or they left because of these intimidation, gangster, and thuggery tactics? (Emphasis added.)
It is really mind boggling where Rule Of Law is non existent on these cases!
Jeffery didn’t stop with one Facebook post in Boracay Island News, he made another post on May 11 which he updated a few days later on May 18.
On May 11, Jeffery wrote:
Boracay Community
The Philippine National Police (PNP) has been asked to revoke the permit of a security agency over its role in the alleged illegal takeover of a property at world-famous Boracay Island in Malay town, Aklan province.
Lawyer Lucas C. Licerio urged the PNP Supervisory Office for Security and Investigation Agencies (SOSIA) to terminate or suspend the permit of Safety Protection Yielders Security Agency (SPY) Security Agency over the incident.
Licerio pleaded in a letter dated May 2 to Police Col. Marlou Roy Alzate, SOSIA chief, to act against SPY Security Agency. “The security agency is implementing unlawful orders from its client,” Licerio said.
He said that SPY security guards have taken over armed men and assumed jurisdiction over the Licerio Estates since April 24.
SPY security guards reportedly denied entry to individuals who have private villas inside the Licerio Estates, including foreign nationals from Canada and Russia.
This was the latest incident in a more than a decade-long legal battle over the Licerio Estates.
Licerio, who represented his family as co-heirs, initially sold 700-square meters of the more than one-hectare property to Dolora Khanna in May 2007.
Not long after, Khanna filed an injunction plea against Licerio to vacate the entire property.
The injunction plea that was eventually denied by the court in Kalibo, Aklan led to the discovery that Khanna falsified documents that made it appear that she owned the entire Licerio Estates. She also sold portions of the land that she did not own.
Khanna would later be convicted of estafa through falsification of public documents by a court in Kalibo. She had a warrant of arrest but she reportedly has fled the country.
Licerio said that before Khanna left the country, Khanna tapped Marichi Ramos of Bacolod City to be the attorney-in-fact to manage the Licerio Estates.
Ramos allegedly took over the management of the estate that Khanna does not legally own while claiming she has legal rights over the land.
Police reports said Ramos and German national Charles Schmidt went to the Licerio Estates on the night of April 23 with armed men to physically take over the property.
By April 24, SPY guards came to the Licerio Estates to render duty for the camp of Ramos and Schmidt.
“The SPY guards, therefore, are committing illegal and criminal acts either as principals or accessory in violation of their sworn duty as deputized agents of the PNP to uphold the law,” said Licerio in the letter to Alzate.
Licerio called on SPY Security Agency “to immediately cancel or terminate its contract with Ramos or anybody acting on her behalf involving Licerio Estates.”
A copy of the letter was also furnished Police Brig. Gen. Jack Wanky, Police Regional Office-6 chief.
Again, Jeffery puts out a one sided story where he claims lawyer Licerio alleges that Ramos had illegally taken over his property and it would have been believed by the PNP SOSIA if Ramos hadn’t written to the office to counter Licerio’s allegations.
In her letter to Philippine National Police PRO Region VI Regional Commander, Brigadier General Jack Wanky, Ramos alleges that Licerio, without contributing anything to the construction, forcibly took over the resort using armed men pretending to be police officers, and has been illegally selling and leasing the property ever since. She further claims that Licerio turned over the villas to Canadian nationals who were not authorized to own properties in the Philippines, and that they engaged in human trafficking by operating a brothel.
Ramos also mentions a previous complaint filed against Licerio for the illegal takeover, where the Security and Investigation Services of the Philippine National Police (SOSIA) ruled in her favor. This order, Ramos argues, prohibits Licerio from deploying any security agency at The Cliff Resort without complying with certain requirements.
The letter presents a complex case with multiple allegations of wrongdoing, including:
Illegal takeover: Ramos alleges that Licerio forcibly took over the resort using armed men, violating her property rights.
Fraudulent activities: Ramos claims that Licerio has been illegally selling and leasing the villas, defrauding potential buyers and renters.
Human trafficking: Ramos claims that the Canadian nationals who took over the villas engaged in human trafficking by operating a brothel.
Violation of SOSIA order: Ramos argues that Licerio is violating the previous SOSIA order by deploying another security agency without fulfilling the necessary requirements.
(It’s important to note that these are just allegations made by Ramos. The veracity of these claims requires further investigation and legal proceedings.)",Others
Re-engineering Philippine US Relations in the Advent of Chinese Expansionism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/re-engineering-philippine-us-relations-in-the-advent-of-chinese-expansionism/,"Navigating the intricate web of Philippine interests amidst the volatile relationship between China and the United States presents a formidable challenge. The situation is further complicated by recurrent Chinese interference with Philippine resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre and escalating internal political rivalries fueled by the upcoming 2025 electoral campaign season.
Picture a scenario akin to playing multidimensional chess on a constantly shifting toroidal surface amidst the chaos of a free-for-all MMA fight. This analogy encapsulates the complexity and intensity of the situation.
For the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, this tumultuous reality fills his days in what would be the twilight years of most other man.
This may have given rise to the notion that he is a man in a precarious position and therefore, a potential weak link in the chain of steps the country needs should it decide to leverage its ties with the United States against China’s creeping maritime expansion.
It might have appeared this way to the Chinese during the term of former President Rodrigo R. Duterte. They may have perceived him either as a passive diplomat when it comes to leveraging America’s military power or a convenient “kill switch” that could be easily triggered in case Duterte’s erratic behavior led him to seek favor with the US.
Recent developments, however, tend to reveal Romualdez as an integral figure in the reengineering of the country’s military relations with the US to support a stronger, assertive stance with regards to the West Philippine Sea.
This makes Romualdez a high value target of China’s psychological war machinery and consequently, with the connivance of their Filipino sympathizers, China has unleashed sustained attacks on his reputation with the intent of removing him from office.
If they succeed, the repercussions would be devastating and enormously set back the country’s efforts to secure its claims on the West Philippine Sea.
His removal would strain relations between the Philippines and the US, signaling instability in the diplomatic relationship.
The US-Philippines security alliance could suffer immensely, leading to a dramatic decline in military cooperation and joint exercises, ultimately undermining regional security and stability.
It could be perceived as succumbing to Chinese pressure, tarnishing the reputation of the Philippine government and its ability to uphold sovereignty.
Despite the unrelenting attacks on his reputation, Romualdez has proven immovable as he stands firmly on the remarkable accomplishments that distinguished his career as Philippine ambassador to the US.
While operating under the guidance of President Bongbong Marcos and in alignment with the entire executive department, Ambassador Romualdez has been recognized for his pivotal role in reshaping military relations with the US in response to China’s expansionism.
Appointed in 2017, Romualdez has tirelessly navigated the intricate dynamics between maintaining sovereignty and fostering international partnerships. His diplomatic prowess has been instrumental in ushering in a new era of Philippine-U.S. relations characterized by mutual respect and strategic cooperation.
One of Romualdez’s notable achievements is the strengthening of the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the Philippines and the United States. He has engaged in ongoing discussions with U.S. officials to ensure the defense commitments under the MDT are unequivocally upheld. This is particularly crucial given the escalating threat from China’s actions in the South China Sea. Romualdez’s efforts have led to high-profile visits from U.S. defense and state secretaries, solidifying the United States’ backing for Philippine sovereignty.
He has also been instrumental in expanding joint military exercises and defense equipment procurements to enhance the Philippines’ defense capabilities. Through initiatives like the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), the Philippines has gained access to cutting-edge military technology and training, essential for safeguarding its territorial waters.
Beyond military collaboration, Romualdez has championed economic partnership and development. Recognizing the pivotal role of economic stability, he has facilitated investments and trade opportunities beneficial to both nations. His initiatives have attracted U.S. companies to invest in various sectors, including technology, infrastructure, and renewable energy, making his engagements with cabinet officials pivotal in securing billions of dollars in business investments.
Balancing the delicate relationship between China and the U.S. is no small task. Ambassador Romualdez has adeptly managed these relations, ensuring that while the Philippines strengthens its defense ties with the U.S., it also maintains a pragmatic relationship with China. His diplomatic finesse reflects an understanding of the interconnected nature of global politics and the significance of a multifaceted foreign policy.
One of Romualdez’s key strategies has been to advocate for a rules-based order in the South China Sea, leveraging international legal frameworks like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). His diplomatic engagements underscore the importance of peaceful dispute resolution, upholding international law, and fostering regional stability.
As Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea unfolds, Ambassador Romualdez’s role in Philippine-U.S. relations becomes increasingly vital. His leadership exemplifies how skilled diplomacy can yield substantial benefits in terms of security, economic growth, and international standing.
The re-engineered multi-faceted relationship with the United States, under his guidance, stands as a testament to the power of strategic partnership in navigating the complexities of modern geopolitics.

American militarism and Filipino naivete creates no pragmatism,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/american-militarism-and-filipino-naivete-creates-no-pragmatism/,"Prior to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s state visit to Japan, Filipino netizens reacted with mixed emotions about the approval and expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Supporters of the EDCA and its expansion quickly pointed out that cooperation with the United States in responding against counter-terrorism and natural calamities would be greatly beneficial for the Philippines. On the other hand, pundits point out that this would escalate tensions and raise the stakes in the geopolitical dynamics of the Asia-Pacific, mentioning that American saber-rattling may agitate the People’s Republic of China (PROC) and prompt it to adopt a more aggressive and bellicose stance. What is definitely at play in the Asia-Pacific, and what should the Philippines be cautious about?
The geopolitical realities of the Asia-Pacific during the 1890’s were completely different, with a significantly weakening Spanish control of the Philippines. To its west was French Indochina, and to its south were the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya. On its north was an emerging expansionist great power in Japan. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the Philippine archipelago was officially under American occupation. As a way to differentiate Washington from its European colonial powers in London and Paris, the American government adopted a policy called benevolent assimilation, where the United States attempted to create a Philippines in its own image and likeness, most specially in its political systems and institutions.
After the harrowing end of the Second World War, Manila and Washington oversaw the signing of a mutual defense treaty, firmly placing the Philippines within American orbit. This treaty allows the United States to issue a declaration of war towards any aggressor state to the Philippines and vice versa, despite being subject to the approval of their respective Congresses. Paired with the Military Bases Agreement, such commitments proved useful for the United States, where Subic and Clark served as American staging points during the Vietnam War. However, the aforementioned agreement became too unpopular, which resulted in it not being renewed by the Philippine Senate in 1991.
Before 1991 came to an end, a surprising development changed the world order with the Soviet Union’s dissolution. American political scientist Francis Fukuyama mentioned in his book “The End of History and the Last Man” that the humankind will eventually transform and adopt liberal democracy as its government system. This can be true for previously Soviet-aligned or incorporated countries like the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia, but it seems to be the complete opposite when one considers the biggest elephant in the room: China.
China’s transformation began under the tutelage of their paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, who famously said that getting rich is glorious. Economic reforms went underway, where policies connected to “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” were adopted. With reduced government oversight in economic development, creation of special economic zones, and lifting of economic restrictions, the People’s Republic was able to single-handedly lift millions of Chinese out of poverty. These resulted in China dethroning Japan as the largest Asian economy, with a massive 1.4 billion market and a burgeoning export-oriented manufacturing industry to back its tremendous size.
Learning from the failures of the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was relatively conservative in enforcing political reforms. He pushed for less concentration of political power and influence, which was a complete opposite to his predecessor’s personality cult. He adopted a two-term limit for Chinese leaders, giving them a maximum of ten years, which he, himself, has followed. His successors in Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao served for two consecutive terms, until Xi Jinping abolished these limits, where he is currently serving his third, five-year term. Despite the rising authoritarianism of the police state in China, Deng Xiaoping’s foresight and pragmatism can be succinctly summarized with his “Black cat, white cat” proverb.
With a rising China and a stagnating America, confrontation in one way or another is inevitable. American investor Ray Dalio in his book “The Changing World Order” highlighted a number of historical instances when the ruling power was eventually challenged and overtaken by a different nation-state. The first example is when the Dutch emerged victorious in dethroning the Spanish during the 17th century with the Thirty Years’ War. The second example is when the British became too wealthy and powerful for Amsterdam to confront, where through the Napoleonic Wars, London became the most dominant power. The third example is when the Americans extended their influence to many parts of the world, with Britain eventually acquiescing due to its tremendous losses in both World Wars. All these instances have a common denominator in these power transitions, which are unimaginable bloodshed and damages to properties.
Unfortunately, geopolitical realities that continually challenge the status quo never change. For China, accessing the Pacific Ocean lies on the subjugation of the First Island Chain, which includes the territorial waters of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Aside from being the third largest economy, Japan is considered as a nuclear latent country, where it has all the capabilities of developing, mass-producing, and delivering nuclear weapons. Despite its measly population of slightly less than 25 million, Taiwan employs conscription and is a strategically important nation-state, with its virtual monopoly of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Considering these factors, the Philippines is undoubtedly the weakest link. Manila doesn’t have a massive economy, nor does it have nuclear capabilities. Unlike Taiwan, conscription is not employed in the Philippines and has no resources nor material products that can come close to the strategic value of these technologically advanced chips. With these realities, why does the Philippines need to be involved in a possible military conflict that Filipinos have virtually nothing to gain from?
As a regional hegemon, the United States has maximized its chances for survival. Despite this, they are employing a Cold War strategy in confronting China, through “containment” as Washington has aligned the common interests of Tokyo, Taipei, Manila, New Delhi, and Canberra. Undoubtedly, an arms race is brewing in Asia Pacific, raising tensions in these contested territories. Then-US President Dwight Eisenhower’s words warning the whole world about the dangers of the military-industrial complex might seem proverbial as military conflicts raise the demand and sale of American materiel. This can be observed when stocks of American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon becoming highly profitable. To complicate things further, stockholders of these companies are also members of the US Congress. What kind of cards will the Philippines have under its sleeves if the United States seems to be driven by war profiteering?
Deterring aggression from two superpowers will be a herculean task for any middling power like the Philippines, and it entails a meticulous balancing effort. Stationing American military personnel in Philippine territory by renegotiating EDCA would be a no-brainer to avoid alienating China. Implementation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program should also be observed, while continuous investment in procuring advanced military hardware for the armed forces is a must. To sustainably fund this building up of military capabilities and assets, foreign investors must be allowed to freely own and operate businesses in the country through economic liberalization. After all, a strong, robust economy yields a strong, robust republic.",Others

"China Struggles Against Stronger PH WPS Posture, Backed By US and Other Countries",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/china-struggles-against-stronger-ph-wps-posture-backed-by-us-and-other-countries/,"China’s bumper buggy aggression against Philippine maritime vessels in the West Philippine Sea appears to be a reaction to the country’s growing strength in its overall defense posture, one punctuated last month by honors accorded to the Philippine flag at the United States Marine Corps Barracks in Washington DC — its oldest post.
Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez was invited to be the guest of honor at the USMC Washington Evening Parade where the Philippine flag was raised — the first time a foreign flag was honored since 1957. The Marine Band also performed the Philippine national anthem twice, for the foreign colors and as musical honors for the Ambassador.
Ambassador Romualdez’s attendance at the Evening Parade symbolizes the continuing friendship and cooperation between the Philippines and the United States. This honor comes as the Ambassador returns from Manila, where he participated in the 2+2 bilateral meeting last July 30. During this meeting, both countries reaffirmed the importance of the ironclad Philippines-US alliance. The discussions led to a US$500 million commitment in foreign military financing from the 2024 Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, earmarked for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
This financial support underscores the depth of the Philippines-US partnership, which is rooted in key agreements such as the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951, the Visiting Forces Agreement of 1998, and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement of 2014.
Philippine and US Marines remain steadfast in their commitment to advancing regional security and stability while enhancing collective military readiness. This commitment is displayed through the recent participation of Filipino Marines at the 2024 Rim of the Pacific Exercise, 2024 Marine Aviation Support Activity (MASA) littoral live fire exercise, and Exercise Balikatan 24, and most prominently, the KAMANDAG exercises, which have been held annually since 2016.
Furthermore, the Philippine Marine Corps and the US Marine Forces Pacific will co-host the 2025 in the Pacific Amphibious Leaders Symposium, where 32 countries are scheduled to unite and discuss the enhancement of maritime security in the region.
Ambassador Romualdez has been the Philippine ambassador to the US since the Duterte administration, a feat that gives him a unique and deep understanding of PH US ties that many say will redound to the smooth continuation of US foreign policy in Asia even as it transitions to a new administration after its elections this year.
Peace be upon you!
Hello everyone, my name is Oman and I am a Middle Eastern man who has been fortunate enough to receive my education in the United Kingdom.
I am excited to share my political insights on the Philippines, a country that has been my home for the past thirty years.
Having grown up in the Middle East, I was initially drawn to the Philippines for its vibrant culture, warm hospitality, and breathtaking landscapes. Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for this beautiful nation and its people, which has fueled my desire to understand and contribute to its political landscape.
Living here for three decades has allowed me to witness firsthand the country’s political evolution, from the turbulent times to the remarkable progress it has achieved. I have closely observed the challenges, triumphs, and the resilience of the Filipino people, which have shaped my unique perspective on its political affairs.",Others
CIA hijacks Philippine foreign policy,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/cia-hijacks-philippine-foreign-policy/,"The Philippines is now focused on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), with the expanded agreement covering access to an additional four Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) facilities and the expansion of an airstrip in the Balabac Island group in Palawan. It was Philippine Ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez who made the announcement, not the President and not even Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo.
President Bongbong Marcos is supposed to be the chief architect of foreign policy but there are many who are inclined to believe that Romualdez is in-charge, vice Manalo, who is also unabashedly, pro-US.
The Philippines and the US recently concluded a two-plus-two one-on-one meeting between US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with their Philippine counterparts, Enrique Manalo and Carlito Galvez last March. This was also under the auspices of Romualdez but what observers noted was while the US was able to obtain much concessions from the Philippines, the latter wasn’t able to receive the same in return, primarily on the efforts of the Philippines to access a bigger piece of America’s market. The US betrayed the Philippines again.
Did Ambassador Babe Romualdez fight for the Philippine interest as hard as he fights for US military interests in the Philippines?
Filipinos Collateral Damage for US Interest
While Marcos continues to enjoy popular support coming off his record win at the polls in May 2022, critical-thinking Filipinos are wary of his pivot to the US given the risk involved in provoking retaliation from China through increased tensions in the disputed waters in the South China Sea and the fact that China is the top trading partner of the country, and major partner in infrastructure development.
All of these developments are coming on the heels of the perceived weakening of the US with its failures in Iraq and Afghanistan and the largely ineffective sanctions on Russia, which has been relying on the advice of Iran for ways to go around the American ban given they have been under the same regime since 1979.
It doesn’t help that the US trade sanctions on China have had the effect of fueling anti-American sentiment in key regions around the world. China has brokered a semblance of peace between the Saudis and the Iranians. The same is true with Syria. There are also African countries which have announced their disengagement with their former colonial rulers such as France. There have been widespread protests in France and Germany against NATO support for Ukraine and the continuing escalation of inflation in the continent due to US and NATO sanctions on Russian energy exports.
By far the largest elephant in the room which remains unaddressed is the bombing of the Nord Stream pipeline and subsequent expose by prominent American journalist Seymour Hersh that the US was behind it.
How Many Filipinos Will Die for America?
The Philippines was on the wrong side of history when the Pacific War broke out, leading to over a million Filipinos perishing. But those were circumstances beyond its control because it was the subject of horse trading between the declining Spanish empire and the rising American empire.
Pax Britannia ended after World War II. Pax Americana began with the Monroe Doctrine and continued with the ascendancy of the US during the Cold War and the fight against the spread of communism in Asia.
Another million Filipinos died in World War 2, Japan and America fought each other in the Philippines and obliterated Manila.
While America continues projecting itself as fighting for good versus evil, it has created far more deaths and destructions since WW2, and had turned nations into warzones many remaining so to this day. American economic and financial hegemony through the dollar is ending and this development is too serious to just sweep under the rug and say that in the end, America will still emerge triumphant.
But we need to keep a close watch on the pro-American cabal surrounding BBM. They have his ear and he has been dancing to the tune they’ve been playing even before his inauguration. If the government and the AFP isn’t going to protect the people as provided for in the Constitution, then we, the people, have no other choice but to protect ourselves.
Is Babe Romualdez the Filipino Edward Lansdale?
One can’t help but compare Romualdez to Edward Lansdale, the former US Air Force officer who was the Central Intelligence Agency’s resident chief in the Philippines after World War II. It was Lansdale who engineered the rise of Ramon Magsaysay to the Presidency. Many believe he was also behind Magsaysay’s death in a plane crash in Cebu.
Lansdale also worked with the AFP in counter-insurgency operations against the Huks. Lansdale was believed to have recruited Ninoy Aquino as a CIA operative. The same is true with Ninoy’s close friend, Max Soliven, who attended college at Fordham University in New York. Soliven and Romualdez became close after the Marcos’ fall from power.
The crowning move, as it seems, has been secured, with the announcement that President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. will be embarking on a working visit to the US in May with a meeting in the White House with key officials led by President Joe Biden and top members of his Cabinet.",Others
The Senate: a political institution that lost its luster,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/the-senate-a-political-institution-that-lost-its-luster/,"The Philippine Senate is a political institution that was created during the American occupation years. Also called “the upper house”, the Senate is a legislative body that can be traced back to the Philippine Commission, which was created to assist the Americans in administering government powers in the Philippines. According to the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Senate is composed of 24 senators, where 12 seats will be up for grabs every three years. A senator can only serve two consecutive six-year terms, for a total of 12 years. As senators are elected by the whole country, it requires candidates to be immensely popular as the electorate votes for 12 senators every three years.
Aside from its legislative responsibilities, the current constitution grants additional powers to the members of the Senate. Senators are needed to complete the Commission on Appointments, where approval is required from the aforementioned commission before department secretaries and ambassadors officially assume their duties in their respective departments or foreign posts. The Senate also has the ability to impeach the president and the chief justice, albeit requiring the House of Representatives’ (lower house’s) consent. In addition, the Senate ratifies treaties signed with other countries, whether bilateral or multilateral in nature. These strong powers granted by the constitution to the Senate provide an impression that, ideally, the upper chamber must be filled with respectable, competent, and dignified individuals who are committed to defend the interests of the Philippine archipelago and of the Filipino people. However, reality seems distant to what is ideal.
The current political reality is that, the Senate is no longer the political institution that it should be. This can be seen when one keenly observes and contextualizes the general and midterm elections held from 1992 until 2022. Three decades’ history of electing senators reveal patterns that put a spotlight light on how feeble and fragile political institutions are in the Philippines. With such, there are two election observations that must be noted vis-à-vis the Philippine Senate.
The first observation is that, the winning candidates who garner the most number of votes are usually showbiz or media personalities, or candidates who are directly related to these individuals The exemptions would be the 1995 elections with current Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 2016 elections with then-Senator Franklin Drilon, and the 2019 elections with current Senator Cynthia Villar. However, in the 2016 senatorial elections, Senator Tito Sotto ranked third, while current Senator Grace Poe held to the second position in the 2019 elections. This leaves the 1995 senatorial elections as the only genuine exemption to such generalization.
The second observation is that, the Senate is becoming a mere launching pad for politicians who eye higher positions in the next general elections, which are the Offices of the President and the Vice President. In the 1992 elections, then-Senator Joseph Estrada became Vice President and in the next general elections, he won the presidency with then-Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo occupying his previous position. In the 2004 elections, the ticket of Arroyo-de Castro emerged victorious, who both had legislative experience as senators. In 2010, then-Senator Benigno Aquino III won Malacanang and, last year, Ferdinand Marcos Jr cruised his way to a landslide victory for the country’s top position after also serving as a one-term senator. Only the 2016 general elections would serve as an exemption, as both then-Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and then-Camarines Sur Representative Ma. Leonor Robredo held no position in the Senate. Aside from the eventual winning candidates and then-Vice President Jejomar Binay, the 2016 elections were crowded with senators who ran for higher office.
Connecting these two observations regarding Philippine electoral results together, it becomes evident that the Senate is no longer the illustrious political institution that it was initially meant to be. Gone are the days when Filipino luminaries like Miriam Defensor Santiago, Juan Flavier, Blas Ople, and Joker Arroyo, who exemplified competence, genuine public service, and a solid understanding of Philippine realpolitik graces the Senate halls. Unfortunately, the senate has degraded and become a stark reflection of a deeply-embedded oligarchy and oligopoly that stubbornly resists political reform. However, these politicians cannot be blamed completely because the current political system of the Philippines incentivizes them to lean more towards popularity instead of competence. Luckily, the Philippines can learn from world history through the successes of the Roman Senate and the United States Senate, which are political institutions that played significant roles in nation-building.
Albeit different from its legislative powers that are associated with modern upper chambers, the Roman Senate served as a governing body from the formation of the humble Etruscan city-state of Rome until the eventual disintegration of the Roman Empire. The changing powers of the Roman Senate reflected the economic, political, and social realities that Rome has faced, where the aforementioned political institution served as the basis for the Romans in creating a strong state. Despite its shortcomings, the Roman Senate allowed itself to undergo structural reform and surrender some of its powers due to external pressures. This allowed the Roman state to effectively and efficiently respond to national exigencies which allowed the Roman civilization to last for more than a millennium.
On the other hand, the American Senate, which serves as the other half of the bicameral legislature of the United States, roughly plays the same roles and is afforded similar powers to that of the Philippine Senate. However, what sets the United States Senate apart from its Philippine counterpart is its structure. The current American Senate is composed of 100 senators, where each state is represented by two senators, who in turn are elected by their state electorate. Despite qualms over proposals to adjust the numbers of senatorial representation that would reflect their respective demographics, the two senators per state structure was designed to avoid tyranny of the majority. If it wasn’t the case, the sheer numerical superiority of the states of California, Texas, Florida, and New York can easily silence the interests of Vermont, Alaska, Delaware, and Wyoming.
Looking at the cases of the senates of Rome and the United States, the Philippines’ upper house must definitely undergo political restructuring. Ideally, the Senate must be an institution that acknowledges and works toward the protection and promotion of Philippine national interests, but the reality seems to be far from it as it has merely become a bastion of political ambition. How can representative democracy work in the Philippines when the upper chamber is predominantly represented by individuals hailing from Luzon and Metro Manila? Will these senators understand the hardships of the heavily-marginalized regions and provinces of the Philippines? If Filipinos desire political reform, most specially in the senate, it begins and ends with charter change.",Others
Ping Lacson declares war on wasteful government spending and corruption,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/ping-lacson-declares-war-on-wasteful-government-spending-and-corruption/,"It would appear that the noose is getting tighter around the neck of Health Secretary Francisco Duque over the release of the latest COA report summarizing the glaring deficiencies in its compliance with government accounting standards as defined by the audit agency.
GMA News Online reports that Sen. Panfilo Lacson has again called out Duque for his continuing incompetence in the management and operations of the Department of Health (DOH) which is the lead department in the government’s pandemic response.
Among the most glaring findings by the COA were P67B in deficiencies for Covid response allotments, P65B in deficiencies for centrally-procured assets, P95B in expired and nearly expired medicines in warehouses, P24B in unobligated allotments and a whopping P557M in disbursements which did not comply with established practices resulting in unnecessary and excessive expenditures.
The newly-installed Partido Reporma Chair and declared Presidential candidate vowed to put Duque through the wringer when he comes before the Senate Committee on Finance to defend the 2022 budget of his department.
Lacson has declared war on wasteful and excessive government spending at a time when the government is in dire need of funds for the pandemic response in terms of vaccine procurement and social amelioration for the poorest Filipinos. He has vowed not to increase taxes but focus on curbing corruption and ensuring that public funds are spent as allocated in the national budget if elected President in 2022.",Others
The Yellowtard agenda is to ensure the status quo of OLIGARCH-backed colonial rule persists,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/the-yellowtard-agenda-is-to-ensure-the-status-quo-of-oligarch-backed-colonial-rule-persists/,"Neoliberals like Richard Javad Heydarian are the first to put the blame for the Philippines’ troubles on the so-called “bobotantes“. In his Inquirer column “The foolish myth of ‘bobotante’ voters”, he points out that “authoritarian nostalgists shouldn’t forget that their idols wouldn’t have made it to Malacañang without the support of a plurality of urban poor and marginalized Filipinos, who constitute the majority of the electorate.” He then goes on to justify the “victory” of Leni Robredo, Vico Sotto and Isko Moreno to these very same bobotantes.
Step back from all that and the bigger, more important question comes to light: Can any one of the latter really be capable of the kind of leadership demanded of a President? Just the other day, former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile shared his thoughts about Constitutional amendments. The Malolos Congress established a parliamentary form of government. This was short-lived because of the Philippine-American War. The Philippine Assembly during the American colonial period was also parliamentary in nature because it was a unicameral body. It was amended later to become a bicameral body which is what the country found itself with after “independence” in 1946. Former President Ferdinand Marcos couldn’t get his agenda through Congress so he convened the 1971 Constitutional Convention. We switched to a parliamentary form of government but Marcos could still enact laws by Presidential Decree.
In itself, the problem is both structural and cultural. The plantation-style democracy was still in place because power was held by the rich who had their politician subordinates do their dirty work for them. Marcos didn’t have the provenance of the typical politician then. Imelda had more provenance being a member of the Romualdez clan of Pandacan and Tacloban. The global political order saw the rise of populists because of the failure of neoliberalism and its policies. We are the only Asian country with a political structure patterned after America.
It’s high time that we finally take our identity as Asians rather than the false belief that we are “Americans.” We also need to rid ourselves of our present colonizers, the oligarchs who continue to exercise control over politics and the economy. Marcos tried but failed to establish our national identity. The coming election will be an opportunity to vote for a candidate who is undoubtedly Pro-Filipino and not just a lackey of oligarchs and foreign interests. But we definitely need to change the political structure if we are to improve the social conditions where we as Filipinos exist.",Others
Should the Philippines host Afghan refugees?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/should-the-philippines-host-afghan-refugees/,"Roughly a year ago, the United States withdrew their military assets and personnel from Afghanistan as Taliban forces were gained more and more territories. As Afghans rushed to the airport to catch the last airplane departing Kabul, videos and images of people latching themselves onto to this jet in a final yet desperate futile attempt at leaving Afghanistan flooded social media. Washington’s international standing took a deep nosedive as American politicians and bureaucrats found that they had bitten off more than what they can chew. Now, they are requesting Manila to allow these Afghan refugees into Philippine territory — an issue that now divides Filipinos. Some individuals cited humanitarian reasons in allowing these refugees entry to Philippines. On the other hand, some people vehemently oppose such an arrangement because these refugees can become threats to national security. Looking at these points, we now ask: What is the most pragmatic and practical stance for the Philippines?
Afghanistan is a predominantly Islamic, land-locked country known for its mountainous yet barren topography. With geographical features that seem unsuitable for large-scale agriculture except for opium cultivation, nomadic pastoral groups like the Pashtuns moved together with their flock in search of food and water. This arid territory had bordered notable civilizations including the Indians, Persians, Russians, and the Chinese. Geopolitically, Afghanistan served as a buffer zone between the imperial expansionists of Moscow and London during their “Great Game” rivalry in the 19th century. With the Allies emerging victorious in the Second World War and London eventually granting independence to their most profitable colony, the Soviets exercised significant influence over the region as Kabul aligned itself more towards Moscow.
Hostilities during the Cold War also rocked Afghanistan. The fall of Saigon in 1975 sealed the fate of America’s military intervention in Vietnam. Washington’s embarrassing defeat inadvertently emboldened Soviet militaristic desires and the Soviet Union attacked Afghanistan and hijacked its political institutions. Despite their ideological differences, the Reagan administration supported mujahidin groups that embraced Islamic fundamentalism. Realpolitik called for supporting groups who confront and combat communist hegemony, which was in accordance to America’s containment policy at the time. Moscow’s internal struggles for power, paired with economic and political tribulations, led to the withdrawal of Soviet military forces which came to be regarded as eerily similar with how Viet Cong forces humbled the mighty Americans. This paved the way for these mujahids to take Kabul and establish their own monopoly of violence in Afghanistan.
As the world order became unipolar under American leadership, the September 11, 2001 attacks sent shockwaves across the globe. Osama bin Laden and his radicalized Islamic militant group Al Qaeda orchestrated these attacks and were being hosted by the Taliban. The Americans wanted vengeance and took justice into their own hands. They requested Kabul to surrender the aforementioned group to Washington. With the Taliban denying that request, a justifiable casus belli led the United States to put boots to the ground. Together with its allies, military forces of the United States invaded Afghanistan. Despite the war beginning during the Bush Jr. administration, it was the Obama administration that executed and witnessed the military operation that terminated Osama bin Laden.
With mounting grievances and war weariness sinking in American society, Washington’s attempt at nation-building in Afghanistan was a failure as no clear objectives were put in place. Ideally, military interventions should be swift and goal-oriented so as to control collateral damage and unwanted additional expenses. However, twenty years of propping up an American-backed Afghanistan reflected how feeble its state institutions were. Washington squandering its resources on the Afghan quagmire for two decades created three undesirable beneficiaries, none of which mirror American interests. The first beneficiary is China and Russia, because American military presence helped their own national security vis-à-vis Islamic terrorism. The second beneficiary would be the corrupt Afghan politicians who funneled foreign cash directly to their own pockets. The last beneficiary is the military-industrial-congressional complex of the United States as they are incentivized to act belligerently in selling armed conflict.
Currently, the Taliban leadership continues to sow fear and sorrow to their peoples. Islamic fundamentalism is returning, where women and girls are robbed of their basic rights such as education and recreation and deemed second class citizens. Brutal and inhumane means of oppression force Afghans to leave their own country, and the United States have officially requested the Philippines to host these individuals. Should Manila do it?
The Philippines has a long history of hosting refugees during international exigencies. During the Second World War, a number of Jews who experienced persecution in Nazi Germany were admitted by then-President Manuel Quezon. During the 1970’s, the Marcos Sr administration hosted thousands of Vietnamese refugees, while then-President Rodrigo Duterte was open to admitting some Rohingya migrants fleeing Myanmar. All these presidents cited humanitarian reasons in letting these refugees stay in the Philippines.
Needless to say, hosting refugees entails various factors that lie beyond humanitarianism as they should be eventually integrated and assimilated into the receiving country. Integration is a process where refugees would experience social inclusion and economic mobility, where their skills and talents would be properly utilized in the receiving country’s respective labor market and economy. On the other hand, assimilation is where migrants would adopt the local culture and become part of that country’s social fabric. Unfortunately, many developed countries are experiencing various issues integrating and assimilating migrants. Germany for its part, had been relatively welcoming of Syrian migrants during Angela Merkel’s term as chancellor. However, societal clashes in terms of culture and religion made integration a difficult subject because it involves taxpayers’ money spent on welfare programs. Home-grown terrorism in France is also a social issue as these migrant families and their offspring failed to assimilate in French society. This can also be observed in Great Britain where a number of British nationals sympathetic to the ISIS cause left the United Kingdom to become citizens of the aforementioned Islamic caliphate. If these wealthy countries are experiencing problems integrating and assimilating these immigrants, how much more developing countries like the Philippines, which have limited resources? Fortunately, the lessons of Bangladesh with Rohingya refugees are there to learn from.
Just like the Philippines, Bangladesh is a middle-income economy. It borders India and Myanmar. Being a predominantly Islamic country, the government of Dhaka welcomed Rohingya peoples leaving Myanmar’s Rakhine State to flee political repression. Many years have already passed but even until now, these migrants continue residing in ghetto-like refugee camps. Cholera runs rampant as clean sources of water are becoming scarce. With limited employment opportunities, they have virtually no financial capability to uplift themselves from poverty. Children are also growing up uneducated as their formative years are being wasted in these dehumanizing conditions. International organizations seem to have forgotten their commitments as Dhaka was unfortunately left to fend for itself. With those Afghan refugees, this situation might also happen in the Philippines if its leaders aren’t cognizant of the country’s limitations.
Manila must look at its own economic capabilities first, before engaging in international activities that require financial and monetary commitments. In the event that these Afghan refugees would arrive in the country, how can they be integrated and assimilated to Philippine society when prospects of employment are woeful even for local Filipinos? Hopefully, Manila must have already learned its lesson from Washington’s failures in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, which is not to bite more than what you can chew.",Others
Open Letter to Sec. Art Tugade: Pambu-budol ng Grab at Move It sa DOTr,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/open-letter-to-sec-art-tugade-pambu-budol-ng-grab-at-move-it-sa-dotr/,"To Sec. Art Tugade of the Dept. of Transportation:
Magandang araw sa inyo mula sa isang biktima ng monopoliya sa TNVS na walang choice kungdi mag-Grab car at soon, wala na ring choice kungdi mag Grab Motorcycle Taxi.
Bagamat napakaganda ng imahe po ninyo sa mga kaibigan ko sa Facebook at Youtube to the extent na sinasabi nilang pwedeng-pwede kayong maging senador, medyo nawiwindang naman ako sa nangyayari dito sa trabaho ng DOTr Technical Working Group para sa Pilot Testing ng Motorcycle Taxis. (Sa mga usapan namin tungkol sa TWG na ito ng ilang political at government observers, nabansagan na namin itong Terrible Working Group o Tolongges Working Group.)
Sa akin lang, baka mali ang mga friends kong isiping senatoriable po kayo kasi ang kelangan po naming sa senado eh yung sisita sa mga kalabisan at babalanse sa powers ng ibang branches of government.
Kaso, sa sarili niyong department, mukhang naiisahan kayo ng mga dapat sana’y taga-sunod at tagapag patupad ng mga utos ninyo.
Paano naman kasi Sec. Art, mukhang napapaboran na naman ng ultra-mega bongga ang banyagang ride hailing app na Grab.
Kung kayo po hindi nabobola at nabubudol ng Grab, itong mga bataan niyo mukhang sobrang daling mapa-ikot na parang gulong o tsubibo.
Hindi pa ba sapat na Grab na lang ang car ride hailing app, pati ba naman sa motorcycle taxi wala nang choice kungdi Grab?
Paano ko ba ito nasabi? Hindi ba tatlo ang motorcycle taxi hailing apps na kasama sa Pilot Testing?
Kung sa pangalan at itsura ng logo sa cellphone ang pagbabasehan sir, siyempre magmu-mukha silang tatlo.
Among motorcycle taxis po, andyan ang Angkas, Move-It at Joyride. Pero sa tatlong yan, mukhang dalawa ang sa Grab at isa lang ang hindi.
Technically daw po kasi ang Angkas eh kadikit ng bituka ng Grab at itong Move-It naman eh mukhang sa Grab na rin sa pamamagitan ng kiyeme-kiyemeng collaboration agreement. (Mukhang napilitan itong Move It dahil di nito kayang gampanan ang serbisyo nito.)
Pasensya na sa masasagasaang mga undersecretary at assistant secretary ninyo, pero mukhang sinasamantala nila ang pagka senior niyo at sa pamamagitan nitong collaboration agreement na di naman binuksan para masuri ng lahat, eh nakapasok itong Grab sa motorcycle taxis sa kabila ng pagpa-hold niyo dito.
Kumbaga nakapuslit at lumalabas na nag-backdoor itong Move It kasama ang Grab.
Supposed to be, itong collaboration agreement daw eh para lang sa data gathering. Okay, fine… kaso meron mga lumitaw na information na:
Kumbaga sa halaan o kabibi sa dalampasigan, balat na lang ito. Isang shell na walang laman. Sa sisteng yan, masasabing nagba-backdoor ang grab sa pagkakagamit nito ng anyo ng Move It.
Sir, siguro naman po naabutan niyo ang post WW II war na kasabihan na “if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and swins like a duck, IT IS A DUCK!”
Sa ibang salita kasi, lumalabas na sa Grab na ang Move It at nangangahulugan ito ng malaking kadupangan pagdating sa allocation ng mga riders sa bawat motorcycle taxi service.
Ayon na rin sa rules ng TWG, kung may aatras sa mga kasama sa Pilot Testing, ang rider allocation nito eh hahatiin sa nalalabing mga motorcycle taxi companies.
Kaso ang nangyari po sa pag-atras ng Move It, buong buong binigay ang allocation nito sa Grab.
Lumalabas nito, kung sa paghahati ng isang buo into thirds or tig-katlo, two thirds o dalawang katlo ang napunta kay Grab. Yung unang katlo sa kadikit ng bituka ng Grab at itong panglawang katlo kay Move it.
Hindi po dapat pinapayagan ang ganyang ka-swapangan kasi yung mga tumitingala sa inyo ang mismong mapeperwisyo kasi mawawalan sila ng choice kungdi ang magtiis sa masamang serbisyo na mataas ang presyo.
Yours truly,

Typhoon Carina Exposes Lies of US military Edca Bases in the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/08/typhoon-carina-exposes-lies-of-us-military-edca-bases-in-the-philippines/,"Last July 24, Filipinos woke up to the sound of heavy and widespread rain and raging flood all over Manila. Typhoon Carina was worse than what Metro Manila suffered during Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. Mother nature appeared to disprove the claim made by President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., in his State of the Nation Address (SONA), that his administration has completed 5,500 flood control projects, costing almost 500 billion pesos of taxpayers hard-earned money.
Filipinos were left wondering where the projects were and why these projects did  nothing to prevent the massive flooding they again suffered from.
No American Help Came for the Filipinos
Aside from the flood control projects, which Senator Imee Marcos also revealed cost almost P1.4 billion everyday, Filipinos were also wondering where the Americans were. After all, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) bases, majority of which are in Luzon, were touted by Filipino officials to help the Philippines in disaster relief operations but ironically, not a single helicopter or American servicemen, were seen helping the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) personnel. The valiant Philippine uniformed personnel, who were seen rescuing helpless victims were also under equipped in the massive need to rescue victims and clear roads of landslides and rock slides, caused by the heavy and continuous rainfall.
Why is the  Philippines Media Quiet on the Massive Lies?
Philippine media outlets, including investigative reporters from GMA News and ABS-CBN and fake news checkers like Rappler and Verafiles made did not question the veracity of the 5,500 flood control projects made during Marcos’s SONA or the statements of politicians that claimed the US military in the Philippines will help the Filipinos!
They chose to focus on the statements made by officials who blamed the high tide and the indiscriminate disposal of garbage as the main culprits which aggravated the flood which inundated the national capital region and nearby provinces.
The  media touted the $500 million PLEDGE by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who visited Manila on July 30, for a 2 + 2 dialogue with their counterparts, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo and Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro. This was the fourth 2 + 2 dialogue between US and Philippines officials as part of the Indo-Pacific strategy of the US in the region. Did Gibo or Manalo ask the Americans for their promised help?
There has been no visible presence of American troops stationed in the Philippines actively helping their counterparts in rescue and relief operations. It’s still up in the air as to when the promise of aid will be fulfilled as Blinken “pledged” $1M for the victims of Carina, which is roughly P58M only.
During the last Balikatan exercises held on April 22 to May 8, the US even brought in a
Typhoon missile battery and stationed it in Ilocos Norte, well within striking distance of China. This missile system launches Tomahawk cruise missiles, which are mainly launched by US Navy vessels and submarines. The deployment caused not only China, but also Russia, to issue warnings to the Philippine government, saying that it does not serve to bring down tensions in the region, and will be enough cause  for Russia and China to point their missiles on the Philippines.
The $500M “military aid” to the Philippines is by no means free because the monies are to be used as credit for the purchase of military equipment for the AFP, as part of its continuing modernization program. Many of these military aid are  secondhand and already considered as junk in the US, which might even endanger the lives of our soldiers.
America has openly admitted they are implementing their own first island strategy for their defense, using the Philippines as a proxy to contain China.  America’s focus is still on its self-interest of protecting the US mainland, ensuring the profits of its military-industrial complex and using the Philippines as its pawn in the region.
Last July 21, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced that the Philippines and China have come to a mutual agreement on the RoRe missions to the BRP Sierra Madre grounded on Ayungin Shoal. This was in the aftermath of the violent confrontation between the Philippine and Chinese coast guard personnel on July 17, where a Philippine Navy NAVSOG member lost a finger. The Marcos government toned down its anti-China rhetoric and resorted to diplomacy in a bid to resolve the issue, after China showed its hardline stance and no American help came, despite the claim that assistance was offered but declined, by the Philippine government.
Filipinos and the media should question the government about the true cost of the EDCA bases for the Philippines. The US is not only not paying any rental for the use of the bases but have placed the Philippines at greater risks against the enemies of the US.
The US military aid has spent millions for the expansion of what they deem to be essential such as the Basa Air Base in Pampanga, the Fernando Air Base in Batangas, and the old Subic naval base in Zambales, but havr not lifted a finger to help Filipinos in their time of need.
Typhoon Carina has proven the US, and our own Filipino officials, have lied to the people.
The EDCA bases are not for disaster relief but in reality, they are forward operating bases of the US Indo-Pacific Command, using the Philippines against China.
The Philippine Constitution expressly prohibits the presence of nuclear weapons in the country. This has already been repeatedly violated, including the most recent illegal stationing of the Typhoon missile battery in Ilocos Norte.
Why is the Philippines government extremely secretive about the activities of US and Japan military forces in the country?
Aside from the US, the Philippine government has also signed a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan, which allows Japanese troops to join their Philippine counterparts in military exercises and joint naval patrols. These are all part and parcel of the trilateral alliance between the US, Japan and the Philippines under JAPHUS.
Who is profiting from all this?
Poor Filipinos are left to fend for themselves, except for the ayuda distributed by the government and politicians who are already campaigning for votes as the 2025 election draws near. You have to wonder when Filipinos will realize that both the government and the Americans, continue to treat them as fools.",Others
Dismantling of the EDSA busway would have been an astounding injustice,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/02/dismantling-of-the-edsa-busway-would-have-been-an-astounding-injustice/,"It is laughable how, at a time when the decades-long insanity of car-centric design of urban spaces is finally losing steam across much of the sane world, some moron chucked another quintessentially-Filipino brainwave to have the EDSA bus lane removed.
The lane on the famously clogged highway blocked for exclusive use by public buses was a godsend for millions of Metro Manila citizens who represent the majority of its daily commuters. Though the facility continues to battle invasive private vehicles piloted by chi chi drivers of Manila’s elites who insist on access to its clearway on account of the “importance” of their journey, the concept held.
Before its implementation, the infamously for-profit private bus services along EDSA were a bane to both motorists and public commuters. Rather than serve the public, bus drivers went on continuous free-for-all scrambles to pick up passengers that resulted in massive bottlenecks wherever they piled themselves up across several lanes at every stop.
One wonders who Metro Manila really belongs to. The answer to that musing lies in how a blanket preferential treatment is given to private motorists and passengers who represent less than 20 percent of daily commuters. That statistic alone describes the institutionalised injustice baked into the Philippines’ infrastructure development priorities.
The prevailing picture of progressive cities in the advanced world is now a far cry from the look propagated in the mid 20th Century when cars were seen to be a key feature of “modern” living. Nowadays, in the cities of advanced societies, cars now cede thoroughfares they once dominated to pedestrians and trams.
The argument that the idea to dismantle the busway originally came from concerns that major rehabilitation work to be conducted on EDSA would require additional lanes to ease the resulting anticipated traffic congestion does not make sense, in any case. Public transport users should always be prioritised over private vehicles users. After all, use of public roads by private vehicles is a privilege, not a right or entitlement. The convenience of public transport patrons trump the interests of private vehicles users and, as long as public transport services provide reasonable alternatives to private car use, any outrage expressed by the latter should, at best, be taken with a grain of salt.",Others
COA Flags Inday The Red Tagger For Non-Compliant Satellite Office Expenses,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/coa-flags-inday-the-red-tagger-for-non-compliant-satellite-office-expenses/,"The Commission on Audit (COA) figuratively slapped the fat off the face of Vice President Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio for spending P668,197.20 in a manner not fully compliant with RA 9184 and its implementing rules & regulations.
Really, it is a small fraction of the P3,000,000,000 (Three billion pesos) she demanded for her office — which, come to think of it, has no other function but to wait for the President to die or get ousted from office.
A portion of the COA report tweeted by Rappler says, to wit:
Procurement not fully compliant Under RA 9184
8. The immediate establishment of OVP Satellite Offices (SOs) without enough equipment to operate led to the purchase of PPE and Semi Expendable Property totaling P668,197.20, not fully compliant under the relevant provisions of Republic Act (RA) and its implementing rules and regulations; thus, the purpose of the Procurement Law was not completely achieved.
To spare you from the bureaucratic language of the COA report, it appears that the OVP officers bought equipment for the satellite office using their own money and then got reimbursed for the expense. However, because it seems they lacked actual knowledge of COA requirements, the acquisition and reimbursement for the equipment failed to pass muster with COA.
To quote the pertinent portion of the report: “Although a quotation was attached, ensuring the lowest price was obtained in the market, the OVP’s failure to undergo these purchases in the processes and procedures required under RA 9184 and its IRR defeats the purpose of the Procurement Law, which is to standardize and to improve transparency in the procurement process.”
We must remember that similar instances of so-called “emergency purchases” were so rampant during the rule of Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio’s father, especially around the time of the COVID 19 pandemic.
It’s good that COA flagged the OVP for this transaction because, who knows where this kind of sloppy handling of government funds could lead to.
To give everyone an idea, let’s also remember the following controversies that exploded during the Presidency of Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio’s father.
1. The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) corruption scandal: In 2020, allegations of corruption emerged involving the misappropriation of funds meant for COVID-19 response. It was claimed that PhilHealth officials were involved in fraudulent schemes, such as overpricing medical equipment and approving fake claims.
2. The Department of Health (DOH) procurement anomalies: There were reports of irregularities in the procurement of COVID-19 supplies by the DOH during the Duterte administration. This included allegations of overpricing and favoritism in awarding contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies.
3. The controversy surrounding the purchase of COVID-19 test kits: In 2020, the government faced criticism for purchasing test kits at significantly higher prices compared to neighboring countries. The high cost raised suspicions of corruption and led to calls for transparency in the procurement process.
4. Red Cross COVID-19 testing kit issue: The Philippine Red Cross, a non-governmental organization, suspended its COVID-19 testing services in October 2020 due to the government’s unpaid debt amounting to millions of pesos. This raised concerns about the mismanagement of funds allocated for COVID-19 response.
5. Alleged involvement of politicians in the hoarding and smuggling of COVID-19 supplies: There have been reports of politicians, including some close to the Duterte administration, being involved in hoarding and smuggling COVID-19 supplies. This includes instances where supplies were allegedly diverted for personal gain rather than being distributed to those in need.

Having grown up in the Middle East, I was initially drawn to the Philippines for its vibrant culture, warm hospitality, and breathtaking landscapes. Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for this beautiful nation and its people, which has fueled my desire to understand and contribute to its political landscape.
Living here for three decades has allowed me to witness firsthand the country’s political evolution, from the turbulent times to the remarkable progress it has achieved.

VP Inday Sara’s Pork Barrel Fund: The P9 Billion Barangay Development Program,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/vp-inday-saras-pork-barrel-fund-the-p9-billion-barangay-development-program/,"One of the keys to winning the Presidency in the 2028 elections is to gain political control over as many vote rich areas all over the country and this IS the genius behind the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict’s P9 billion Barangay Development Program.
The barangays targeted for the Barangay Development Program are said to be former communist terrorist guerilla territories. Typically, these areas possess a big enough population that would support the needs of the communist terrorist guerillas such as food, money, and even warm bodies, i.e., recruits.
In the heyday of the armed communist movement in the Philippines, these areas were also known for delivering votes to whoever was able to cut a deal with the armed communist leaders. It is said that votes coming from these areas were comparable in number to those delivered by Iglesia ni Cristo and other groups touted to have “command votes”.
Even the likes of Vice President Inday Sara Duterte’s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, had to deal with these armed communists to get votes in order to perpetuate themselves in power.
These were so-called “tactical alliances”, but what it actually meant in practical terms could be many things for the communist rebels which could include generous pay-offs and even protection from the military forces that were after them.
The local politician “tactically allied” with communist rebels would not only be assured of votes but also a band of goons that would or could be used to kill off their rivals, squeeze businessmen for bribes, deter rivals in illegal money making schemes, and many such other things.
Now, with the death of Joma Sison and military claims to be the dissolution of the national leadership of the communist rebels, their territories as well as the people living in these territories are now within the clutches of Vice President Inday Sara Duterte — who was just recently designated as the Co Vice Chair of the NTF ELCAC.
At the beginning of this article, I pointed out that to win the 2028 Presidential election, you have to have as many vote rich areas under your control. Now consider the following about Inday Sara Duterte;
All in all, if Inday Sara Duterte wanted to control the results of the 2028 elections in these former rebel areas, she would already have several of the key elements needed: barangay officials, teachers, and officers of the Armed Forces plus P 9 billion which she can dispense as favors.
Peace be upon you!
