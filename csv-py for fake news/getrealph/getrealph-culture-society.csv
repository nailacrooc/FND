Similarities between Pinoy Culture and Wokeness,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/similarities-pinoyculture-wokeness/,"After examining the Woke phenomenon, I saw parallels between it and some Pinoy attitudes, especially the Pinoy Pride attitude. Get Real Philippines’ main theme for years is that the reason for the Philippines’ backwardness is its culture, and if some parts of the culture are similar to Wokeness, then no wonder. These are the similarities I observed:
1. Victim Mentality
I would call it “Pretend Kawawaness” as well. People can claim to be oppressed or victims when they actually are not. Wokeness is a claim by some people that they have special awareness of how oppression actually works (they are “woke” or “awake” so they could see it, others could not). They even claim that a person can commit oppression without realizing it, and it’s the Woke person’s job to detect and “correct” that. Some Woke people also claim to be oppressed themselves. Marxism, one of Woke’s sources, claims that being oppressed opens one to special knowledge, and this makes the connection of Marxism to Gnosticism not farfetched. Both Marxism and Woke propose having the “oppressed” overthrow the existing leaders to become the leaders themselves.
Filipinos at times do say they’re oppressed when they don’t get the hand-outs they want. I’ve also written about how Filipinos embrace brokenness as an identity and tend to refuse to be “fixed,” which is like Woke. They both use the image of “brokenness” to get what they want (pretend to be poor or poverty porn to get hand-outs). In Woke’s case, they use this image to get not only hand-outs but also power. Once given enough power, they would want their brokenness to become imposed on other people. The result will predictably be the breaking of the world, although this is after all the goal of Woke’s originators.
Another mindset that both Wokes and Pinoys share is that they see someone who is in a more comfortable state because of their own achievements as selfish and evil. So they believe that such people are oppressive and should be forced to hand out to those who were unable to have the same achievements (i.e., those who refuse to work and want to mooch). If they refuse, they should be brought down. They would explain that being superior in some traits or even just being different is oppression of someone else. This is a twisted understanding of reality and is also envy in operation.
2. Claiming to be “special”
“Woke” already has that concept of being special. Similarly, Filipinos like to think they are a “special people,” and the Filipino identity should draw special treatment, deference, adulations, and more from the rest of the world despite the lack of any tangible achievement. Add to that the tendency to ride on others’ achievements, such as saying we’re a great people when athletes like Carlos Yulo and Hidilyn Diaz earn medals. That traps Filipinos in a cycle wherein they refuse to take reasonable actions and steps to improve their condition.
Woke and Pinoy Pride are also similar in being prideful. While our pridefulness is in part a result of vanity-encouraging marketing, our own culture and even some government-sponsored “Pinoy Pride” initiatives also encourage Filipino self-projecting. Filipinos likely believe they need to project pride as a proof of life and as a way of coping with their relative poverty and desperation. However, this only highlights intellectual bankruptcy.
3. Opposition to Western Culture
Both Woke and some Pinoys like to blame Western colonialism and culture for their problems. The West is seen as an evil that invades “pure” societies and corrupts them, even if many life-saving advancements and improvements were actually provided by it. Anti-American sentiment isn’t new these days, I’ve seen how Filipinos displayed anti-English sentiments at the time I was a child. “Being Patriotic” for such Pinoys meant making an enemy of other countries and cultures even if they actually benefit from these.
Both Woke and Pinoy Pride Culture are also anti-individuality on the surface, meaning that humans are best subsumed as automatons for the “greater good.” I also see this as influenced by Asian culture, which sees people as gears or parts of a societal machine rather than individuals choosing to come together to help each other. I perceive this as one reason communism was more easily embraced in Asian countries (like China). Filipino culture also has traditions that predetermine people’s roles in life and deny self-determination. An example of this is parents forcing children to provide for them rather than depend on pensions or their own sources. Children having the quality of self-determination is even condemned as evil. Western culture upholds self-determination and seeks to limit determination by someone else, while also providing alternatives such as benefits for the elderly.
Woke also goes hand in hand with decolonization, which seeks not only to remove the effects of western colonization, but also destroy the civilizations of the colonizers. I see some Filipinos as having the attitude of decolonization, but without knowledge on how to do it – which I am thankful for.
So, by blaming Western cultures as enemies, Woke and Pinoys practice:
4. Painting as evil ideas or people that are not really evil
Woke is actually about reversing good and evil in a process called Dialectical Inversion. They lie about being for the “oppressed” and being inclusive, but actually ostracize or call Nazis or right-wing others who are unlike them or who block their path to power. This includes anyone who adheres to the normal, or “cis,” values, like valuing the family institution, that male and female are the norm for genders, sex changes are unnatural, sex is not to be introduced to children, people best work for what they want rather then be given hand-outs, and other things that are tagged as “based” in today’s world.
At least Filipinos still adhere to what is normal, believing in family values and such. Filipinos however still ostracize those who feel different and don’t agree with them, but the basis is more on traditional culture, which has its own problems. Filipinos still have their own double standards, such as claiming to be oppressed in another country when a local has an offensive name like Kiki, claiming to be oppressed by the world but wanting to be an empire, and people in government claiming to be against corruption but participate in corruption themselves.
Another similar aspect among the two sides is the belief that misfortune is always someone else’s fault. For Wokes, misfortune or even just a little discomfort in life is the fault of the West or white people, or whoever is in power (During Marx’s time, it was the Jews; you may not believe it, but Marx was anti-Semitic, even if he himself was Jewish). Wokes reject the idea of self-responsibility, that if you make a mistake where you hurt yourself, you can’t blame others. Basically, all pain and suffering are manmade (always by others) and do not occur naturally. Filipinos have a similar attitude, demonstrated in situations such as, when they encounter a problem, the first thing they would do is look for someone to blame rather than a solution.
5. Embracing of irrationality over Rationality
Wokeness hates rationality, logic, and common sense as these are pillars of Western culture, whiteness or whatever thing they consider the source of oppression. Wokeness, communism, esotericism, postmodernism and all associated ideas seek to recast the village simpleton as the intellectual. If they don’t make sense, that’s the idea; anything that makes sense is evil.
When it comes to irrationality, Jean Jacques Rousseau is one major source of postmodern ideas leading to Communism and wokeness. As I wrote earlier, Rousseau believed that primitivity – which tends to be highly irrational – was the real state of purity. He promoted that but if you bring modern societies back to this, paradise is regained. But in practice, it means destroying things and killing a lot of people. When Rousseau said, “man is free but everywhere in chains,” I believe he wasn’t referring to human governments; he was referring to reality itself, how difficult life is. He wanted to rebel against reality. How to rebel? Use violence, hold uprisings and destroy governments and societies. Despite his eloquence, Rousseau was just mad at the world and wanted to bring it all down. That is the same kind of mentality as a mass shooter’s and is the real mindset behind Woke.
Filipinos, on the other hand, tend to be primitive and irrational for different reasons, poor education and poverty being some of them. Filipinos tend to believe in magic and stuff. With their lack of knowledge of facts and science, they just assume dumb things. You can see that in idle housewives who think they run their house so well that they believe they should run others’ lives, someone who believes a bakery should serve him bulalo, or the village leaders who decide that a mentally disabled person is to be caged. We’ve also talked about Filipino anti-intellectualism many times in this blog. This goes along with the expressions of desire for the primitive or “old” ways that some Filipinos post in nostalgia sites. When traditional beliefs tend to have their own problems similar to Woke, I see irrationality and primitivism as a common source.
Filipino emotionalism is often discussed in this blog site. I find it ironic since Filipinos are mostly Christian and Christianity carries a lot of stoic ideas in the New Testament. One of the things that perhaps helped ruin it is liberation theology which was influenced by Marxism.
Also, Philippine society is highly fractious and tribal, which many have cited as one of the major problems that bog down the country. This situation adds to the lack of education and maintaining of backward culture. I would say though that our country’s backward tribalism might appeal to Rousseau (that makes it no surprise when the Communists go to the mountains to recruit the far off tribes). Woke is actually very tribal and seeks to fracture society.
6. Both dream of ruling the world
As I said, the ultimate goal of Woke is to destroy the world. But they realize that staying the rebel group will not work towards this purpose. They have to take over and get power so that they could more effectively bring about the destruction of the world. They likely expect to rule over the destroyed world and it will magically reform to become their paradise.
This is reportedly why some old fictional properties, such as Star Wars, Disney properties, Hollywood movies, science fiction literature, and comic books, are being infiltrated by Wokes. This is not just to use such properties to promote Woke agendas; I suspect the real goal is to destroy them. That’s because these fictional properties were used to promote western values. Subverting these properties to use them to promote Woke values is a side goal, if it was indeed a goal; but if the properties are destroyed, they cannot be used anymore to promote western, Christian, or other “oppressive” values. The same applies to academic institutions. Woke in the United States is what the CPP-NPA is to us; claiming to be the cure for oppression when it only wants to take control of the oppression and turn it in their favor.
I’ve seen some Pinoys express the desire for a Philippine empire. I think most other Filipinos themselves will scoff as such a thing, and I agree. I believe we not only don’t deserve empire, but are incapable of having it. Even if we become a more prosperous country, we’re sure to bungle it because of incompetence or other reason.
Unbridled immigration is yet another issue. Some say loose controls on immigration are part of the decolonization agenda. People from poor and violent cultures come in, they bring in their backward culture and cause havoc in the once peaceful western country. The idea of closed borders is to protect societies from destructive elements.
Next are my suggested solutions to each of the above.
1. Filipinos should stop thinking of themselves as victims of the world. Victimhood mentality is not just caused by political influences but is also a personal values and culture issue. The way to live should be how the response to terrorism was suggested in this blog, specifically to live life like you’re not affected by it. If Filipinos make mistakes that shoot themselves in the foot, they should own up to their mistakes. They should reject the projection of poorness as an identity (poverty porn) and pursue “fixing themselves” in life. They should accept the differences in the states of people’s lives and not demand that they be the same as others and vice versa. Stop thinking of someone being in a better condition as “lamang” (having an advantage by putting one over them) and instead work towards that condition on your own if possible; or, find your own place without being like another person.
There’s this video on Youtube which explains how even elites can think they’re oppressed.
2. Filipinos best drop the arrogance of claiming to be “special” in the world. Self-projection and pride seem like good ways to deal with our difficult situations, but they are more like obstructions to the solution (There is a way but seems right, but in the end leads to death – Bible). In my church, I once held a talk for youth about the problems of social media. I said that when they look for pride on social media, they are actually looking for dignity. But the foolish things people do on social media do not bring them dignity, but actually deprive them of it. In saying that, I make pride and dignity separate ideas. I understand some people see pride as necessary for self-love or proof of life, but I also claim that they are mistaken. Tangible achievements are the real proof of life. This might seem very stoic for most, but I believe this will lead to more meaningful self-esteem.
Also, I have written about LGBTQIA-whatever pride marches not being normal pride, as in self-value, but as a projection of power expressing a desire to take over. Even if the movement did not start out that way, it has been co-opted by other interests to be that way today.
Instead of demanding respect on basis of self-perceived and pride-based identity, it is best based on the principle that one must respect others by default because they are fellow humans, until they commit a wrongdoing.
And, one important thing to realize is that Wokeness itself, by claiming “specialness” in having the authority to tag others racist, is itself racist and chauvinist.
3. Support the good effects of Colonialism on the Philippines. I support the paper The Case for Colonialism by Bruce Gilley. Western individuality and John Locke, the basis of human rights, are what we are supposed to embrace. In fact, the human rights charter in our Constitution almost copies Western Traditions like the American Amendments and the United Nations Human Rights Charter. Wokes or Filipinos who want to decolonize the country should drop the Human Rights charter for consistency. Filipinos should realize that many other ideas that become their basis for criticizing the West, such as anti-imperialism, come from the West itself.
We must also push back against primitivism, whether it comes from traditionalism or from Wokeness. Going back to the primitive and eschewing technological advances will not lead to purity but depravity. As I said before, you cannot put “noble” and “savage” together. Degrading to a more primitive form of living will also lead to many deaths. But so the same, neither will I seek imposition of high technology or higher lifestyles on others. People should choose and work for it themselves. Also, primitivism is likely based on the erroneous assumption of the Bible that became commonplace, the image of Adam and Eve being Tarzan and Jane and Eden being a natural jungle. Recent scholarship that shown that this interpretation is wrong…  but that’s best discussed in another article.
Filipinos must defend individuality and push back against monistic views of society. We must also push against decolonization, because it only seeks to destroy societies and people and reverse all advances and progress that saves lives. Also, on the question of collectivism vs. individualism, we should not see these as opposites but two necessary components. We should come together to help each other live, but we are individuals first and that is the building block of our collective.
Take note that I’m not against preservations of cultural traditions such as some tribes’ dance, music, dress, food, art and such, and I respect the work of some people on this.
4. and 5. I think these go hand in hand because ideas on good and evil are connected to rationality as well as aligning more with Western ideals. Filipinos best drop anti-intellectuality, along with the view of intelligence as used only for putting one over other people. Rejecting Rousseau’s ideas also rejects irrationality, leading to embracing the real rational modernity where misconceptions are busted, tribal backwardness is overcome, and evidence-based practices are supported. We must also promote a culture that seeks to make intellectuality (the right kind, not the “Gnostic” or “best and brightest become rulers” kind) available for all, although this will indeed require improvement of our country’s formal education. Yet changes in cultural education through the family, community and other informal means is just as important. I also support the removal of liberation theology from Catholic teaching.
Aside from being careful of Woke reversing good and evil, we must also be critical of parts of traditional culture similar to Woke. For example, even under traditional culture, people will believe that their assumptions or “akala” can replace the truth. And if they are proven wrong, they go all Karen. Who knows if this was the source of Wokeness after all (“the false notion that… my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” – Issac Asimov). Culture and tradition are not sacred but manmade, so people should feel that they have the right to change these if they find it reasonable to do so.
6. Stop dreaming of ruling the world. No one can actually rule the world. Humanity is imperfect and fractious. No one can hold a really big operation and keep it running for so long. Empires fall, and so will a world when it is “united” using force. Filipinos should have no dreams of empire or being the “first-world hegemony,” because we are not capable of that and it is an unethical goal. Besides, we have anti-imperialism in our own Constitution – the state rejecting war as an instrument of policy.
Filipinos should develop a society that values self-responsibility and self-sufficiency and should stop highlighting their dependence on the big nations. This might be aptly applied to the situation in the South China Sea and West Philippine Sea, as the Philippines’ tendency to side with a bigger “bully” only emphasizes its weakness.
Conquering the Similarities
So am I saying Wokeness and Pinoy Culture are the same? No. Pinoy Culture is still traditional, but with flaws that stem from the irrationality of humanity. These similarities are for me the actual things keeping the Philippines from becoming a safer and more prosperous society.
Wokeness is not modernity but postmodernism, which actually tries to counter modernity and draws from the irrational parts of both tradition and esoteric belief. What is modernity? Getting to the right ideas and fixing dysfunctions with rationality. Get Real Philippines’ theme of promoting cultural change seeks to overcome the irrationalities of both Woke and traditional culture with rational modernity (which has mostly Christian elements as well), thereby paving the way for a society that honors its commitments and uses its human capital the right way (following esteemed Webmaster Benign0’s explanation of poverty and capitalism).
Wokeness and Pinoy Culture have parallels because people in different places and contexts can still develop similar ideas. Ideas, bad or good, have a life of their own. If we in the Philippines are not careful, Woke ideas can also infiltrate us and cause all the trouble that the US is experiencing now.
Wokedom disguises itself as modernity and sometimes as tradition, and you couldn’t figure it out until the effects have already damaged people. Woke practices can also be seen as backward traditions being resurrected in a new form, such as the idea that certain “enlightened” people in a village should take power and lord it over others. For example, there’s a video of this Woke session where African students (Fallists) suggested throwing out science and replacing it with witchcraft. These are among the things to resist.
I know my ideas would meet much resistance. But I’m also confident that many are realizing the nature of the problem and the ideas in this article will gain traction and help many people in the end.",Others
Jeepney “modernisation” (or stopping it) is Filipinos’ top New Year’s resolution,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/jeepney-modernisation-or-stopping-it-is-filipinos-top-new-years-resolution/,"Filipinos are ending the year — and starting a new one (duh!) — debating over a really big issue: jeepneys. What else, right? The jeepney after all is the quintessential Pinoy cultural icon. Why shouldn’t it be? It’s a perverted version of one of America’s greatest engineering achievements. Owing to their world-renowned Reverse Midas Touch syndrome, trust Filipinos to turn that to shit and make it a symbol of their “beloved” nation.
For most other southeast Asian nations, modern and efficient public transport is a foregone conclusion. To them, it is a public right that trumps any held by private motorists. You see it in how far the Philippines’ former peers in the region have come, turning their once teeming cesspool metropolises into the wonders of mass public mobility today. While other countries hold operators of their public transport facilities to the highest quality and safety standards, Filipinos reserve the most decrepit — most dangerous — of the lot to serve the greater majority of their fellow citizens.
Indeed, the biggest argument the Philippines’ traditional “activists” hang on to in defense of the jeepney infestation is that the drivers of these contraptions are “poor”. These parasites argue that these poor “public servants” cannot afford to install essential equipment in their vehicles that would assure the safety of their passengers and contribute to efforts to improve the air quality of their cities. Filipino “activists” are, in short, lobbying to give “the poor” license to be bad citizens.
While millions of Filipino commuters suffer on the roads of Metro Manila and many other Philippine cities, “activists” harp about the “livelihoods” of jeepney drivers — as if their collective “plight” is more important than the wellbeing and productivity of the majority. To put things in proper perspective, various sources estimate the the total number of jeepney drivers nationwide at about 200,000. Consider then that the total number of users of public transport in the Philippines exceeds ten million and it becomes easy to see the stupidity in the arguments of these “activists”. Why would they fight for the wellbeing of a community whose numbers are utterly dwarfed by that of parties vastly inconvenienced by this infestation?
Consider too that people who can afford — and therefore opt to use — private vehicles to get about Philippine cities also number in the millions. These are people that “activists” paint as “privileged” but the fact is, private motorists are also victims of the Philippines’ jeepney infestation. They share the road — and the lost time — equally with ordinary Filipino users. All — rich and poor — put up with the bad citizenship jeepney drivers and operators bring to the roads everyday.
Ending the year with a massive “debate” on the continued tolerance of the jeepney infestation proves just how small a country the Philippines is. Despite its enormous population and its accidentally “strategic” role in regional geopolitics Filipinos continue to exhibit their renowned heritage of smallness — a cultural curiosity that continues to hobble what should have been a proud march into the 21st Century.",Others
The Philippines’ SISSY culture has no place in today’s world,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/the-philippines-sissy-culture-has-no-place-in-todays-world/,"We should accept it. War shapes world history and, at the moment (for that matter, as with many moments in human history), armies are locked in battle — or rattling sabres — over differences in world view held by their respective heads of state and government. If Filipinos think that their personal belief in the goodness of their lot and the imagined righteous place in the world order they position themselves will save them from this most fundamental of human conditions, they are tragically mistaken.
Human history is a graveyard filled with the corpses of “world government” bodies such as the League of Nations (which failed to be of any consequence in the lead up to world War II) and today’s United Nations which is evidently sidelined as big powers lock horns across the face of the planet. Much as Filipinos would like to believe that their lot being on the right side of “international law” will save their asses from “evil”, the confronting reality is that they will need to be ready to fight a shooting war to save their sovereignty (or their “national pride” at the very least).
While the Philippines is now in the midst of an unprecedented arms buildup, the limpdicked culture that characterises the society it hosts persists. Rather than face force with a credible demonstration of resolve to use force where necessary in confronting Chinese encroachment into their territorial waters, Filipinos continue to apply mere publicity stunts to assert their sovereignty.
This limpdickedness bizarrely manifests even in their armed forces as Manila Times columnist Bobi Tiglao points out in his recent piece “Military, Coast Guard turning PH into world’s laughingstock”, writing how “when the Chinese […] defended their territory, fired water cannons to push away the Philippine vessels, and even undertook shooing-away maneuvers, our Navy and Coast Guard officials ordered their vessels around, beat their breasts and shouted, ‘US, help us.’ The Americans, of course, are secretly laughing at us.”
And of those laughable Pinoy-style stunts of late that Philippine news media “journalists” were all too quick to make headline news, Tiglao writes…
It was ridiculous for our Navy or Coast Guard to put a belen (depiction of the nativity with statues) on the bow of their ship as it planned to go to Ayungin. Did they think the baby Jesus Christ would get the Chinese to give up their sovereignty? It was a hilarious idea for this ex-communist, now-lunatic ex-priest Ed de la Torre to have planned to bring “Christmas gifts” to the platoon of Marines stationed on the rusting Sierra Madre. Did they plan to bring lechon, too? Look, ex-priest, the theatrics your commie groups used to stage decades ago no longer work; why can’t you understand that?
When will Filipinos understand that it is only through a strong military — and a visible wherewithal to use it — that a strong country can be built. Indeed, this was a lesson evidently not learned by the the “thought leaders” of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis who suffered a series of catastrophic defeats since themselves undertaking similar stunts.
Jeepney culture is what it is. Perhaps Filipinos see their military and all the new hardware it is acquiring as mere borloloy — quaint ornaments that are all for show but belie Filipinos’ empty “fight” rhetoric. Form will not save the Philippines. Only substance will. It’s time Filipinos build the substance to match the form they strut around with.",Others
Besmirching “Dictators’ Supporters” has Backfired,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/01/besmirching-dictators-supporters/,"This is the very mistake that dragged the “opposition” down. When they see people voicing support for the Marcoses, Duterte, Trump or other perceived “dictator,” they would attack, insult and besmirch such people, accusing them of being “trolls.” They think by insulting or libeling “dictator’s supporters,” they are doing something good. The opposite is true. By besmirching such people, they might actually be lying about and destroying them, something that more appropriately deserves the description of “evil.”
Photo courtesy of ABC Australia
The problem with their method is that not all “dictator’s supporters” are trolls. In fact, a great majority of them are real people. Thus, the “opposition” ends up libeling real people.
Another mistake is to equate the supporters to the dictators themselves. Meaning, if the dictators are suspected of or even known to have killed people, supporters are called murderers themselves. That is false equivalence. One is only a murderer if they do the act.
The reason why Duterte or Marcos, or even other dictators (such as Syria’s Assad), have become more popular is not trolls or online propaganda. They are popular because there are real people who approve of them, who share their ideas by word of mouth. Old people who believe they experienced easier lives in older days will associate that ease with the leader of the time, as is the case with Marcos. Tell them anything like they have Stockholm Syndrome, Dunning-Kruger effect or similar, they’ll rebuff you and call you the troll. And at times, they may be right in the latter.
The “opposition’s” method of demonizing anyone who supports the “dictators,” as well as lumping other people who disagree with them into this group, earned them the scorn of the people. It also means they are trigger happy; they just attack and attack, doing opposition for its own sake. But if that’s all they do, and you don’t see them really helping people, they are indeed trolls. Seeing them getting attacked by the people they attacked first is just receiving their just desserts.
As much as you want to “rebuke” supporters of dictators, rebuking isn’t a good way to approach them. Perhaps there is a gentler way of rebuke, but calling them trolls certainly isn’t going to work. The effect is that it will embolden them to support their dictator further, because they see attacks on who they support as malicious against society as a whole (contributing to the antifragility of the one they support).
What opposition should do is focus on improving the lives of people, including the lives of “dictators’ supporters.” In doing so, they prove their sincerity if they claim to be “for the people,” and are offering a real alternative. If they leave out the “dictators’ supporters,” then it proves that they do not really care about people and are not the “good guys.” They are politically colored and vindictive, and care about their political dominance more than anything. This is demonstrated by the recent turnaround of communist leader Renato Reyes, who after years of being Anti-VFA suddenly supports it simply because the guy he “opposes” has become anti-VFA.
One other problem with the “opposition” is that they focus on personalities and not ideas, showing their intellectual bankruptcy. They are focused on the “evil personality” of Duterte, but good and evil are not dependent on personality. As if the personalities they support are not “evil” themselves.
Also, people don’t really care who help them. They care about receiving help, whoever it is. They are people with needs and if they perceived that “dictators” provide for their needs, they will hang on (case in point: the number of people who flocked to the funeral of the slain “Jaguar” drug lord). And yet another thing: remember that “dictator’s supporters” don’t see the one they support as a dictator.
The “opposition” has a lot to change if they want to regain their ground in the arena. But it may also mean completely changing the foundation of their stance – which is likely wanting to oust “dictators” and changing the ousted with their own. If they don’t, they might permanently get the image of “enemy” – and deserve it.",Others
Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Ball and Chain in the Old Oak Tree,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/tie-a-yellow-ribbon-on-the-ball-and-chain-in-the-old-oak-tree/,"I’m comin’ home, I’ve done my time
Now I’ve got to know what is and isn’t mine…”
The people has spoken and punctuated it with rage that drove the final nails to the coffin of the Yellowtards’ political dreams. A seething anger to be exact.
It has been the goal of the Yellows-turned-Pink for six years to use anger that supposedly will come from the electorate, to use it against Duterte and all the remnants of the strongman Marcos Senior’s regime.
But unfortunately for them, that rage they were trying to incite in the people against the government backfired. They’ve realized (albeit a bit too late) that they’ve already alienated the very ones who they want to be on their side. And they’ve waken up into the nightmare that they were already dealing with:
Engaging the toxic Yellow army head on was futile, so the ordinary voters figured. For who can withstand the constant vitriol and all the personal attacks?
And so the people just waited for the perfect moment for redemption: May 9th 2022.
They know fully well that it’s the perfect opportunity to say the F-word and “screw you” in a civilized and democratic way.
And that, they did with finality and emphasis – 16M times for the presidency and 21M times for the vice presidency.
Finally, the “bobo” and the “tanga” electorate as the Yellowtards relished to name the people outside of their echo chambers, finally had a new meaning to the old song symbolizing LP’s return to power:
Now the whole damned bus is cheerin’
And I can’t believe I see –
– the Yellowtards and Pinklawans met with a hundred yellow ribbons round the ball and chain that’ll be tied to their feet in the ole oak tree,
never to rape the lands again and be free.”",Others
Gigantic murals of Leni Robredo are DISHONEST stunts that insult the intelligence of Filipino voters,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/gigantic-murals-of-leni-robredo-are-dishonest-stunts-that-insult-the-intelligence-of-filipino-voters/,"Opposition “leader” Leni Robredo is now moving her campaign into new territory with big murals depicting her image beginning to adorn exposed building firewalls. Rendering these images are “volunteers” only too quick to jump at chances to signal to the public their abseiling prowess. The calls for volunteers to contribute to this effort come across like calls to join some sort of holy war.

What’s up with the size of these works? Is it to ensure high visibility and maximise eyeball retention? Could it be to inspire awe and veneration? Could these also be monuments to the awesomeness of the presumed volunteerism that supposedly characterises Robredo’s #KakamPink campaign? Evidently it is all of the above. One is reminded of the zeal with which artists from antiquity all the way up to recent times would scramble over one another to paint and sculpt their gods and idols for their greater glories.
One need look no further for examples of disturbingly similar works of art motivated by such cults of personality. These are tools for the sorts of myth-making the Yellowtard bloc of the Opposition are particularly known for and, as seen today, hopelessly rely on to prop up political profile that is devoid of both substance and authenticity.
The larger than life and idealised depiction of the subjects and scenery in these murals aim to evoke the sort of emotional response that burns narratives into the long-term memories of those who view them.
Do these stunts contribute to making voters better-informed and more intellectually-equipped to make the required decisions in the lead up to the coming elections? Very unlikely considering that these stunts constitute no more than appeals to emotion and not much else. After all, what is it about Robredo’s qualification to lead a nation of more than 100 million that could possibly be learned from a gigantic mural? Indeed, one does struggle to learn anything even from the speeches Robredo delivers that were crafted by her handlers to make her sound smart. What more from a picture, right?
Filipinos need to see through these dishonest stunts that aim to hijack their cognitive facilities to a “cause” that is bereft of any substance. Putting up murals that beg to be looked up to in awe is not the campaign style of a candidate or party that supposedly espouses modern democratic ideals. True democracy requires an electorate that applies modern thinking to making those important choices its members are expected to make in participating in this important exercise — not a brainless fandom that bows to idols painted on concrete walls by a bunch of virtue signallers.",Others
How can we envision a “new Philippines” when “being Filipino” remains a problematic idea?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/how-can-we-envision-a-new-philippines-when-being-filipino-remains-a-problematic-idea/,"A “new Philippines” cannot be achieved by merely singing some blurb every morning. Proof of this is in how even the basic principles of the Panatang Makabayan (“Patriotic Oath”) had failed to embed in the Filipino psyche despite several generations of Filipinos being made to recite it in the morning. Without a foundation of “love of country” or, at the very least, a clear understanding of what it means to be a “true Filipino”, any further effort to build anything “new” would be like building a house on a sand dune.
Consider the closing statements of the oath:
Sisikapin kong maging isang tunay na Pilipino sa isip, sa salita, at sa gawa.
Translated: “I will do my best to be a true Filipino in thought, word, and deed.”
That statement merely begs the question: What characterises Filipino thought, word, and deed? Answering this question demands careful thought. Subjecting this question to a street survey will likely yield unsurprising responses: Filipino time, unreliable, untrustworthy, and dishonest among other things. Indeed being Filipino in thought, word, and deed isn’t exactly regarded as aspirational.
So now Filipinos are required to contribute to building a “new Philippines” — for starters by a new hymn every morning, Bagong Pilipinas. The message of the song revolves primarily around putting the Philippines first; choosing “our own”, fighting for country, working hard, and upholding honour. In short, Filipinos are invited to embrace being Filipino.
We see how problematic this is in the context of the shaky foundation upon which we are encouraged to regard a “new Philippines”. If we are to believe that all it will take to envision this “new Philippines” is to embrace what it means to be Filipino, we run into the disturbing core of why Filipinos fail to change for the better to begin with. It is because Filipinos’ ingrained notion of “being Filipino” is, itself, profoundly flawed.
It seems that the “new Philippines” envisioned by the government is one where Filipinos love who they are and, on the back of that, become protective of what they love. The reality, however, is quite the opposite. Love — of country, specifically — is premised on promise. What is the Philippines’ potential considering it is not quite a great country yet. Note the emphasis on the word “yet” there. That, itself highlights a confronting assumption — that the Philippines holds potential to be a great country.
There is work to be done. It will not involve coming up with fluff to stuff Filipinos’ morning flag ceremonies with. Work needs to be done to build things of substance — tangible stuff to substantiate promise that the Philippines could be a great country someday.",Others
I Guess Pinoys Consider Themselves A Football Nation Now,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/09/i-guess-pinoys-consider-themselves-a-football-nation-now/,"Like I said in a previous entry, pinoys are overjoyed over what they perceive as world football relevance. First appearance in the World Cup , first goal and first win.
To quote my favorite singer/ songwriter.
If I might intrude
Just for a moment
If only to inject a note of reality
On this festive occasion
All those “milestones” were singular. They got 1 win in their group, scoring one goal while allowing 8. Only team in the group with a negative goal differential. Finished last. I feel I have to say that because pinoys by nature do not follow football enough to understand the standings.
Well as we love to ask here in GRP ” What is next?” Don’t look now but in less than 2 weeks the ladies have 3 matches in the Asian games (Sept 22 -28 Asian Games,). As I write this there is now a new boss to guide the ladies as they have something they did not have before: expectations. Did Alen  Stajcic get out because this job was merely a stepping stone? That’s the beauty of a culture with low expectations. You score one goal and get one win and you are a “miracle worker.” Even if he did think this is as far as you can go , he would never say it pubicly. You may have witnessed the zenith of relevance of so called pinoy football.
It was Stajcic who told you :
“I don’t really care where they’re born, if they have Philippines in their heart and in their blood, and they’re good at football, then they’re eligible for our team. They all play for their flag, they all play for their country, they all play for the people in the Philippines, wherever they reside. I just know this team has Filipino heart, and blood, and courage, and spirit.”
I love how an Australian whose team shuns local players that were born and raised here is telling a local audience what playing for the flag is all about. Telling all of you who know the national anthem and crave lechon what constitutes “Filipino heart, blood , courage and spirit.” Where was that courage and spirit when he left the team before the World Cup was even over?  So much for him defining what Filipino spirit is. Oh wait he jumped on another bandwagon so quickly. He might be more pinoy that I thought. You are so quick to believe a fly by night mercinary on what it is to be Filipino.
I was happy with the response of the GRP entry I released shortly after that sole World Cup win. Some people got my point and two others were very vocally against my views. The detractors thought they were attacking me hoping to shut me up , they just gave me more fuel for another volume. The people who argued with me just proved my point that  I was making. They are OK with: 1) no work locally regarding soccer 2) locals being excluded 3) Enjoying the fruits of the labor of the American institutions.
I wrote my last piece asking the key question: why do pinoys relate to this team so much? I did my best to back up any claims I had with research that was available to me. The local federation was not a good source of information as I detailed in my entry. One major red flag for those so attached to this ” team from the Philippines” : headlines screaming that 18 of the 23 women on the final roster were out of a Bruce Springsteen song. That should have been their entrance music when they played in New Zealand.
Allow me to shed some light on the other five who did not escape the womb only to be initially cared for in one of the 50 US states ( mostly California):
Let’s get the one real product of the Philippines out of the way. Anicka Castaneda born in Mandaluyong and played as a young adult for DLSU. Anicka never stepped between the lines during gametime .  If you watched every minute of the World Cup , you would have seen as much of her as someone who didn’t have access to a TV or the Internet. It only goes downhill from there.
What makes Ms. Castaneda the anomally in her group is she actually spent time in a classroom in the Philippines. She was the only one out of a team of 24. She is the exception not the rule .  She only left the Philippines to represent it as opposed to coming here for the first time as an adult. The woman on the team with the second strongest ties is Maria Meryll Krysteen Rosales Serrano. She was born in Pangasinan but she learned about life and sports in Norway. She was first officially in the Philippines in a soccer capacity at age 25. Angela Beard was born in Australia and played almost all her soccer there including their national team. She was persuaded to switch to the Philippines quite recently. Sara Kristine Bantan Eggesvik was born in Norway and spent her entire football career in Norway , except for her time on the Philippine national team. Jaclyn Katrina Sawicki born in Canada , educated in Canada, pro career in Sweden , Japan , Australia .
I learned a lot interacting with my detractors. They insist ” we are the same blood”. What good is that? Do I have to spell it out? We already know that 18 of the 23 women were American born . I found no cases where both parents were Filipino immigrants. Most of the cases it was the mother who was of Philippine descent. They were not even necessarily born in the Philippines. Why that is important is let’s break down the importance of Filipino blood. In 18 of the 23 cases on the ” Philippine ” women’s team : the sperm is American, the egg is of Filipino descent, the hospital is American, the elementary school is American, the playmates are American, the coaches are American, the fields are American, the soccer ball bought in an American mall, the diet is American, the high schools are American and the universities are American. Where is the “pinoy” input?  Most people are OK with this since the pinoy values pansin more than doing the work to getting the pansin.
Anyone who remembers anything about high school physics will remember the equation:
work = force x distance
The word “work” as used in physics has a narrower meaning than it does in everyday life. First, it only refers to physical work, of course, and second, something has to be accomplished. If you lift up a box of books from the floor and put it on a shelf, you’ve done work, as defined in physics, if the box is too heavy and you tug at it until you’re worn out but it doesn’t move, that doesn’t count as work.  If we use the framework of physics then , how much work did the Philippines do to get these women in shape to go on the world stage?
Now that you have a better idea how little the Philippines has to do with ” their team in the World Cup”, I just want to dig a bit deeper into their roster selection:
Kaiya Jota was born in California and first got to the Philippines age 16. She is now 17 . She will go to Stanford not La Salle not Ateneo . Malea Cesar ( 19 years old) born in California and has been part of the Philippine team for only a year and she is a semi professional player in Australia. Isabella Victoria Sola Flanigan is only 18 and played high school football in Florida and she is going or will go to West Virginia University in the US. Isabella Pasion is the youngest of this group who was 16 at the time of the World Cup She is still in high school and was listed as a reserve. I am not telling you this because these ladies are not even old enough to drink in a bar in the US. I am telling you this because stock piling all these youth imports shows you the PFF has no intention of developing anybody born and developed locally. They seem to looking everywhere except the Philippines for their talent.
Kaiya Jota as mentioned earlier is only 17. I talked about Filipino football ignoring the people actually born here and looking at them as sub human when it comes to women representing this country. There is also discarding the ones you already had under your tent. Inna Palacos born in Manila and played for CSA Makati and DLSU. She was good enough to be in a local VISA commercial  but not good enough to keep a 16 year old off the roster. She is the poster child of this wave of casting aside  the locals for the imports. This wave born out of the thirst for pansin.
Another paradox I love to hammer home whenever Gilas or the Azkals inevitably come up short is the “leftover ” theory. Other teams that beat the snot out of Gilas are not playing their country’s favorite sport. Gilas brings in an import because it is already an admission that homegrown Filipinos are not enough. Any import on the roster will close the opportunity for a Filipino who actually cared about representing his country his whole life. Any import who cares enough to represent the Philippines I guarantee you was not close to making the team of the country he or she really belongs to. This applies to both Gilas and the Azkals. You are taking the court / field with players who are not in demand by the best in the world. So being competitive with the best in the world is just a fantasy. I still have no idea why pinoys really expect relevance abroad with soccer when almost none of them make the sport relevant locally.
There was one woman on the World Cup team who was born in Mandaluyong. The rest only came here to play soccer. They did not come here because they love Edsa. They didn’t come here because they thought it was an honor to be on noontime shows. They came here because every athlete faces sports mortality. There will come a time they will not be relevant as an athlete. Lot of high school players experience that. The roster of women that qualified for the World Cup only became citizens of this country not because of love of this country or even residency in this country. They became citizens to prolong their relevance in their sport. They did not qualify for the US team where they rather be so why not the consolation prize? They are playing for the Philippines because they had no choice. Actually there was a choice. Not play in the World Cup. I know you are all proud to be pinoy. The jury is still out if you are proud of work pinoys actually did.
I was talking to a Chinese man who is in China via video chat and talking about his favorite subject- football . He was so proud that his team qualified for the World Cup and did not have one American. He laughed that Filipinos were so quick to accept a Filipino team with no Filipinos who were born and raised there . I did find out later there was one but only after a lot of digging. There are some countries that rather succeed or fail with their own players they developed and would never put up exploiting a loophole to have a roster of foreigners. Then I remembered that Filipinos spent so many years bending over to colonial masters. See the difference? Filipinos hate China being aggressive but lack the means to do anything on their own and have to run crying elsewhere for help .One country is the intimidator and the other can not do anything about it on their own. Do you see a relation?
Look at the local culture. Look at local values. None of it screams world class soccer. I will tell you what it does scream: credit grabbing, chest beating, false pride and jumping on the bandwagon. Local media screams baduy. Baduy is something that the local audience  wants  to aspire to. If that was not true then Vice Ganda would not reach as many households as he does. No way on God’s green earth are  world class soccer players are coming out of this culture. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. You are not good at soccer locally and yet you embrace soccer glory in the form of the Philippine flag in a woman’s jersey even if the wearer of that jersey has so little in common with you. Representing a country in an international compeition among countries  is supposed to be an honor and a privelege reserved for those who toiled all their lives inside that country wanting to represent that same country. Instead we have mercenaries  and leftovers getting by on technicalities.  Is morale in this country too dismal to produce our own representatives? You have to import people who did not grow up in the Filipino environment with the constant messages the streets and noontime TV bombard them with. You have to go to countries that support and encourage more than one team sport. If our environment is such a handicap , do we deserve to play to play with the big boys/ girls? They seem to get their environment together.
One of the biggest selling albums of all time is Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors. Dreams was the only single off the album to reach #1. Of course a few generations later some people believe that Dreams is a Coors song. The signature line of that song I believe is ” And have you any dreams you’d like to sell?” . When the curtain went up in NZ/ Australia the Philippine flag was there. Yes the dream of pansin was achieved at the cost any semblance of pinoyness. The dream of pansin achieved while selling away any hope of any local women representing the country they were born and raised in. Pinoy culture that celebrates “our girls” without questioning the lack of our girls in the program are complicit in the selling of that dream. Hope they are happy setting up a club so exclusive that locals are not allowed in.
Like I said earlier , there was only one win and one goal scored in the World Cup and at what cost? What true hope does a local athlete have when pinoys are so intoxicated with this pansin without any real work from the locals?? Maybe somebody in the local press is asking this question but I doubt it. Nobody in local sports media wants to be a fly in the ointment of pansin. I have to quote Angola’s coach in the recently concluded FIBA tournament.
“We can sign an import like most of the national teams and maybe we’re gonna score more 3s,” Canals said. “But I don’t believe this is correct, and I really think that FIBA must stop this as soon as possible.
“Otherwise, in some years, there will be no local product. Each country needs to develop their own players. This is what I think.
“There are players that don’t even speak the language of the country that they represent. There are countries which have seven, eight player that were born outside that country.”
That same article considered Jordan Clarkson as naturalized. The same Clarkson who pinoy fans treated like he was another man with the initials of J.C. He was the NBA talent surrounded by PBA talent. What message are you sending local athletes that they are not welcome or will be treated as inferior tokens? Can it be more obvious than that? Locals are not welcome. The Philippines has zero interest in developing their own players when it comes to soccer and I am not sure that is something to be proud of.
For me there is a disconnect. This country did not learn how to play soccer well overnight. The country can not produce soccer players. They recently turned a blind eye to anyone born here. Which is discrimination no matter how you slice it. To wear the Philippines kit in New Zealand and step between the lines  you can’t be born in the Philippines? You get a local born goal keeper good enough to be in a VISA commercial only to replace her with a 16 year old? That makes sense only in the Philippines. I am the pinoy sports conscience.  I am the defacto national sports honesty broker.  I am not blinded by KSP . I have spent decades on this earth enjoying sports where pinoys have no impact. Sports will go on without homegrown pinoy involvement and ironically the local soccer federation by not even considering local talent is seeing to that.",Others
The Real New World Order,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/real-new-world-order-teichrib/,"I recently began following Christian author, scholar and speaker Michael Heiser, whose work I find revolutionary and makes the most sense about Christian doctrine. He has an interesting Youtube channel called Fringepop321 where he tackles ancient aliens, UFOs, Bible analysis, cryptozoology, the occult and all the weird stuff from a Christian perspective.
But among Heiser’s videos, what got me writing were episodes where another Christian author, Carl Teichrib, was his guest. One of those episodes had the words “New World Order” in the title. So I watched, and what a revelation it was to me.
Teichrib agrees that the New World Order I described in an earlier article, the secret society-manipulated thing, is a caricature. And, as I suspected, it covers up the real New World Order, something that is in the open, something that people may not find sinister at first, but it is when you get to the bottom of it.
Teichrib related that he had been going to New Age conventions to learn about their ideas and use the chance to evangelize. He had been to the various iterations of the Parliament of World Religions, for example, where representatives from all faiths converge. Christians, Bahai, Buddhism, Hindu, Shinto, modern pagans, Wiccans, Maharishi, Sufism, Satanism, occultists and even Ayahuasca attended these. He also described other organizations, including non-governmental organizations and special interest groups such as the World Federalist Organization/Citizens for Global Solutions. The goal of the group as claimed is world peace.
So what’s sinister with this, you may ask? They’re coming together and working for peace! The problem is that they want that peace achieved on their own terms and not anybody else’s, and this could degrade into something that undermines people’s freedoms.
First, Teichrib said that this group of world religions doesn’t stop at religion. Their consensus is that world peace is possible only by establishing a world government – likely one that they are the author of. In other words, they want to cross over from religion into politics. They want to establish their own order on the world, a New World Order under themselves. Teichrib called this spiritual politics.
Those involved want things like a world taxation system set up, payable to their government. And, wouldn’t a world government have tussles with sovereign nations? That leads to another point, they want to bring down the sovereignty of nations. It sounds attractive to “peaceniks” at first (I’ll admit it appealed to me before too), but it actually has more consequences than benefits in practice.
Teichrib’s website is named Forcing Change, which is a good way to put what the religions parliament wants. He also lays bare his biases: embracing an evangelical Christian perspective; pro-liberty versus politically imposed equality; pro-individualistic versus consensus collectivism; and pro-free market. I embrace the same things as the better path to true world peace. But these are also the areas that are threatened by this new world order.
Despite the participants being from different religious backgrounds and the claim of being tolerant of all beliefs, Teichrib hints that the actual goal is make all people accept one belief, which is Monism or Oneism. This is the belief that all is one and everything will eventually merge back into one mass. The likely expectation is that all belief systems will soon merge into one, so the parliament thinks, let’s speed that up.
I believe this expectation is wrong. This is because belief systems have elements that conflict. If I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior, should I also accept Buddha, Tammuz and Rhonda Byrne as my saviors if the parliament says so? Some religions take narcotic drugs; so should I be forced to take the drugs just for the sake of acceptance? What if another religion says taking narcotics is wrong? Problems like these should be obvious even when people don’t try to look at it closely. These and many other things are good reasons for Evangelical Christians to refuse to join.
Here’s something interesting: during a meeting in the 2018 parliament that carried themes of Love and Inclusion, a progressive baptist minister (yes, some Christians get misled) put together a Hindu sand mandala (a sort of sand painting) of the goddess Kali holding up a severed head of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and of people who confirmed him following his nomination to the US Supreme Court. Then the minister and other members proceeded to dance around it in a sort of cursing ceremony and they destroyed the representations of Kavanaugh and the others. Again, the event’s theme was Love and Inclusion. Yeah, right. I agree with Michael Heiser’s reaction, it is disturbing.
Next, politically imposed equality. As the mandala episode suggests, the parliament is dominated by left-leaning people and social justice warriors or SJWs. So you can expect people twisting ideas of justice here.
For example, when the Bible says, let he who has two blankets share one with an unfortunate fellow without one (or, for the Philippine context, someone with two electric fans), the SJWs will twist that into, patrol the houses and find someone who has two blankets. Forcibly take one and give it to someone without. And, there are sure to be some SJWs who will just take one’s blanket and give it to someone else (perhaps on the basis that the one with the blanket is purportedly rich and the other poor) – which means things are still at zero and someone still lacks a blanket.
In Teichrib’s own example, he says during a 2010 world religions summit, a Salvation Army representative proposed that instead of allowing each person to have their own bike, make them share one bike in the community (it’s in the LDBC 2019 video). That, Teichrib said, was tried in Venezuela, Russia and Eastern Europe and did not work.
What happens when socialism actually gets applied so fervently is that redistribution becomes middle-class to poor, not rich to poor; but the rich steal the credit for it. The rich actually stay rich despite redistribution policies, simply because they’re in control. Also, redistribution-based ideologies don’t solve the patron-client culture of poorer countries (like ours), but actually help maintain it. The rich as patrons use redistribution and poverty porn to keep their clients as clients. This would also be against the free market ideal listed above.
But we know that such ideas find their way into the Philippines. These are ideas that Filipino wokes, such as those among the anti-Duterte crowd, hold. And yes, even among Christians and Catholics. The statements a while back of Leni Robredo and Socrates Villegas on vote-buying seem to reflect such influences. Of course, there’s that observation that the social justice agenda of the local Catholic Church, perhaps even “liberation theology” in the Vatican itself, reflects infiltration by pagan humanistic and leftist ideas (I recall the ridiculous “no to war toys” movement before, which I believe had its origins from outside Christianity).
Next, pro-individualistic versus consensus collectivism. Monistic ideas seem to imply that, since we are all supposed to be one,  human free will can be called an aberration. Some people want to break down the natural, God-endowed individuality that people have in order to make them part of the oneness. According to Teichrib, group members have expressed the intention that, if people in the world don’t embrace their ideals, they could use force. Of course, why else are they trying to transition to political control?
So some will ask, what’s wrong with you? Who cares if some rights are trampled on. that thing is for peace! But it’s forced peace, which is oppressive. In effect, it’s not peace at all. It will lead to persecution of people who hold on to their beliefs, which is a basic human right. It should alarm those who value liberty.
It’s both interesting and alarming that politicians and former world leaders attend this. Former Canadian prime minister Kim Campbell attended. Hillary Clinton also sent a letter when she couldn’t attend. I also saw anthropologist Jane Goodall and Queen Rayna of Jordan listed in a report. Al Gore’s daughter Karenna attended the 2015 parliament and afterwards went on to promote climate change stuff at Paris. Members of the group are among the staunch supporters of the Carbon Tax and similar environmental efforts, so I’ll not be surprised if Greta Thunberg or those close to her are involved. Come to think of it, Teichrib says some environmentalists at the parliament want humanity to worship the Earth as a goddess. Christians might be told to go along with it, and if they refuse, political strong-arming may be used against them.
So with this, I think of Maria Ressa. She was granted the Nobel Peace Prize, but what she does is actually challenge the sovereignty of the current Philippine government… Hmm, Peace through challenging sovereignty? Could there be a connection between her and the parliament of religions? It’s possible that some wealthy people attend the parliament and are encouraged to use their funds for initiatives that undermine the sovereignty of nations and the rights of people who disagree with them. That’s why I believe the idea of George Soros, Pierre Omidyar or other businessmen funding efforts to overthrow governments is not far-fetched. Teichrib also mentioned connections with the International Criminal Court, which intends to try President Rodrigo Duterte for purported crimes.
I believe that, in the Philippines, a community of similar people is already working their way into politics to try to make into policy politically imposed equality, anti-individualistic consensus collectivism and anti-free market views. Then resistance to these will also be branded as being a racist, fascist, dictator, or whatever pejorative normally lobbed against “evil people.” This is terrible to put in a world government.
I remember that my church’s founder, Herbert W. Armstrong, used to parrot that a world government was also the way to peace. But instead of being under humans, Christ, a real divinity, is the one expected to run this world government. I of course believe that this is better. Humans are not suited to rule the world.
Like I said about communism, strong centralized control in the hands of a few flawed people is susceptible to serious mistakes, the worst being deaths. For example, most plane crashes have been traced to human error. Some pilots with issues even crash planes deliberately, bringing loads of people with them. What if you find people like these in a world government, in charge of millions of people? This sounds like a nightmare. This is also why the powers of consensus over individuals should be greatly limited.
The underlying theme of this Monist movement as Teichrib implies is the same as Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret that I discussed before: that humanity should not worship any god anymore and should declare itself as god. But, for me, this is one of the sources of, not a solution to, the world’s evils. What this movement seems to be doing is making a sort of exclusive club, whose members believe that the world should be populated only by other people who think like themselves. They want to remake the world into their own image. Or they believe their ideas are so “good” that others must try them. Those who refuse or have different ideas are “evil,” so these must be dealt with and not tolerated. Since they’re after political power now, things may go beyond just making a mere sand mandala or effigy and reach the point of institutionalized discrimination, having someone jailed on trumped-up charges, or even worse.
If you think I’m scaremongering or badmouthing others, Teichrib said he had been receiving threats from members of the group. I haven’t read his book Game of Gods, but I’m sure all that information is there. This is something that people who value their liberty need to be wary of and be ready to resist when the time comes.
You might say, perhaps there are people who are sincere in that parliament about doing good? Yes, I believe there are. Teichrib himself could be considered one of them. But I also believe such people walk out from meetings when they disagree with what members of the parliament propose (Teichrib in one of the videos linked below tells of when he and another Christian walked out of a heated meeting). Those who stay are likely the people who’ve compromised their values just to go with the crowd.
For me, no hegemony, school of thought, ideology or whatever thing that is humanity’s creation should rule the world. That includes whatever the parliament I described is pushing. They claim that it is for peace, but I find it misguided if they are resorting to political power to enforce it.
I also disagree also with Monism. Everything is not one (even if that is a famous line from Transformers the Movie). For me, merging consciousness like the Eternals’ Uni-mind and losing our free will as a result is a farce. It also doesn’t make sense – we have free will at first, then we lose it later? I prefer evangelical Christianity because it recognizes that we are individuals (Rom. 14:12, each of us makes an account of ourselves), each of us a “one” that has a responsibility to one’s self as well as others and God. And when people help others under this condition, rather than under forced redistribution, it is more sincere and helpful. Peace is more peaceful when individuals freely embrace it rather than get forced into it.

The Fallacy of “Special Problems”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/special-problems/,"The wokes tend to see certain social problems as “special problems.” It’s based on the idea that certain problems deserve more attention than others. For example, poverty in a slum town in a South American country, or hunger in a certain part of Africa. Or, as some woke Filipinos desire, many people in this country getting killed from drug war-related events, and calling this as a reason to overthrow government – which is stupid. Other “special problems” are climate change, which Greta Thunberg infamously had a tantrum on, or the Australian wildfires. They want to call other people to help on these, and those who don’t help, they attack as “evil people.”
I disagree with that, of course. Attacking other people is nothing more than fake moralization. Really, if someone is not with you on wanting to “save the world,” why attack or shame them? Often, the answer is that such an attacker is a troll or shill.
It’s also because there’s this false value going around, that if you “rebuke” or “call out” someone doing something “not good,” you get brownie points. The problem is that you can make a mistaken “call out,” mistaking something good as bad. Or, something is bad to you, and you want to convince others to change their opinion and agree with you, don’t expect instant success, especially if you’re trying to force people (like convincing someone that Duterte is a tyrant – sorry, that’s not a universal truth, if truth at all).
The people who coin “special problems” are likely the ones who are so comfortable and spoiled in their modern society, that when they see others in a “less fortunate state,” they become alarmed or offended that they want to do something. That sounds good at first. But some end up not knowing what to do. They might send money carelessly, dictate interference in that “special problem” place, or, as stated above, attack someone who they assume is related to it. Or they “like” or share things on social media, assuming it will help. And the results are either floppy or backfire.
The fallacy that such people hold on to is that their way of life is the standard for all. So when they see others in a “lower” state of life (even if it is not really lower), they will try to impose their lifestyle (and their woke values) on those people. But that is arrogance and stupidity. Imposing your “modern lifestyle” does not guarantee improvement in the lives of people. Can the other people maintain the western lifestyle imposed on them? Is it economically viable for them? Do they agree with the different values of the lifestyle? It is more complex than most think.
People who identify “special problems” also tend to think of themselves as special. It’s intellectual arrogance. Certain “intellectuals” identify a “special problem,” and these “intellectuals” want everyone to follow their way. They end up being dictators. So they try to attack others, trying to make it look like they’re heroes, but end up being revealed as trolls. Such is the case of Raissa Robles.
One other obvious issue is that “special problems” imply special treatment, with the risk of taking attention off other problems, such as insurgencies, crime (especially drug-related crime) and freeloading.
This view also tends to be spurred by childish idealism, which is great for noticing problems. It’s easier to notice something when you’re emotionally triggered. But solutions require a more sober, less emotional, reason-driven approach. For example, on Australian wildfires, a woke person may call, “let’s get together and put out the wildfires!” But seriously, no one can do that.
Saying problems are not special does not mean opposing any solution. That is the strawman that troublemakers will accuse me of. They are all still problems that need to be solved. The question here is how to approach solving them.
As I explained before, the nature of problems is local. In my piece on climate change and environmental concerns, I said the problem of trash is best solved by the locals, instead of a group from another country dictating them what to do. Even if some “international” efforts have good ideas, imposing the solution is the worst way to implement it. You have to ask nicely and not force locals to do what you want.
The same goes for wanting to impose carbon tax on pollutants. That measure will likely create more problems than solutions since it is a broad brush-painting method that will ignore specific situations and conditions of different people.
Poverty, disease, hunger and many other problems have always been problems because they occur naturally. Racism is among the products of human efforts to survive. They are not special problems in any sense, and don’t have greater priority over others. Giving aid has been a popular method, but even after so much aid is given, the problems are still there. Efforts to provide aid in Somalia, for example, led to the infamous Black Hawk Down incident. Aid stopped, probably because there was a realization that it wouldn’t work in the long run.
Getting all people in the world to do the same thing, to move together at once to be on the same page, to unite on something – that sounds good on paper. But in practice, it is a pipe dream. People have natural differences that they can’t compromise, because they need these differences. People don’t always need to move together, sometimes, they need to move differently, because that is what works for them. And think of it this way: if someone wants to to impose their ideas on the whole world, whether on peace or beauty or anything, aren’t they becoming a dictator? Someone calls for unity: whose kind of unity, yours?
The solution to “special problems,” or any problem you might discuss, is what I’ve been saying: helping yourself is still the most important kind of help. That is what empowerment is all about. You empower people by helping them become self-sufficient, or able to solve their own problems. If efforts are still focused on giving hand-outs, they won’t solve the problems at all. Many problems are created by or kept unsolved by entitlement. The end of entitlement is perhaps the best solution for any problem, special or not.",Others
Why is there no P- or F-pop? Filipinos still in denial that theirs is a country of low standards!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/why-is-there-no-p-or-f-pop-filipinos-still-in-denial-that-theirs-is-a-country-of-low-standards/,"Every now and then I re-share an article I wrote some time back, “Regine Velasquez is ‘Queen of Song’ in a country of low standards” just for fun, and every time I get the same rabid responses asserting the contrary. That Velasquez was crowned “Queen” and that the belief that she is “Asia’s songbird” persists remain baffling artefacts of the Philippines’ performing arts scene. There seems to be no evidence to support these lofty credentials Filipinos grant their local stars.
Like much else, reality checks on Filipinos’ oversized sense of worth abound. There are objective ones backed by hard data — their country’s place in a ranking of countries by average IQ, GDP per capita, number of rock stars per 100,000, etc. One such set of objective facts lies in a comparison of work ethic. Beholding the rise to global prominence of Korean pop culture, many Filipino opinion shapers lament the lack of a similar trajectory of achievement in their own country’s performing arts. But do Filipino performers really have what it takes to be world class?
Some insight into what it takes to play at that globally-competitive level is provided in Boo Chanco’s PhilStar piece “Could there be a Pinoy BTS?” where he shares thoughts on the matter provided by Lisa Guerrero Nakpil, former manager of Filipino band RiverMaya…
I have studied this for several decades ever since the Korean juggernaut first reared its head. BTS is just the FINAL/latest flowering of South Korea’s efforts.
This is grounded on the following:
1. Long term planning: cultivation of talent over a 10 to 15 year horizon. Talents are picked, trained from ages eight to 12 and kept in almost military boot camps.
2. Support of government in creative industries – tax breaks, travel, training.
3. Korean people’s own character of hard work and perfectionism.
I’ve had to perform with a Korean boy band and they do not quit, they keep rehearsing and working.
I’m not surprised. Not at all accidental
Therein lies the confronting answer. Nakpil spelt out the essential three criteria behind the success of the Korean K-pop juggernaut that are collectively anathema to Filipino culture. The Philippines, after all, is a society where even the thought of citizen military training — a practice quite normal in many countries — would send activists on shrill indignation campaigns. Compound that with a lack of foresight, a deficit in imagination, and a bankruptcy of originality and you get the mediocre landscape we see today in the Philippines’ entertainment industry.
Filipinos think success is necessarily an outcome of luck and the graces dispensed by a god. Societies with strong traditions of excellence and track records of achievement will beg to differ. This is something that warrants refection on a national scale.",Others
"Label yourself a DDS, BBM, or Yellowtard supporter and you lose all credibility as a writer",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/09/label-yourself-dds-bbm-or-yellowtard-supporter-and-you-lose-all-credibility-as-a-writer/,"So now we’re seeing another catfight raging between one camp of “bloggers” and another. Big fucking deal. It was all inevitable. These bozos were once best friends for life. Now they are sworn enemies.
See, this is why we at GRP don’t make friends with fellow bloggers. The minute you do, the sooner your freedom to write whatever you want gets compromised. There’s more to life than blogging and that means one necessarily has a life outside of the blogosphere that is inaccessible to ordinary members of our audience. The blogosphere is just a place to express ones views. I don’t see it as a place to make friends.
This is why Get Real Philippines persists as the one and only real objective blog outlet on the Philippine social issues landscape. It’s because we’re not in this space to make friends or form alliances. Why are we here? We’re here to invite people to prove us wrong. And guess what: so far, nobody’s stepped up to that challenge.
We’re in this for the pure intellectual pursuit. We’re here to test concepts. We’re not here to worship people. We’re here to stand by ideas. As the late former US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was said to have said…
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
The only real way one can come across as stupid in a debate is to declare one’s loyalty to a cult of personality as a credential of some sort. Since when has being a Dutertard, Marcostard, or Lenitard been a basis for determining how right or wrong someone is? Only in the Philippines, it seems. The fact is, “you’re wrong because you’re a Marcos supporter” holds as little water as “you’re wrong because you are a Duterte supporter”. Camps that spend the bigger chunk of their time doing deep “investigations” into how rabidly-loyal (or disloyal, for that matter) one or the other bozo is to their cult leader are all dens of intellectual bankruptcy.
So where does all this leave the Philippine blogosphere? With not much. Philippine society has long been known as an intellectually-bankrupt cesspool. World IQ rankings substantiate that fact, the dismal state and priority placed on public education proves it, and the quality of Filipino social and political blogs mirror this confronting reality.
So why is it so hard for Filipino “thought leaders” to come across as anything more than stupid? Maybe it’s because they talk about people a lot. Coffee in my Coffeemate, cereal in my milk. Makes sense to me.",Others
Is there still hope of turning the Tagalog dialect into a modern intellectual medium of communication?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/is-there-still-hope-of-turning-the-tagalog-dialect-into-a-modern-intellectual-medium-of-communication/,"Back in the old days, televised news reporting used to be mostly done in English. The EDSA “revolution” changed all that. Practically overnight, Tagalog news shows such as pioneer shock “news” caster Noli de Castro’s TV Patrol turned what was once a public service into mass entertainment.
Key to this was the pivoting of telejournalism to Tagalog as its medium of verbal delivery — something that the ABS-CBN network took lead of. Soon, TV “news reporting” devolved into an outlandish perversion — replacing the once-sober themes of many news programmes into the industry equivalent of jeepneys. News shows like ABS-CBN’s Bandila were assaults on the senses with news readers acting more like horse race barkers and studio sets awash with colourful digital animations.
Can one really argue that news reporting in the Philippines evolved for the better after it had been Tagalog-ized and jeepney-ized? It’s a hard sell. Trust in mainstream media is at an all-time low today. To be fair, it is not all accounted for by its Tagalog content which effectively points the “service” towards the market’s lowest common denominator. The Internet and the democratisation of self-publishing also contributed to mainstream media’s slide to irrelevance. However, in the Philippines, this already-dismal downward trajectory was made even steeper by the use of a dialect that further dumbed it down.
Indeed, using Tagalog in an intellectual discussion is like joining a gunfight armed with a knife. It does not help too that many Tagalog speakers who are uncomfortable with English suffer a deep insecurity to begin with. After all, how often do the most plum jobs on offer cite “proficiency in the Tagalog dialect” as a critical highly-regarded skill? As a result, Filipinos who are uncomfortable with the use of English (perhaps because it wasn’t taught well in the Philippines’ public schools) consistently find it difficult to compete with exclusive private school graduates who were enrolled in said schools (despite the back-breaking fees their parents had to fork out) precisely because they promised an ingraining of that much-coveted Arrrneeow twang (if it still exists, that is).
Most important of all, most useful media products are delivered in English; or, for that matter, delivered with the languages of societies that boast strong traditions of scientific, technological, and engineering achievement.
Sounds like a chicken-and-egg conundrum, doesn’t it? How can the Tagalog dialect be intellectualised if its speakers lack a strong intellectual tradition? This brings to question the amount of public resources invested in the continued sustaining of Tagalog’s place in the country’s education system. Does this dialect enhance the marketability of its speakers? Ask the same question about the English language and it becomes easy to see where precious scarce capital needs to be allocated towards the enhancement of Filipinos’ collective intellect.",Others
Marcos Day represents the Filipino people’s moving on from a manufactured past,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/marcos-day-represents-the-filipino-peoples-moving-on-from-a-manufactured-past/,"When a small minority of “activists” continue to encourage Filipinos to latch on to the past and sustain a pathological anxiety about the future, you know there is something wrong. Even more wrong is when these shills conspire with Big Corporate Media to propagate their sick “cause”. Today’s Inquirer editorial, for example, cites, interestingly enough, two communists to try to convince its readers that a “bill declaring a holiday in the province of Ilocos Norte to commemorate the birth of former president and ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos” constitutes a “desecration” of history.
Actually, to lend some ascendancy to that pompous statement and title of his piece, the Inquirer Editor makes it clear that he merely echoes the words of the communist and Bayan Muna “representative” Eufemia Cullamat whose precise words were that the move was a “big desecration of our history”. And perhaps to score additional Woke Bingo points, all this, the Inquirer Editor shrieks, is but the “latest repugnant attempt at historical revisionism”.
Next, the Inquirer Editor cites Etta Rosales who is “chair emerita of the party list Akbayan and former chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)” as someone who “knows whereof she speaks”. But of course. Rosales was, after all, a “political detainee during the martial law years”. As expected, anyone who was in prison during those years is automatically a “hero” and some sort of revered authority figure on all things to do with “human rights” which, we Filipinos have been indoctrinated into believing, is anathema to anything to do with Marcos.
The national butthurt these Martial Law Crybabies want to keep all Filipinos mired in goes to such extent that it does not occur to the Inquirer Editor himself that the words of a bunch of communists do not, in any way, represent the broader opinion of the Filipino public. Indeed, this latest fluff piece that panders to the obsolete howls of these crybabies is yet another case of minority opinions being cherry-picked to further a dishonest agenda. This is the very sort of behaviour that contributes to the now-observed progressive loss of trust in the credibility of Big Corporate Media “journalism” by the public.
Filipinos would serve themselves well by stepping out of the clunker that is the communists’ butthurt over “The Martial Law Years” and look to a future of possibilities. Rather than be trapped in a sick Cold War era rhetoric that continuously drums in what Filipinos should not be, we should start creating and embracing thinking around what we could be. Enough already of this perverse Martial Law Crybabyism the communists would like us all to be forever stuck in!",Others
The Noble Savage needs to be Buried,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/noble-savage-buried/,,Others
Why the Yellowtards and communists failed to incite mass outrage over Duterte’s birthday lechon,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/why-the-yellowtards-and-communists-failed-to-incite-mass-outrage-over-dutertes-birthday-lechon/,"The monumental huffing and puffing over lechon (roast suckling pig) being served during a dinner to celebrate Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s birthday at his home in Davao City seem to have all just emanated from members of the Philippine Opposition. Despite all that shrill noise, this most recent outrage fad they aimed to create seems to have fallen on apathetic ears. One would think that portraying the president as a tone-deaf tyrant who turns an insensitive eye to the “plight” of the Philippines’ “poor” as he feasts on the country’s favourite fiesta dish would incite the masses to take to the streets to vent their indignation.
No such thing happened of course. Street “revolutions” — the Yellowtards’ favourite wet dream — are so last century. Thus it is quite curious that this habit of the Opposition (who are led by that bloc of partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquinos and Cojuangcos) of trying to portray presidents who are not of their political camp as uncaring “tyrants” persists. The easy explanation to this is the evident stubbornness of the Opposition’s foremost “thought leaders” and the penchant of their community to cloister themselves in social media echo chambers. Their gods are those hashtags they and their choirs of titas and amigas succesfully “trend” on Twitter and their idea of winning a laban (fight) is to succeed at mass reporting “trolls” (which they define as pretty much anyone who disagrees with them or challenges their beliefs). No surprise then that learning and improving is an ongoing challenge for them.
Duterte’s lechon incident was likely seen by the Yellowtards as their “let them eat cake” moment — Marie Antoinette’s legendary utterance that supposedly launched the French Revolution. The trouble with the Yellowtards is that most of them are members of Imperial Manila’s chi chi private school and gated community set — “activists” who try to be in solidarity with “the poor” by pretending to be “among” them. Ironically, their biggest ideological failure is presuming to see the world from the eyes of “the poor” they hardly understand. This is due to a huge disconnect between what the rich and educated consider to be outrageous and what real poor people get angry about.
Indeed, stop to think about it for a moment. It is really the rich who are the ones who have a bigger problem with poverty than the poor. They are forced to live in fortified residential enclaves, hire 24-hour armed security guards, and carry around guns to protect themselves from the poor swarming around them everyday. The poor cramp the style of the rich too. That’s clearly evident whenever there is an international conference coming to town and the screens and fences come up around sections of roads and bridges between the airport and hotels and convention centres where delegates congregate lest they see the squalor just a stone’s throw away from their airconditioned cars.
It seems, therefore, that what is really at work whenever the Opposition wax outrage over shows of decadence is a deep-seated guilt over the way privilege is woven into the fabric of their lifestyles in the Philippines. Their mistake is in regarding Duterte’s lechon birthday meal from this lens.
The easy way these chi chi Yellowtards could have corrected their flawed understanding of how “the poor” think is to simply watch the masses’ favourite TV shows like Eat Bulaga and It’s Showtime, study the way megastars like Sharon Cuneta and Kris Aquino gained their mass following, and examine why, despite megabucks spent on an unneccessarily lavish televised wedding, celebrity couple Marian Rivera and Dingdong Dantes continue to be adored by their fandom. The Yellowtards need to get it into their heads that the Filipino masses don’t really see a problem with ostentatious displays of wealth. Rather, they are actually fascinated and entertained by it.
The Yellowtards and their communist comrades are being seriously misled by their self-righteous presumption to feel “outrage” and express it on behalf of the poor. The reality is that the poor and the rich in Philippine society co-exist like participants in a graceful tinikling — collectively engaging in an intimate dance that involves expertly tiptoeing over the constant clap of “social issues” that Manila’s “activists” seek to amplify unnecessarily. This dance is an otherwise practical coping mechanism to keep a social order that these “activists” aim to disrupt as part of a persistent agenda to create the chaotic environment they need to launch their crooked “revolutions” and seize power illegally — even to the point of resorting to violence and terror as a means to achieve those ends.
There is cause, of course, to instigate social change and build the more egalitarian Filipinos aspire to. Turning simple birthday dinners into outrage fads is just dumb and does not contribute to that end. The Yellowtards need to find a smarter way to remain relevant in Philippine society — for their sake.",Others
This year’s EDSA “Revolution” commemoration is gonna be an awkward one,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/this-years-edsa-revolution-commemoration-is-gonna-be-an-awkward-one/,"So February is just around the corner which means the date that the Yellowtards and communists anticipate in the same way normal people anticipate Christmas is fast approaching. The 25th of February is regarded by “historians” as the date when the so-called “revolution” that, we are told, deposed Ferdinand Marcos “altered the course” of Philippine history. According to a 2016 entry in the Official Gazette, the spectacle “showcased to the world the remarkable resolve of the Filipino people” and “heralded an era of peace.”
Now that another Marcos had been elected to the presidency in the biggest majority vote since that “revolution”, one wonders now how Filipinos will regard this event. It is, indeed, quite awkward considering the son of the man painted as “evil” incarnate by this EDSA narrative is now in power and the beneficiaries and propagators of this narrative have been all but disgraced politically. Indeed, in no less than three national elections, the collective Opposition led by the Yellowtards and their communist allies suffered humiliating and catastrophic defeats. In short, the rise of Bongbong Marcos alone did not doom the Yellowtard-Communist Axis. The previous two national elections long before had already delivered the writing on the wall for them.
Even if the Second Marcos Presidency did not materialise, the EDSA “Revolution” had already been long dead in the water. The historical record since 1986 is pretty damning. At a fundamental level, the Philippines remains the same country it was before that “revolution”. There was nothing truly revolutionary about that whole circus in 1986. The same power structures remain entrenched in Philippine politics and business. The same tiny elite clique of families still rule the islands. The same sorts of disasters still kill tens of thousands of Filipinos. And the same armed homicidal terrorists roam the country’s mountains and jungles with impunity. Dependence on the remittances of the country’s vast army of overseas foreign workers is growing. And the economy is propped up more by consumption and asset bubbles (both fuelled by these remittances) than by real industrial capacity.
Worse, the political “debate” remains framed by personalities rather than ideas. Partisan camps remain rabidly loyal to politicians regardless of the political parties they associate themselves with. Indeed, political parties are no more than quaint scams in Philippine politics as none of them represent nor remain consistent with any big principles or ideologies. As a result ideas crucial to development goals often fail to blossom from the concept stage because said ideas rise or fall not on their merit but on the personalities these happen to be associated with.
So now Bongbong Marcos is in power. On top of the fact that the EDSA narrative is obsolete, the fact of a Marcos being in power promises to make commemoration of this event nothing short of a cringe fest. Perhaps it is time Filipinos downgrade this event from its position as the Christmas of the Yellowtards and Commies. Time to evolve. Time to move on. Time to transition to a more intelligent political discourse.",Others
Martial Law Crybabies feeling validated by mention of Imelda Marcos in Netflix’s ‘The Crown’,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/martial-law-crybabies-feeling-validated-by-mention-of-imelda-marcos-in-netflixs-the-crown/,"Philippine Opposition Netizens are abuzz over the mention of Imelda Marcos’s shoe (or shell) collection in an episode of the fourth season of Netflix series The Crown. The scene features Princess Margaret (played by Helena Bonham Carter) describing a banquet she attended in Manila wherein she is approached by then First Lady Imelda Marcos who wanted to show her shoe collection. The princess is portrayed by Carter acting confused as to whether Marcos referred to shoes or to “shells”.
The scene shows Princess Margaret in the company of Queen Elizabeth (played by Olivia Colman), Prince Charles (played by Josh O’Connor), Princess Anne (played by Erin Doherty), and Prince Philip (played by Tobias Menzies) all having a chuckle about the incident.
Here is an account of Princess Margaret’s visit to Manila in 1980 that the scene is likely to be referring to as described by The Royal Watcher on its April 2020 article “Princess Margaret in the Philippines, 1980”…
Princess Margaret was hosted by First Lady Imelda Marcos on her Official Visit to the Philippines on this day in 1980, on behalf of the Queen. After visiting the tomb of national hero Jose Rizal, inaugurating the Lungsod ng Kabantaan hospital for children and viewing locally made handicrafts, the highlight of the visit was the Official Dinner in honour of the Princess (wearing the Poltimore Tiara and the Teck Circle Necklace) at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, which was followed by a visit to the the United Nation’s Indochinese Refugee Camp and a Reception at the British Embassy.
Imelda Marcos continues to be a celebrity in the Philippines. Back in 2014, photos of students of the Ateneo de Manila University posing for photos with Marcos circulated over the Net provoking outrage amongst her haters.
It’ll be interesting of course to see how the communists, a key ally of the Yellowtards (the leading partisan bloc within the Philippine Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan), would react to this latest “trending” piece of Martial Law Crybaby collateral. This is in considering that the English royal family are also anathema to the communist “cause” which seeks to destroy not just all aristocratic dynasties but any national government that they do not directly control.
In any case, much creative license is applied to the production of every episode of The Crown so it remains debatable as to how much of this scene (if at all) actually played out within closed doors.",Others
"Philippines, the sick man of Asia “again”? No. It ALWAYS HAS been sick!",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/philippines-the-sick-man-of-asia-again-no-it-always-has-been-sick/,"Certain “thought leaders” are issuing shrill commentary on the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns aimed to mitigate its effects. The fact is, most if not all countries are suffering from economic crises in varying degrees thanks to the brittle world order of intricately interdependent and interlinked economies created by “globalisation”. Amateur economists of the sorts that write for “social news networks” like Rappler are dishonestly painting the economic plight of the Philippines in absolute terms rather than regarding it in relative terms by comparing it like-for-like.
It is true, indeed, that much of what the Philippines had gained economically over a period spanning more than ten years had been undone over just the last couple. The Philippines had performed worse relative to other countries because it does not have sound economic fundamentals to begin with and much of the economic achievements trumpeted by successive governments in the first two decades of the 21st Century are labour-added-value in nature — Filipinos working in factories funded by foreign capital, Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), and work outsourced to the Philippines by rich countries. Much of the economic activities that create employment in both big cities and rural areas are tethered to foreign funding. Break those tethers and the whole house of cards fall. This is essentially what happened when the world went on lockdown. Those whose economies possessed true substance did relatively well. Those that depended on said substance trickling down to their gaping mouths suffered more.
As much as has been made about the “miracle” that was supposedly the Philippine economy over the 21st Century leading up to 2020, the sad fact is that the Philippines, at its core, remains very much Third World.
* * *
(1) It is a country that populated way beyond any inherent ability of its society to sustain their numbers.
Philippine society’s indigenous technological capability cannot, by itself, sustain its people’s aspirational standard of living. Something as basic as committing to sustaining the enormous population Filipinos find themselves stuck with cannot be honoured to the standard most Westerners and northeast Asians enjoy. This leads one to the question of why Filipinos committed to such an enormous population to begin with. Said population had become a liability rather than an asset in this regard if seen from the context of Western standards of living.
(2) It built an economy composed of unsustainable industries and propped up by consumption.
The Philippines is no more than a consumer market. Filipinos simply spend their money and spend their days finding ever more creative ways to convince themselves how much they deserve to spend their money on the latest trinket or gadget.
In that kind of a market, what sorts of industries is the Philippines likely to attract under a hypothetical regime of unfettered access to foreign capital of the sort preferred by foreign governments and investment banks? Most likely this: industries that will further grease the pipeline that channels cheap manufactured goods from highly-capitalised economies to the living rooms of increasingly impoverished Filipinos. Filipinos, in turn, will increasingly fund these purchases with the same old labour-intensive solutions — working overseas and working for the factories and retail outlets that manufacture and sell them these trinkets.
(3) Filipinos did not build a capital base that serves as a stable store of economic value and a foundation that provides a soft landing in times of economic crisis.
Despite the Philippines being host to abundant natural resources, and now, an enormous supply of people, the society as a whole lacks a collective ability to apply this enormous number of people to the task of turning these resources into any sort of valuable economic output of consequence. Instead, natural resources are harvested raw and sold raw — mineral ore, logs, overseas foreign workers. Overseas, these then get turned into iPhones, karaoke machines, those shirts with the Philippine islands embroidered onto their left breasts, Honda Civics, Havaianas, and Starbucks tumblers after which they are shipped back to the Philippines to be purchased using OFW cash.
There is no real equity at the core of such a society’s economic house of cards. There is nothing in the Philippines beyond the muscle of its workers that is worth buying. When demand for labour vanishes, Filipinos are left with virtually nothing. No world-class business assets and brands to sell, no safe and pleasant (much less interesting) cities and countrysides to offer to European and Japanese backpackers, no lush forests to pitch to researchers and eco-tourists, no world-class cutting-edge indigenous technology and scientific achievement to fall back to and build upon from scratch if necessary. Nothing.
(4) Its people lack an ethic of self-reliance ingrained in their cultural fabric.
Despite the Philippines being a democracy with a free market economy, its “thought leaders” see the poor as exempt from the expectation that everyone be equal participants in the free market. Whereas “well-to-do” people are expected to compete and account for their own success or failure, poor people are considered to be people who need to be given a break — given a break from taxes, given a break from complying with the law, and even given a break for being stupid. Indeed, if the poor are regarded as subject to the same rules the middle classes and up abide by, the jeepney would long have been consigned to a museum, squatters would have long ago been scraped off public land, and certain crooked showbiz celebrities and politicians accused of sexual misconduct and rebellion thrown in jail.
Self-reliance and an ability to chart one’s own path and develop original ideas is what underpins success in today’s world. Rather than wean Filipinos off reliance on the ideas of old colonial masters, the Philippines’ foremost “thought leaders” remain adamant in sustaining the debilitating colonial mentality that had long been a cornerstone of Philippine society’s edifice of dysfunction.
* * *
In short, there really should be no surprises around the dysfunctional manner with which Filipinos managed the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. They routinely don’t fare well when it comes to routine natural calamities such as the garden-variety tropical cyclones that visit the islands every year. Even basic infrastructure like public transportation had been left in a decrepit post World War II state well into the 21st Century. So, guess what, it really does not make sense to be expecting much of Filipinos when it comes to risk mitigation and disaster response — and certainly no surprise that the Philippines’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be counted as among the worst in the world.",Others
Filipinos like COMELEC commissioner Rowena Guanzon are threats to democracy and Philippine progress,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/filipinos-like-comelec-commissioner-rowena-guanzon-are-threats-to-democracy-and-philippine-progress/,"Filipino Netizens became witness to irrational behaviour on social networking site Twitter from Rowena Guanzon, Commissioner of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) after she went on a bragging spree because “trolls” annoyed her. She referred to herself as a “senior” Commissioner in a desperate attempt to get some respect after she made a series of cringe-worthy posts.
Guanzon’s mini-meltdown started when she expressed her condemnation of Police Master Sergeant Daniel Florendo for shooting and resulting in the death of retired army corporal Winston Ragos. Ragos was stopped for allegedly violating quarantine protocols in Quezon City and was shot twice after he threatened to pull a gun on the police officers. Guanzon was of the opinion that there was evidence of premeditation and that Florendo planned to kill Ragos from the beginning: The intent to kill was present. That and two shots were fired. Sa first shot immobilized na si Ragos. Why fire a 2nd shot?
Whether she is right or wrong about her presumption is beside the point. The point is, when people challenged Guanzon’s point of view, she went a little crazy. Her succeeding posts overly emphasised her position in the COMELEC. She couldn’t stop reminding people who she is.
(Links to tweets respectively: 1, 2, 3)
She followed those tweets with challenges to lawyers to debate her but said only lawyers who graduated from the University of the Philippines (UP) or Ateneo law schools are worth her time.
(Links to tweets respectively: 4, 5, 6)
To be honest, I felt sad for the Filipino people after reading her posts. While she is not the President of the Philippines, Guanzon does hold a powerful position in government. As Commissioner of the COMELEC, she has the power to apply election guidelines strictly or loosely depending on whose side she is on. Case in point was during the 2016 Presidential Elections. It was Guanzon who let slide the Liberal Party’s violation in submitting their statement of campaign expenses (SOCE). In an earlier Get Real Post article, we highlighted how current Vice President Leni Robredo’s running mate and Liberal Party presidential candidate Mar Roxas as well as the Liberal Party itself failed to meet the deadline imposed by the COMELEC on the submission of their SOCE. Section 14 of Republic Act 7166 stipulates that this is grounds for barring any winning candidates nominated by the LP from holding office. All Liberal Party candidates then including Robredo should have been disqualified for failing to meet the deadline.
Four COMELEC commissioners including Guanzon predictably voted to allow the extension of the deadline of submitting the SOCE, which eventually allowed Robredo to hold office. Like I said in my previous article about the issue, the COMELEC broke its own “final and non-extendible deadline” rule. The agency showed ordinary Filipinos that rules can be broken when you are connected to the right people. The Liberal Party’s connection to the COMELEC came in handy, indeed. It’s no secret that Chairman Andy Bautista was the losing Presidential candidate Mar Roxas’s former campaign adviser when he ran for senator in 2004. Bautista is also a close ally of President Benigno Simeon Aquino having once been the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG).
Some people have highlighted Guanzon’s own connection to the Liberal Party now that she is in the spotlight. Apparently, she was appointed Mayor of Cadiz City, Negros Occidental by the late former President Cory Aquino. She was also appointed by another Aquino, former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino, as commissioner to the Commission on Audit (COA) in 2013. One can be forgiven for saying she owes a lot to the Aquino family. She doesn’t hide her partisanship in her posts on social media. Her ties to the Liberal Party are dangers to the country’s democracy, indeed.
According to her bio, Guanzon came from an affluent family. Some of us wouldn’t have guessed that with the way she behaves on her video blogs and by reading her posts. She’s quite fond of using words like “shunga” — Filipino gay lingo for stupid. It’s not the word itself that is the problem, but it was the way she was saying it. No amount of showing off her wealth or bragging about her so-called education can compensate for her lack of class and breeding.
Guanzon repeatedly exhibited disgraceful behaviour on social media. Her attitude is a remnant of the so-called Aquino legacy. She was so full of herself. She was very discriminatory. She perpetuates elitism. Instead of promoting an egalitarian society, she promoted a hierarchical society where people of low status are not given a voice. This was evident when she dismissed law students who didn’t graduate from UP and Ateneo universities. These are not the only law schools in the Philippines. Guanzon clearly looked down on people outside of her circle. Yes she’s the type of person who asks people, “Don’t you know who I am?”
People in powerful positions should be promoting humility and grace instead of pride and arrogance. The attitude of Guanzon is part of the reason Philippine society is dysfunctional. As long as people like Guanzon are in control of government agencies that hold the key to democracy, not much will change. The voters will remain disenfranchised. That is a guarantee that the country will remain backward.",Others

The demise of ABS-CBN will herald a mass media renaissance in the Philippines!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/the-demise-of-abs-cbn-will-herald-a-mass-media-renaissance-in-the-philippines/,"If the community of content producers, artists, and creative types would care to pause a bit and step out of the herd mentality that is the lunacy of their “solidarity” with embattled ABS-CBN, they will see the vast opportunities that await their craft with the demise of the Philippines’ biggest mass media empire. For so long, ABS-CBN has loomed over the Philippines’ entertainment industry as an enormous reservoir of degenerate content that all but drowned out small independent producers that would have invigorated and substantially enriched Philippine entertainment had they been given access to a level playing field.
It is baffling the way the artists’ community are rallying behind ABS-CBN. For decades, ABS-CBN served as a major roadblock to injections of fresh blood into mass media entertainment. It had made use of uncompetitive practices to prop up its bankable but utterly mediocre talent and used its connections with an entrenched political-industrial complex to maintain its monopolistic hold. By flooding the market with a steady supply of cheap entertainment products, ABS-CBN kept downstream media distributors and theatre chains fat and complacent and unwilling to give space to smaller independent artists and producers.
If anything, freelance and independent artists and performers should be celebrating the disappearance of a major hurdle to the Philippines’ long overdue creative renaissance. Without the market flooded with the slapstick humour of Vice Ganda, the brain-dead bleached girlshows of Kim Chiu and Coco Martin, and the template plots of the McMovies churned out by Star Cinema, Philippine mass entertainment stands a chance of developing into the smarter, edgier, and more sophisticated scene of the sort that could compete with the international-grade products of Korea and China.
The Philippines’ creative scene is literally having the life of it sucked out by big corporate media outfits like ABS-CBN. For the likes of ABS-CBN, entertainment is manufactured rather than created. It regards sees art a business rather than a craft and aims to make the most money from the lowest common denominator. If there is one thing that is holding back the Philippines from taking its place amongst the world’s great outlets for talent in the performing arts, ABS-CBN would be it.
Rather than be all crybaby about the demise of an agent of creative degeneracy, independent Filipino artists and producers should be stepping up and gearing up to compete and fill the void left behind by the Kapamilya mob. It’s time Filipino artists compete on the international scene rather than compete with an unbeatable monopoly that is kept profitable using dishonest business practices that had long been eradicated from the entertainment industries of the worlds greatest entertainment capitals.
The Philippines’ mass entertainment and broadcast industry is facing the dawn of a new era as the sun sets — no, crashes down — on ABS-CBN. This new era should be embraced and not feared. To fear it only means that ABS-CBN continues to win in the effort tilt the market and ensure itself continued access to the cornered market it grew fat on over the last several decades.",Others

"Land of the Yellowtards, Redtards, Whitetards and Bluetards",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/land-of-the-yellowtards-redtards-whitetards-and-bluetards/,"Welcome to the land of retards on this side of the Pacific, where just about every flavor and color abounds. That marketing tagline “more fun in the Philippines” actually involves the sheer delight of surviving and navigating the jungle of various forms of “schewfidity” that have infected mass groups of gullible people like a pandemic-causing virus.
You may have noticed those are the colors of the Philippine flag up there in the title, and it’s not just coincidental that each color represents a form of Tardism that has uniquely blossomed in the country; it was probably some self-fulfilling destiny that got the national colors to match the current demography of major misguided groups (composed of activists, thought leaders, influencers, followers, and apologists) that make up the Philippines.
In this article, we will not be covering the Greentards (those overly occupied with calculating Carbon footprints and defending whale rights) or what the anti-government camp calls the “Dutertards” (a.k.a. DDS) who need no introduction these days. Instead we will feature four mainstream groups that are fixated on their own little fairy land fantasies and illusions of grandeur.
Yellowtards – Those who got duped by the farce yellow EDSA revolution of Cory (who may have even given the go signal for her own husband’s assassination), which only led the nation into the dismal 3-decade descent into a cultural abyss of anti-intellectualism, malfunctional chaos and freedom for freedom’s sake (never mind the “run like hell” wish by MLQ). To be worshiped as heroes while protecting The Hacienda was the end goal, which now haunts the Filipino whenever they use their P500 bills or pass through the main international gateway (NAIA) – as a quick subliminal reminder to Never Forget to vote for an Aquino in the next elections.
Redtards – Those who are behind the Philippines being host to Asia’s longest running communist insurgency – thanks to ka Joma Sison who enjoys the luxury of first-world amenities in the Netherlands while his band of fanatical terrorists (the “nothing new” NPA) and obsolete-minded democratic-kuno activist fronts wreak havoc across the land for just about any word that contains “FREE” or “RIGHTS”. They are addicted to revolution, and only really find meaning for existence if an authoritarian figure exists. Painting the government (regardless of who becomes President) as “capitalista, tuta ng America, diktatura”, these are people who after being generously granted free education will use what was invested on them to bring about the downfall of their benevolent motherland.
Whitetards – These are hypocritical religious leaders of the Padre Damaso type. Best represented today by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, these are men who dress themselves white (like a band of Klu Klux Klan supremacists atop their high horses) to sanctimoniously portray their holiness/righteousness externally while they amass wealth (tax free) and use their influence on sheeple to advance the agendas of corporations and political entities they lie in bed with. Vowing celibacy for life, they turn their base human urges toward young lads and romance-deprived nuns and hardly say anything against the abnormally disgusting act of man-to-man copulation clearly condemned in their sacred writings. The hypocrisy is especially glaring when they love to be called “Father” despite their holy scripture’s clear command not to seek titles and honorifics:
“They love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues. they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.” -Matt.23
Finally the Tardism matrix is not complete without this final group:
Bluetards – Never heard? Let’s start with the online-available definition, by Urban dictionary:
A person who is constantly wearing a bluetooth headset in an effort to appear important regardless of setting and or social standing. This person is also oblivious to the fact that they look like a complete douche.
Note: Bluetooth is a technology meant to replace cables of arms-length distance; in contrast with RFID (for eliminating plugging / electrical contact for identification) and Wifi (for eliminating LAN cables for inter-device communication in an office/room).
But a broader way to define bluetards would be through “blue blood” – in reference to aristocrats, and privileged, noble families that are wealthy and powerful, based on the medieval European concept that those of royalty and nobility had blue blood running through their veins.
Bluetards are mainly the elite, powerful, and super rich. They also include the nouveau rich/famous and self-made multi-millionaires of this generation. Then last and least – they include elitist wannabes, humming the tune of “I did my best, but I guess my best wasn’t good enough” while covering up the reality of their pitiful bank accounts with a Louis Vuitton or Prada bag over one’s shoulder. They come in the form of politicians, actors/actresses, athletes, and businessmen who think they are above the rest and assume the rules don’t apply to them because they have a convoy with sirens.
When asked to fall in line like everyone else, they bite back with “Alam mo ba kung sino ako?” or “Hoy, Tatay ko ko kaya si …” Recall Elvis Presley’s hit song “Blue suede shoes”? Don’t you ever step on a bluetard’s ego or cross his path unless you’re willing to be blown off to kingdom come.
The bluetards enjoy living in the Philippines (rather than migrating abroad) because the environment is conducive for fanning one’s ego and being worshiped by fans and followers. They can insulate themselves from the suffering that happens all around them by living in their own exclusive world, the way business or first class on a flight is availed by those who can afford it. Bluetards like making a scene so they can be on front page or prime-time evening news. They take pride in arriving with style on a big black imported SUV when they don’t even have the home-grown tech to make even basic bolts and nuts used to build them.
Should the Philippines have a Royal Family?
This question is being dished out as a thought experiment for the general public to ponder on. Will it only feed the pride and aristocratic mindset of the elite as well as the prevalence of the starstruck ignoramus syndrome? Or will a royal family like those in England and Imperial Japan serve to unite a fragmented nation? Should the royal family be elected every several years like typical politicians? If so, should they be chosen from among the current reigning rich and beautiful celebrities?
The bluetards have been around for so long, we just haven’t called them out as they grew rich and richer because we were too focused on the other tards. If they want so much attention and importance ascribed to them, then here’s the introductory article that officially grants them a place in the crowded Tard landscape of the Philippines.
The Parable of the Ipis Colony and the Pepsi Bottle
An empty Pepsi bottle stood beside a dirt road in an African wildlife preserve, which had residue saliva still sticking on the bottle’s mouth. A nearby Ipis colony easily discovered it and like a bunch of fanatical die-hard egomaniacs all tried to scramble up to the top to win the prize – the glory and honor of getting to lick up those lusciously sweet saliva molecules. As soon as one Ipis got there, another Ipis would knock it off. A few in the struggle fell into the bottle and died. It was chaos like crazy to win the golden opportunity to stand on the pedestal. It meant all the world to these individual Ipis to be on “top of the world”, to the envy of everyone else in the colony.
Meanwhile enormous beasts – elephants, rhinos, and buffalos, just passed by hardly noticing all the action taking place on that abandoned Pepsi bottle. One young elephant asked its gigantic Mama what that bottle covered with Ipis was all about. The Mama admonished the inquisitive calf, “The Ipis think small and believe they are achieving something of great importance the entire world will look up to and applaud, when in fact nobody in the real world really cares. One of these days, someone in the herd will accidentally step on those pathetic creatures and nobody will even shed a tear. Let them mind their own business.”
And the Ipis Colony went about their mysterious insignificant business oblivious of the fact there was a much bigger world out there, up until the inevitable event happened – Squish!",Others
#ABSCBN products are mental health HAZARDS designed to elicit Filipinos’ TINGALA Reflex,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abscbn-products-are-mental-health-hazards-designed-to-elicit-filipinos-tingala-reflex/,"It took many years for Big Tobacco to be called out as an immoral industry — one that for years legally sold addictive poison to consumers who did not know better. In that context, perhaps this the time to really examine what media conglomerate ABS-CBN are really doing to Philippine society.
ABS-CBN products are, at best, like cigarettes and, at worst, as lethal as illegal drugs. Their products give a temporary addictive high to people who consume them, contribute nothing to mental well-being, and, instead, leave a permanent sense of crushing personal inadequacy in the average Filipino. The role models ABS-CBN “entertainment” put up are far beyond the reach of ordinary Filipinos. They are tall, fair-skinned, and exploit that debilitating social cancer that is Filipinos’ persistent colonial mentality.
ABS-CBN artistas are engineered to project a commanding presence that elicit Filipinos’ ingrained tingala reflex while, at the same time, disarming them with their pedestrian palengke-speak. They are products of marketing genius that reach out from our devices with those twin emotional hooks. The very nature of ABS-CBN’s business model — one that extracts most of its revenue from advertising — assures one that its products , at their core, aim to induce irrational consumerism.
ABS-CBN is, of course, a player in the free market. The cornerstone of this free market is the assumption that consumers are free to make “rational” purchasing decisions. In a way, its character and that of its products mirror the character of the market within which it plays. In reality this market is nothing like the “rational” one that “economists” lead us to believe is in place. The market — specially the Filipino market — is really an emotionally-driven one and ABS-CBN is a razor-sharp knife that easily cuts through meat fattened and made tender by the emotionalism it so expertly serves.
Like users of social media, ABS-CBN’s audience are not their customers and, more important to note, they are not the people they claim to be “in the service of”. Rather ABS-CBN’s audience are the meat product (fattened by OFW remittances and hooked in by their artistas) that they serve to their sponsors and advertisers on a buffet table to be feasted upon. Just business. Nothing personal. The point here is that the Opposition narrative that portrays ABS-CBN and its artistas as “victims” in this circus is a flat out lie.
The truth is, there are lots of people, businesses, and communities out there that could quickly fill the void that ABS-CBN would leave if it were to vanish off the face of the Earth tomorrow. If ABS-CBN were to disappear as such, the Philippines’ arts scene would be vastly invigorated. Gone will be the Goliath in the industry that crushes all the little Davids that dare go up against it with their independent productions and imagination-rich original ideas. Indeed, it is interesting to observe that the biggest defenders and apologists of ABS-CBN are the very people who lament the artistic bankruptcy of Philippine mass media. Then again that’s no surprise given the track record of today’s Opposition — specifically partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan — in being selective in their chosen advocacies on the basis of whether or not these fit their preferred political narrative.
The time is ripe for ABS-CBN to be called out for what it really is — a big bad corporation that profits massively off the ignorance of the Filipino masses. It’s high time something is done about it. Shutting ABS-CBN down is, in fact, the least of Filipinos’ challenges. The bigger challenge is in undoing the vast and profound cultural damage ABS-CBN has wreaked across Philippine society.",Others
#ABSCBN taught Filipinos all the WRONG values,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/abscbn-taught-filipinos-all-the-wrong-values/,"The way Opposition partisans, specially those among them loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan (a.k.a. the Yellowtards) screech about the shutdown of ABS-CBN’s radio-based broadcasting operations, you’d think an institution essential to Filipino life had met its demise. Much of the brouhaha is centred around the testimonials of ABS-CBN talents themselves such as Pinoy Big Brother alumna Kim Chiu who, in a drama-laced tililing rampage, swore by her employer’s ability to open doors for the Batang Yagits of this world and turn people’s lives around.
Filipinos should stop, step back, and put their thinking caps on to take stock of what is really going on here. The Yellowtards are, once again, weaving the same old perverted narrative around the ABS-CBN circus that they had used for more than thirty years to emotionally blackmail Filipinos into marching en masse in lockstep to their dishonest cause. Indeed, ABS-CBN itself is the weapon of mass stupidification that had long been the jewel in the Yellowtards’ arsenal of mass persuasion.
Think of it for a minute. Under the command of the ABS-CBN-Yellowtard Axis are “artists”  whose very livelihoods involve getting into people’s heads and keeping them hooked. Partisan and “activist” communities are propagating what are essentially emotional appeals with zero underlying intellectual substance using the showbiz star power of ABS-CBN “talent”. This is worse than dishonesty. It is an effort to create a cult following and not the enlightened society that is key to a successful democracy.
So back to the question on whether ABS-CBN live up to their mission statement of being “in the service of the Filipino”. Are they, really? The sorts of irrational emotionalism that the network aided by its supporters aim to create is no different to the mass hysteria that left 88 dead (some reports say 73) in 2006 as fans of the now defunct ABS-CBN product Wowowee stampeded for free tickets and big prizes being dangled before them by the show’s producers.
Despite this tragedy, the star host of the program Willie Revillame evaded accountability and managed to bag for himself a gig with another practically identical show, this time under the TV5 network, dubbed Willing Willie. The show, which premiered in 2010, went on the become embroiled in another controversy, this time for condoning child exploitation where, in one episode, a six-year-old child was encouraged by Revillame to engage in a striptease act. A BBC report following the incident suggested that Philippine entertainment programming could be “abusive” in nature.
Are these programmes helping the poor, as Revillame and his fans maintain, or are they taking advantage of people’s desperation?
Joey Reyes, a film director and critic, said these shows were seen as a panacea for the problems of the poor.
“They exploit the fact that people need a sense of hope,” he says.
Not only that, contestants who recount the saddest personal stories are often the ones to win the most money, with the result that they “almost celebrate poverty”, according to Mr Reyes.
This seems to be the crooked playbook used by ABS-CBN to further its interests, whether these be in its core media business or in the national politics of the Philippines within which it is deeply-invested. But, over the three decades that ABS-CBN have lorded it over the Philippines’ airwaves, a key question persists:
What productive values have they actually imparted on Filipinos?
The venerable Filipino writer Francisco Sionil José in his short note “ABS CBN: A Requiem” posted on Facebook nailed it…
The Filipinos do not really need ABS-CBN. It does not produce goods or food. It has certainly entertained millions but it did not diminish poverty. Again, freedom worked for the rich—but not for the Filipinos.
It is very hard — virtually impossible — to argue against that, simply because it is true. The tragedy here is that ABS-CBN might just succeed in this latest drama production because showbiz thinking almost always trumps all else in the Philippines.",Others
"Staying True to their Calling, Wokes and Yellows Remain Consistent with Their Inconsistencies",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/staying-true-to-their-calling-wokes-and-yellows-remain-consistent-with-their-inconsistencies/,"In engineering, the way to assure that the design or the system works is through consistency. If the desired outcomes are consistently observed, the designer is assured of a peaceful night’s sleep.
At the start of the design process, it is expected that the output will be random and all over the place. That’s normal. Over time however, after a few iterations and calibration, a pattern will emerge. That’s predictability. It is extremely important because it is the only indication that the system or the design is working out fine.
The problem begins when the expected response becomes erratic after calibration. When that happens, it is certain that something is wrong.
The same can be applied to wokes and the Yellowtards. Their consistent inconsistencies that they are exhibiting are indications of hypocrisy, and double/triple even multiple standards.
They specialize in cherry-picking and moulding current issues to fit their narratives while ignoring facts that will tear apart their faulty arguments. You have to admire however, their persistence in making these episodes on social media on a regular basis such that the usual initial reactions of anger and eye-rolls can now be replaced with a grin and/or a chuckle.
One example of their hypocrisies are those who irresponsibly insisted on organizing rallies despite of them being fully aware that rallies are perfect grounds for transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Recently, they joined the popular cry to give the medical frontliners their much needed timeout to recharge.
Risa Hontiveros in a previous interview with Arnold Clavio cried foul over the sexism and “slut-shaming” of her fellow senator Leila Delima during the congress hearings, and yet she wasn’t able to utter anything sensible when asked about her reaction regarding Ronnie Dayan’s legal wife being hurt as the illicit relationship unfolded on national TV.
Defenders of the now defunct ABS-CBN franchise used emotional blackmail against the government particularly the congressmen on the alleged 11,000 workers that will be displaced. And yet these defenders were eerily silent when the network sought every means necessary to delay the just compensation of Weng Hidalgo. Same with the issue of technical personnel who filed labor malpractice against the network and won. Were there any mass gatherings conducted to air their support and to condemn the clear violation of their rights?
Some Catholic priests who allowed themselves to be prostituted by politics even wished for the president to get sick (and only God knows who else are on their wish list).
Those and a lot more, just to name a few.
The problem with being inconsistent, is that it raises red flags with sensible observers. Instead of making their arguments sound to convince the public, they continued to hurl insults to the majority (an overwhelming majority, based on surveys) by tagging them as “bobo”. And as such, they drove the final nails to their political coffins as the silent majority voted them out in the recent elections.
Disillusionment is but one of the many problems with having multiple moralities instead of calling a spade a spade whether it’s in ones’ favor or not. Another is you need to keep track of how you stand on different issues, which has become a constant stumbling block for Leni Robredo. And she drew a lot of flak already from the very people they desperately needed on their side.
That’s where we need to check our own biases and be consistent to call out what’s wrong even if it means confronting the very people who are on the same page as ours. This is especially true for the opposition and their woke supporters if they want to stay relevant and not be perpetually viewed as clowns and nuisance. Because inconsistency is a stink, an indication that something is rotten from within. And it isn’t something that’s going to help the country nor the Liberal Party’s dream of getting back to power.",Others
Filipino “Menial” Mentality leads to Abuses,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/filipino-menial-abuses-covid-19/,,Others
The Philippines needs a strong police and army more than ever,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/the-philippines-needs-a-strong-police-and-army-more-than-ever/,"Terrorists are getting bolder as it becomes ever more pointedly evident that the Opposition (specifically its leading blocs, the communists and the Yellowtards) regard demonisation of the police and the military as cornerstones of their sick ideologies. Indeed, Filipinos have long suspected strong links between the Yellowtards (the bloc of rabid partisans loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists seeing how, back in the 1980s, the late former President Cory Aquino upon grabbing power made it one of her top priorities to release key communist leaders from prison. Both camps habitually push for extra-constitutional — basically criminal — approaches to changes in leadership as well as paint Filipinos as chronic victims of circumstances that are, in actual fact, of their own making.
This habitual painting of the army and police under a bad light by the current Opposition traces its roots to the “Martial Law” rhetoric that bred an entire generation of Martial Law Crybabies and three decades of the ensuing crybabyism dominating the national political narrative. It did not seem to occur to these partisans that a strong nation that lives by the rule of law is made possible by a strong military and a world-class police force. Now, nobody is saying that the Philippines’ military and police are perfect, but demonising them never was a solution to those gaps. The key lay in recommending solutions and charting a pathway forward to achieving a desired outcome. Sadly the Yellowtards chose a destructive approach instead, anchoring their thinking on the past and launching their demonisation campaign. Both this fixation on the past and this repeated slander of the police and military have since become their trademark position. The only real beneficiaries of such a shortsighted campaign were the communists and other organisations that rely on terrorism as a pillar of their strategic agendas.
We now see the results of decades of withering assault on the country’s state forces mounted by the Yellowtards and communists. The Philippines’ military and police forces are weak and underdeveloped, routinely disrespected, and woefully underfunded. The fact that the country’s elite cocoon themselves within fortified gated communities and that private security is a billion-peso industry in the Philippines are testaments to the flaccid state of the country’s police and armed forces. The Yellowtards together with the communists in cahoots with the Philippines’ mass media industry (including virtually all of university campus “journalism”) have effectively created an environment that not only breeds but coddles terrorists. It has also created a sissy culture where victimisation is a key criterion to being regarded as a “hero”, where dead relatives are made platforms upon which dishonest political careers are launched, and where being a sissy is regarded as a “woke” virtue.
Filipinos need to put an end to the sissy culture being propagated by the Yellowtards and the communists. Look at all the world’s greatest nations. They are nations built by the sword and have blood-soaked histories of conquest and warfare. That the Philippines has no history of ever having won a war and, for that matter, altogether lacks any semblance of a martial tradition says a lot about its national character. Clearly, the Yellowtards and the communists are roadblocks to greatness. It’s time the Filipinos take decisive action against these cultural and political cancers that seek to embed defeatist mindsets and breed sheep-like people.",Others
On lone dependence on memes as protest tools,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/on-lone-dependence-on-memes-as-protest-tools/,"There was a time when protests were done knowing well enough that such actions could cost your life or a stint in prison. Whether it was on the streets, or publishing or airing subversive materials, people were prepared for any possibility of harm that may come their way for pushing whatever vision or reforms they advocated.
They also wrote and articulated their visions for society. Lengthy treatises, essays, and journals presented a precise picture of what these people wanted to accomplish and most, if not all of the time, pushed for inclusiveness and the deliberate stance of convincing people to join their cause and subsequently increase their numbers and influence.
In 2020, there’s a pronounced difference in the way clashing ideas are presented to the world. Thanks in no small part to the democratization of access to information and technology. Suddenly the tools available to only a small fraction of people before—a platform with an audience, publishing capability, video production—are now in the hands of the average person. And this presented a tricky scenario as far as exchanges of ideas between opposing camps are concerned.
These days, anyone with a mobile device and access to an internet connection can contribute to discussions about everything. Of course, as far as discussions go, politics and social issues are perpetually on top of the preferred topics. And this is the digital era where information is presented in a myriad of different platforms, and near-infinite sources of said messages.
While the advent of social media was hailed as a great equalizer in terms of wresting the controls from the kind of narrative traditional media wanted to impose, its downside was in sifting through tons of noise, shady, and downright malicious and false information. With the latter being exploited to the hilt by traditional media as sources of “fake news”.
And since digital content is so easy to generate and share across numerous avenues, people became lazy in producing original materials and have been dependent on just sharing other people’s outputs and ideas to express themselves. Aside from opinion pieces and blogs/vlogs—still the best methods in articulating one’s thoughts—the most popular mode of expression these days are through memes. The latest incarnation of protest through humor against a perceived enemy. Simple, straightforward, and easily recognizable.
Nothing wrong with sharing memes, because they serve a function as outlets to humor and witty discussions. But solely depending on these things as the only ways to present your stand on any divisive issue is, while valid, ultimately counterproductive and a dead-end when it comes to your desired outcome.
Like effigies and parodies, memes are direct and uncompromising in their attack. And like the other tools that preceded it, should be treated as a supplementary aid rather than a primary mode of expression. The total dependence to it presents a one dimensional portrait of the sharer, which is simply opposing for opposing’s sake, or the opposite. No other insight or rational explanation behind it, just a constant attack. No answer as to why the person thinks that way about something . And there’s no chance (no matter how small) to entice someone with an opposing view to take a step back and ponder on the valid points of the opposite spectrum. As mentioned before, it’s a dead end.
Well and good if your only goal is to irritate and provoke your Facebook and Twitter contacts on the opposite side of the fence until you get muted or blocked. Mission accomplished in that aspect. But as far as opening a discussion to present a stand in a sober and coherent light, it leaves a lot to be desired. Which is a pity, because people tend to learn more on ideas in direct opposition to theirs than from someone with the same opinion.

Ayuda is not An Entitlement and cannot be permanent,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/05/social-amelioration-never-be-normal/,"In this time of Covid-19, aside from the poor, even middle class and rich people asked for relief goods. That was funny. While it may be necessary for a time, some will want it indefinitely. This is abuse. So the thrust after the lifting of quarantine should be getting back to work, which should be the real normal.
Sure, there are people worth helping, but there are people worth snubbing. Some people will call it cruel, saying, why snub them, have you no empathy? Wait, what is empathy? Understanding how people feel. But empathy does not always mean agreement. It means you will also understand what people need, not what they want. Emotional commiseration is not enough. You should hold people to their responsibilities.
Part of that is self-responsibility. That it’s a harder world after Covid is a poor excuse. In a harder world, you have to work accordingly.
I’m pretty sure the woke “advocates” will rise to the occasion again. One of the worst things they could do is go around and see if someone is supporting themselves and not anybody else, and then try to force that person to provide for others. Even if you force someone to do good, it is not necessarily good. It is force – you disregard an individual’s right to self-determine.
The wokes assume supporting forced redistribution is a way to save the world. But it isn’t. They assume if they force redistribution from the rich to poor, it will work and the work will thank them for it. That’s a delusion of grandeur.
The fact is, people are limited, and any form of help has a limit.
I don’t mind though if people do their own efforts to distribute goods and efforts. Even Ligo Sardine’s effort to provide goods is OK (taking a snipe at the government was perhaps needless). If it’s a voluntary effort, it’s all good. If charity is made compulsary, it no longer becomes charity. You need that voluntary element to make charity real and sincere.
People complain about tyranny and human rights because of Duterte, Marcos, inept barangay people beating up quarantine violators, and other criminal things happening around us.
But forced redistribution is also tyranny.
In a post-covid world, individual responsibility can’t be more emphasized. We need to build the world again after a disaster lays waste to it. And permanent ayuda-seekers won’t contribute to building. They’ll increase the waste.
All these moral police wannabees who support permanent ayuda better wise up. They’re only in it for the glory, and probably wouldn’t care if others they claimed to help didn’t receive it. They either put their money where their mouth is or lock themselves in their bedrooms and cry a river because they didn’t receive ayuda. Perhaps the latter is more well-deserved.
ABS-CBN and the Ayuda attitude
And since ABS-CBN is the hot copy of the moment, let’s look at the flaccid emotional appeals by their actors. Kim Chiu especially is in the hot seat, and her argument is that ABS-CBN is a hope of poor people to escape poverty. But as Benign0 said in his article about the issue, that’s a huge exaggeration of what really happens. Only a select, really minute few make it to Kim’s level right now, while everyone else’s dreams get smashed when rejected at the auditions – so how could that make the station a hope for people in poverty?
Let’s look at it then from her case. She became famous because of Pinoy Big Brother – that voyeuristic program that originated from the Netherlands where people show their crass behavior for the entertainment of the world. In the foreign Big Brother, the participants were poked fun at. That was their purpose. And they became infamous, rather than famous, for it. PBB tried to sanitize this, but the basic premise remains the same.
Viewers watch bad examples, then they assume, hey, it’s easy to become famous. So they attempt to just become famous by showing assholeness, or doing anything nonsensical for stupid pride’s sake. One example: the Pabebe girls (where are they now?). Another, that teen in a viral video who went into a 7-11 store and bit hotdogs, then put them back. I bet if ABS-CBN hosted a hot coil challenge, people will bite (and burn themselves).
I agree employees of ABS-CBN have it hard, since I know at least one former colleague from RPN-9 who is an employee there. Ayuda for them for a while would be OK. But in the first place, they are suffering because of the greed of their employers. One of my relatives had been an employee of ABS-CBN Digital, and he left because he couldn’t bear with the assholes he had to work with. By now those assholes are probably among those screaming for ayuda after their Starbucks allowances went kaput.
National artist F. Sionil Jose accused ABS-CBN of being a promoter of communist ideals. Also, some may recall the “conspiracy theory” that the network’s content encourages people to stay poor so they could be voter fodder for politicians. For me, the network executives just want to see the ratings go up and don’t care whether the audience is poor or not.
Some wokes (Rigoberto Tiglao said many former NPAs found work in media) in the company insert their moral policing into their work, and encourage people to seek permanent ayuda. Put that together with shows that encourage revenge and going around the law, as well as the “wanting to be famous through crassness” attitude above, it points to ABS-CBN (and other companies, even in other countries) spreading a false sense of hope. The company is profiting on false values, and it is should raise the ire of people who value public morals.
The rich of our mass media may support forced redistribution, but will not include their own wealth in it. They don’t put their money where their mouth is. Hypocrisy is the name for it. But I do hope this fracas on ABS-CBN will lead to a wider discussion of those issues and perhaps lead to changes in local media that will correct these false values.
But yeah, who am I kidding?",Others
ABS-CBN was a failed experiment in trusting the private sector to shape national culture,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/abs-cbn-was-a-failed-experiment-in-trusting-the-private-sector-to-shape-national-culture/,"Looking back at how ABS-CBN had influenced Philippine society, one can argue that the whole franchise was a failure. Supporters of the failed network hinge the whole rationale of its existence on “media freedom”. But, while there is clear merit in media freedom, this freedom does not seem to have been applied wisely in the Philippines. While that freedom, in principle, will have ideally encouraged diversity in culture, thinking, and production, media production in the Philippines has, instead, gravitated into today’s dominant monoculture of shallow cinema, trashy television, unoriginal music, and offensive Web content. Suffice to say, unleashing “media freedom” in the Philippines was the equivalent of granting a seven-year-old child unlimited access to the Internet.
Indeed, the entire business model of ABS-CBN can be said to have exploited Filipinos’ freedom to be stupid. The logic of ABS-CBN shareholders, its executive management team, and its fandom-turned-“activists” is almost criminal. If Filipinos are willing to pay good money for crap, that’s just the free market in all its wondrous wisdom at work, is the thinking they apply to running their business. ABS-CBN get their million-peso blockbuster hit and Filipinos get their Pinoy Big Brother fix. Everybody’s happy. The results can be seen today. Even the arguments that are applied to defend its lost “cause” are stupid.
Think of what it would be like if such as a dishonest business as ABS-CBN continue to be allowed to pollute the country’s airwaves and cinemas. Filipinos will keep forking out hard-earned cash to see increasingly mediocre products which big media conglomerates will happily churn out in mind-numbingly vast quantities at enormous profit. Bad content, sustaining bad taste which, in turn fuels more demand for bad content. It would be a doomed society.
Now that ABS-CBN is toast, the opportunities to fill the void it leaves are endless. This is a chance to start from scratch and build a media company that truly serves the Filipino people. For that, we can turn to the experience of the United Kingdom for some inspiration.
Consider the original public service charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The BBC was created by Royal Charter as the state broadcasting monopoly in 1927 under the direction of the 12 members of the BBC Trust. These members are each appointed by the British monarch and while they enjoy complete independence in the running of the BBC, its primary purpose, summarised by John Reith, its first Managing Director, is to “educate, inform, entertain”, a key part of its mission statement to this day.
The BBC remained a television broadcasting monopoly in the United Kingdom from 1927 to 1954 and its monopoly on radio was broken up only as recently as 1972. But even after broadcasting in the UK was opened to competition, the BBC remains the dominant media organisation there and its values have remained largely consistent to its original charter. Public service remains its primary function and today is governed along the lines of the following set of principles:
– Sustaining citizenship and civil society;
– Promoting education and learning;
– Stimulating creativity and cultural excellence;
– Representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities; and,
– Bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK.
Furthermore, its current version of the charter demands that the BBC “must display at least one of the following characteristics in all content: high quality, originality, innovation, to be challenging and to be engaging” and that it must “demonstrate that it provides public value in all of its major activities.”
In considering the BBC experience, perhaps there is value in reconsidering the approach to mass communication in the Philippines given the clearly evident immaturity of its society and the formidable challenges the country faces in uplifiting the intellectual faculties of its people.
Broadcast media and cinema continue to be key channels into the minds of Filipinos and a major shaper of culture. To delegate this entire space to the private sector — particularly big corporations driven primarily by profit and by the dishonest agendas of their top shareholders’ golf buddies and former schoolmates is practically criminal. Now that ABS-CBN’s formidable footprint is out of the picture and the landscape ripe for the farming of more intelligent and original work, the Philippines’ prospects of progressing into a truly modern and smarter society look promising.",Others
The Right Way to “Cancel” Culture… and maybe Disease,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/cancel-culture-and-disease/,,Others
Leaders are overrated; and the myth of one-man rule,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/leaders-are-overrated-henchmen/,"Some people still say the solution to the Philippines’ problems is choosing the right leader. That’s the very mindset that led the country down to the dumps.
The problem is that leaders are treated as a “silver bullet” or quick do-it-all solution. Filipinos believe that the leader will do everything for them, including clearing the nation of corruption. This is their Juan Tamad nature at work.
People who insist on choosing the right leader are often either the promoters of propaganda and long-time fallacies that have been used throughout history to dupe people, or are themselves duped.
The shills will often promote their own leader as the right leader for all. They will warn you against “bad leaders,” insisting that these are the cause of society’s downfall. They will also attack these supposed “bad leaders” (who are actually just their competition), even if these are actually more qualified or are doing something right. Some even name business leaders as proof that there is such a thing as a right leader, such as Jack Welch or Steve Jobs. I will however puncture that balloon later.
One source of the problem, as I attacked in an earlier article, is the idea that are “born” leaders. All they need is figure out who the born leader is, then support them and all will be well. If they found they got the wrong leader, just oust and oust until they get the “right” or “born” leader.
As reality has demonstrated, that’s not how it works. Leadership and character are not inborn traits; they are learned.
Let me recall another point in another earlier article: Leaders never do it alone. There are always the henchmen. That’s why I believe the idea of “one-man rule” is ridiculous and never was true. It is doubtful Ferdinand Marcos went out and killed people himself. He gave orders and the other people did it. It’s funny how many people keep on screaming against Marcos and say little to nothing against the people, who were formerly under Marcos’ command, who actually killed others (and who were also retained!).
In fact, it has been suggested that henchmen are the actual ones in control of the country. If corruption is to be eliminated from the country, there are a lot to take out, not just the Marcoses.
So successful leaders aren’t the only source of success in companies; “henchmen” are also a part of it. Jack Welch could not have made his plans for General Electric successful without willing “henchmen” in the company. Steve Jobs could not have made Apple successful without Steve Wozniak and other people, including investors. Saying leaders are single-handedly responsible for success is a huge exaggeration.
This talk about leaders is relevant for the recent martial law anniversary. The wokes (including the opposition) who scream “never forget martial law” and similar that were probably the types who’d thought, we got the wrong leader, so oust him and we’ll get a new one. The problem is, the new one did the same thing (Mendiola massacre). Regime change didn’t – and really doesn’t – bring any change to society at all.
That also should have broken the harebrained impression that Marcos is the source of all things evil and getting rid of it will make the country all good. Today, Marcos is long gone, but murders, disappearances and all manner of heinous crimes still happen. The Marcos family having some power right now doesn’t count. Other people do evil acts by themselves without their influence.
The wokes also scream Marcos this, Marcos that. In a way, it is an admission of defeat because they show by screaming at a dead body that they are unable to take down the corrupt who are still living. I also wonder if they’ve screamed at the commies who also murder a lot of people and take “revolutionary taxes” from people and businesses in the country.
If the behavior of even “little leaders” in barangays (like the enforcers who beat up a vendor in Manila), local governments and even private sector situations including hobby groups shows, the problem is not leaders, but culture. The corrupt behavior that Filipinos manifest whether as leaders or constituents is a product of culture.
Filipinos often like to suck up to “leaders” because they are expecting dole-outs. Filipinos in positions often like to steal from the resources entrusted to them. Filipinos want impunity from the consequences of their actions because they are “kawawa” or pitiful. Filipinos when presented with a chance to exploit someone helpless, like a little kid, a lonely lady or a frail old person, will go in for the kill. All of this is part of our country’s culture, as in the actual practice of people.
This is why, aside from my point that the country will not benefit from the “right” leaders, the country was not brought down by bad leaders. It was brought down by bad culture.
If we want to get rid of corruption – as well as choices of bad leaders – change in the culture, right down to the grassroots, needs to be done.
We don’t need the “right” leaders or any other such bozos. People just need to shape their own lives up. They should be responsible for themselves and not dump responsibility on their “leader.” Filipinos need to accept that “ayuda” or dole-outs is not an entitlement or right. These are important parts of culture change.
The goal is to make leaders irrelevant. If people are responsible for themselves, they don’t need leaders. In fact, one of the best things a true leader does is to show his people how to continue without him. In other words, a good leader knows how to make himself eventually irrelevant.
Leaders be damned. Some people have lived and some communities have thrived without them. Perhaps we need to reevaluate the value and impact of leaders throughout history, because it occurs to me that these have been grossly overstated.",Others
Ninoy was Dead Wrong: The Filipino is NOT worth dying for,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/ninoy-was-dead-wrong-the-filipino-is-not-worth-dying-for/,"Did the fake hero utter a lie when he said: The Filipino is worth dying for ?
Let’s do a little thought experiment: Recall that Filipina who was on death row abroad…Yes, Mary Jane Veloso, who was arrested and sentenced to death for smuggling heroin into Indonesia. Let’s have a show of hands. Who among you would volunteer to take her place so she could live?
Even giving your left kidney for your neighbor or relative is already something hardly anyone would consider, how much more sacrificing your one and only life for a Filipino stranger? One would not even offer to lose his/her 2 eyes (which one would value at a billion USD a piece) in exchange for the life of any politician (not even for Duterte or Pacquiao).
So really, was Ninoy serious about giving his life up for “the Filipino”? Best bet is… he just wanted to sound patriotic, and with such a quotable quote under his belt, actually earn him a place in the Pinoy hall of heroic fame (should any misfortune happen along the way).
For someone too rabidly infatuated with political power, fame and glory, why would he forfeit his life for fellow Filipinos? For a man willing to kill Filipinos to get to the throne or be so reckless enough to weaponize the communist cause just to wreak havoc, mayhem and destruction on Pres. Marcos’ administration, you will begin to doubt such a noble declaration of self-sacrifice.
This Ninoy guy was too hungry for satisfying political ambition, dying for anyone would be the last thing on his mind.
Before we dig deeper, how do we measure worth? Typically, it’s about output. If you’re a lazy scumbag, people would call you worthless. If one were a creative genius like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, then such a person would be a national treasure. And up to how high a value does it make something or someone worth exchanging your life for?
What is a Filipino’s intrinsic worth?
So yes, that famous line by Ninoy was likely all just for show, or the guy was just outright lying through his teeth. If he knew for sure a bullet was coming for him at the tarmac that day he never would have taken that flight back to the Philippines.
The fact is: Filipinos are NOT worth dying for. (Well maybe for resource-rich Philippines – yes; but for the residents?) Are we such special and rare specimens of the human race to be worth preserving? Ask Donald Trump of Jack Ma if they would die for a Filipino. Who in the world esteems Filipinos that highly to actually die for them? With his categorical denials, not even our national hero Jose Rizal was actually willing to face the firing squad for the revolution he unintentionally ignited.
Sorry to rain on your parade (esp. for Yellow folks), but all this celebration for a man who was actually a traitor and a terrorist all for the grand delusion of Presidential glory is a complete waste of time and attention.
If you want Filipinos worth dying for, try learning rocket science with ambitions to fly to Mars. Probably by then, people will scramble to become human shields just to protect such a high-value asset. And finally, while you process this article (in probably denial stage), here’s the breaking news of the week…

Manifesto of the Yellowtard Wet Dream,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/manifesto-of-the-yellowtard-wet-dream/,"It’s a bit sad to see Philippine Opposition “activists” and partisans looking longingly overseas as their counterparts in other countries mount impressive mass protests on their city streets. You could almost imagine Filipino “activists” wailing about how they “invented” street “revolutions” back in the 1980s and now have to suffer the indignity of being reduced to a mere bleachers crowd.
There’s something to be said about how the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) all but squandered the abundant political capital they once enjoyed. Over a period stretching from 1983 when former Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr was assassinated and crowned political saint through to the early- to mid-2000s, yellowtardism and its mob of “street parliamentarians” lorded over Philipine politics. Those heady days must have created the false sense of a bottomless well of silver or, shall we say, yellow bullets to “vanquish” any leader arbitrarilty slapped with the label “tyrant” or “fascist” by the one “thought leader” or another.
Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, this well of political capital ran dry long before they even realised it. It is no different to how the Philippines’ lush forests were denuded by the shortsightedness of a people who built an entire strategy on spending principal instead of living off interest. No different too to the baffling way Filipinos woke up one day surprised by a population that had suddenly ballooned to more than a hundred million. They just did not feel the rug being slowly pulled out from under their feet until it was too late.
Most astounding of all, the Yellowtards and their communist comrades still don’t get it. Inciting the same old “people power” circuses continues to be a cornerstone of their political strategy. So addicted are they to this dishonest approach that they now even use a dead baby — Baby River — as the main protagonist of their latest Victim Porn production. How low can they get? Evidently this is the lowest so far having tried a dead former senator, his dead wife, and a dead Interior Secretary to prop up one quaint “movement” after another or one two-bit politician or the other.
Small wonder that this motley group of commies, wokes, and prayerful “liberals” now forlornly look beyond Philippine borders with envy as protestors fill the streets from Bangkok to Hong Kong and from Seoul to the other side of the planet in Philly among other places. “Sana all”, they lament in their cultivated private Catholic school accents in between booger-crystallising sighs.",Others
Filipino-American nutjobs cry bloody “cultural appropriation” over Barkada wine bar,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/filipino-american-nutjobs-cry-bloody-cultural-appropriation-over-barkada-wine-bar/,"A Washington DC wine bar originally christened Barkada was forced to change its name following a “social media backlash” from a small group of nutjobs from the Filipino-American community. The National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA), which claims to “[represent] many Filipino organizations, Filipino business owners and workers, and concerned Filipino community members within and beyond the DC Metropolitan Area” issued a statement on its Facebook page demanding that the owners of said wine bar “[issue] an apology that reflects an understanding of white privilege and cultural appropriation.”
A certain Jessica Millete, presumably some sort of Filipino community leader in the DC area chimed in, screeching on Facebook…
This is problematic on so many levels. Completely ignorant and of course, a PRIVILEGED thought-process. What makes you think it’s okay to take a word from another culture when you pay no respect or homage to the culture itself? No Filipino items on your menu, no Filipino flavors incorporated, no Filipino winemakers included, not even in your decor? No support going towards a non-profit benefiting Filipino Americans or back in Philippines?
It’s apparent you didn’t do any kind of research. Barkada is a very casual word. Why are you applying it to your FANCY AESTHETIC OF A RESTAURANT? Filipinos drink BEER + LIQUOR AND EAT PULUTAN; not wine + cheese.
Not to mention, the Philippines was colonized by SPAIN and SO much of your wine menu is from there!
Absolutely WILD that in our current social climate, you still think this is okay. Just because you think the Asian stereotype is that we stay silent and go along our way, doesn’t mean that’s the case now.
CHANGE YOUR NAME, Barkada Wine Bar, the absolute CAUCASITY.
Quite remarkable the thinking going on here where a community demands that a society that hosts them “pay homage” to their cultural identity and goes on to slam them for their “caucasity”; seemingly suggesting that being of caucasian ethnicity is a bad thing in and of itself. Note too how in her Facebook rampage Millete includes a photo of the establishment owners as if to invite her community to demonise them.
It is beginning to seem like these Fil-Am community “leaders” had been a bit too presumptuous in their fancying themselves as community “thought leaders” seeing the counter-backlash they are now copping as can be seen in this sampling of comments on the NaFFAA Facebook page…
The Filipino-American community are a largely invisible demographic and have failed to make a cultural mark in American society proportionate to their population and the unique historical place their country of origin — a former colony of the United States — enjoys (or suffers) in the world’s history books. It is evident that community “leaders” like Millete and the NaFFAA mount “heroic” efforts to scrounge for relevance in that regard. Unfortunately for them, their approach can’t really fly in a society where achievement is currency. Indeed, America was founded on the premise that entitlement is not a pathway to power — a national character made out by the Founding Fathers to be anathema to the Old World monarchies and aristocracy of the time.
That said, America had progressively devolved into one where entitlement has become fashionable seeing now how mere feelings of offense have become a source of power for an entire generation of snowflakes. A report published on Washington City Paper features a sad apology issued by the owners of Barkada who have agreed to comply…
We apologize to all we offended, and to our community we hope to serve. It was never our intention to appropriate or capitalize on the Filipino culture and we recognize we fell short in engaging more of the Filipino community. Our goal is to be a gathering place for friends in the neighborhood, and to become friends with those neighbors.
Millete and the NaFFAA will likely still feel “offended” by this apology seeing that it did not address the “white privilege” angle in their demands for “homage” to be exacted for their sacrilegious “caucasity”.
As always, when it comes to such snowflakery there is cause for pause harking to these immortal words attributable to the fallen channel for such…

All bark and no bite: Will Leni Robredo REALLY stand up to Duterte as his EQUAL?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/all-bark-and-no-bite-will-leni-robredo-really-stand-up-against-duterte-as-his-equal/,"That remains to be seen. Then again, on second thought, hasn’t Leni Robredo always been on a campaign against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte?
From Day One, “vice president” Leni Robredo remained on campaign mode against her own government long after the elections had been concluded and well into her (disputed) term as VP. She was supposedly elected to be vice president to Duterte. Instead, she continues to feed off an umbilical cord into which the Yellowtards (the bloc within the the Opposition rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) continue to pump a cocktail of destructive and often seditious messaging into her pointed head.
One wonders then where Robredo finds the gall to claim she is being dishonoured by the president and then claim that she now finds the resolve to “fight back”…
“Kapag binastos ako, lalaban ako. Kapag binastos mo ako lalaban ako kasi kailangan kong maging halimbawa, eh. Kailangan ko maging halimbawa sa ibang mga kababaihan na nababastos din,” Robredo said.
(Translated to proper English: “When I am treated rudely, I will fight back. When you are rude to me, I will fight because I need to be an example. I need to be an example to women who are also treated rudely.”)
Overlooking the triple-redundancy in her statement above, one could see that Robredo is invoking a familiar tactic to dishonestly elicit a shrill emotional reaction from her fandom: playing the Woman Card.
Why is it suddenly about women? Well, it is because women are habitually regarded as the “victims” in just about any “fight” partisans and “activists” of wokedom get into. Thus it is the easy pathway they habitually take to make a public appeal. Robredo, in doing so, does a disservice to womankind by propagating the notion that they are perenial “victims” in the ironic fights she tries to incite to fuel her dishonest campaign against her own government.
If women truly aspire to hold their own in the jungle that is national politics, they need to demonstrate that they are able to face their adversaries not as women but as true gender-neutral fighters. There are no women or men in politics — only people and parties competing for attention and, ultimately (this being a democracy), the votes needed to acquire political power.
Does Robredo want to be known to be a leader who acquired power because she is a woman? Or does she want to be known as a leader who acquired power because she is categorically better than the competition? Only when Leni Robredo and her clique of titas are able to answer “no” to the earlier and “yes” to the latter, can they claim to fight an honest fight in Philippine democratic politics. Until then, Robredo runs on a Victim Platform — the worst kind and the kind that keeps the Philippines’ political culture backward. This is the last thing Filipinos need. Filipinos need to make a conscious decision to stop being victims and modernise the thinking they apply to their young democracy. The sort of Woman Card the Yellowtards keep playing works against that aspiration. Enough is enough!",Others
Leni Robredo is not good for the intellectual growth of the Filipino people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/11/leni-robredo-is-not-good-for-the-intellectual-growth-of-the-filipino-people/,"It is quite amazing that the Opposition have not realised yet that all “vice president” Leni Robredo offers is the here-and-now and nothing much beyond that. Indeed, at the time of this writing, Robredo is top of mind amongst her fandom having just scored PR points that landed her some media — and social media — mileage owing to her much-photographed “contribution” to the response and relief effort as two major typhoons within weeks of one another ravaged the Philippines.
In propagating the same old traditional messaging that aims more towards self-promotion and less to other more honourable intents, Robredo sustains a sticky habit that keeps the political chatter stuck on personalities rather than on ideas. As can be observed by the outcome of The Leni Robredo Show written and produced by the eminent “thought leaders” of the Yellowtards (the rabid bloc loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan that presumes to “lead” the Opposition) in response to the impact of recent typhoons Rolly and Ulysses, practically the entire conversation revolved around who did what or, worse, who did more than the other. The more important part of the conversation — how much in the overall scheme of things was a achieved — took a back seat to all the pettiness.
Here, the “overall scheme of things” refers to the broader issue of disaster management — Preparation, Response, and Relief. The latter two, Response and Relief, are often the ones that make the news and, woefully, in the wrong way. The recent episodes starring the “vice president” in the title role illustrate this. Response and Relief are often the most “newsworthy” aspects of disaster management because they have a set of characters not present in the Preparation story — victims. When victims are part of the cast of characters, Filipinos’ favourite protagonist in any story — the Hero — majestically swoops in to save not just the day and but, more importantly, media ratings.
While there is a story to be told about Preparation, it is all just too boring for the average attention-deficited televiewer. Tall and dashing fire fighters and the damsels in negligees they carry out of towering infernos are always better at hooking in an audience compared to stories about the geeky fire wardens who walk around the office with clipboards inspecting fire extingquishers and emergency exits. In the case of the dramas spun by PR managers and “news” producers around annual typhoons disasters in the Philippines, the rotten unfairness of it all is the same. When disaster strikes, the “heroes” get disproportionate kudos for the handful of lives saved. But the people who’s job it is to quietly prepare for or, more importantly, prevent disaster routinely go unsung. Yet it is the work of these unsung heroes that save millions of lives. Unfair indeed.
Leni Robredo is one of those dishonest people who habitually steps onto the “hero” pedestal to exploit disaster and claim credit at the expense of the quiet achievers whose collective work prevented loss of or impact to life that could have dwarfed the handful “saved” by such crooked “heroes”.
Rather than regard the bigger system we are called to design to implement truly systemic and sustainable solutions to mitigate routine risks posed to the Philippines by the typhoons that had long been facts of Filipino life, people like Leni Robredo dumb down essential conversations that need to be had. It’s time Filipinos stop putting up with the intellectual bankruptcy that politicians like Robredo foment. It’s time Filipinos embrace real change and reform their dysfunctional political culture.",Others
Trump Presidency According to Charles Dickens,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/trump-presidency-according-to-charles-dickens/,"Charles Dickens wrote: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” Dickens may have very well foretold about what would become of the Trump administration in America when he published his book A Tale of Two Cities some 160 years ago. Donald J. Trump and his presidency certainly took America by storm, raised it to new heights, and left it devastatingly divided. No amount of attempt to suppress free speech in the name of “civility” (whatever that means in the age of the unholy alliance among the political establishment, liberal media and Big Tech) will ever deny the fact that president Trump has been one of the most (if not the most) colorful presidents in US history.
It would be a shame and wrong if Trump’s presidency will only be remembered for what happened at the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Blaming Trump for the siege of the Capitol building perpetrated by some of Trump’s supporters out of some hundred thousand people who attended the Save America rally in DC will simply miss a marvelous opportunity to look at the root cause of the chaos. We cannot expect the embrace of the “Blame Trump narrative” to pacify these people’s anger and frustration to force a way for the nation to unify. These people feel that they have been disenfranchised, marginalized and simply dismissed. Immediately after the November 3rd elections many of these people did not feel good about how the counting took place. Indeed, the last election has perhaps been one of the most controversial elections the country has had and there have been many accounts of electoral fraud, irregularities and anomalies that many of these people wanted to bring out but were simply dismissed, ridiculed and shunned. Many people felt that the elections weren’t on the up and up; I too (being familiar with the elections shenanigans that occur in the Philippines) did not feel right about how the ballots were counted in the contested swing states. But instead of giving their grievances and collected evidence the light of day, these were basically suppressed and discounted by Trump haters to be mere products of “tantrum by losers”.
For a couple of months many of these people have been trying to point out issues in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but Democrats and the media have ignored them and labeled them as conspiracy theorists. These people had, through their lawyers, thousands of affidavits and a few people were also willing to testify about what they have seen as wrong. They merely wanted their day in court. The state of Texas along with 17 other states including Florida, Georgia and Alabama, people from these states wanted to be heard in the Supreme Court as they wanted to point out what were wrong in the results from the states being contested. Instead of being heard and giving these people their day in court, their cases were simply dismissed not for lack of merit but for lack of standing since state courts, not the federal Supreme Court, ought to hear the case. State Democrats, instead of sitting down with these people and trying to convince these people that the elections were conducted and counted fairly through a careful review of the evidence presented as well as a thorough audit of the ballots, these people’s cases were simply disregarded. To merely accept the result of a highly controversial election is a tough pill to swallow for these people given that Democrats spent 3 long years investigating a Russia collusion hoax but now are unwilling to investigate electoral fraud allegations. It would have made a lot of difference and would have pacified a lot of anger and frustration had these people been heard and had the contested ballots been thoroughly and independently audited.
We have to realize that many of Trump’s supporters support him not because he is “The Donald” but because Donald Trump actually fought for many of the things they believed in. Donald Trump gave these people a powerful voice that the prevailing cultural deities in government establishment, media and cyberspace simply could not stand. Donald Trump was not afraid of the Party establishment, the liberal media and Big Tech. Trump personified the fight many of these people wanted to give to the elites but were not able to give. To ignore or simply dismiss Trump’s electoral fight is tantamount to ignoring and dismissing many of his supporters’ sentiments. Outright dismissal of people’s sentiments and cases is what makes people angry and this is not just about the elections but in all other aspects of life and beliefs. Under the prevailing culture dominated by the left, if a person’s beliefs do not conform with the left’s agenda and narrative then this person gets mocked, ruined and cancelled. To disagree in abortion because of one’s belief in the sanctity of life makes one a religious bigot. To believe that it is unfair for biological males to compete in female sports or that biological males should not be allowed to use girls’ bathrooms makes one a homophobe. To insist that immigrants ought to come to America legally and through merit makes one a xenophobe. To prefer to say All Lives Matter instead of Black Lives Matter makes one a racist. Many people are simply fed up about all these and many of these people feel that cheating their hero out of the presidency is equivalent to them being cheated out of having a voice.
To blame Trump and to suppress his (and his followers’) views and grievances will only make things worse. GRP webmaster benign0 put it simply as “..it is likely that blocking Trump would be the equivalent of putting a lid on a cauldron that is boiling over. What is more important to consider is what to do about the fire underneath that cauldron. … Is Trump the fire that brought many Americans to a boiling point today? Or was that fire burning long before Trump even considered the American presidency back in the lead up to the 2016 presidential elections? This is the real question Americans need to answer.” The question is profound, of course. But in addition, how exactly do we put out the fire?
So how do we deal with the fire? Would keeping a lid on the cauldron get rid of the risk of a blowup or should we work on putting out the fire? If it is the latter, how do we do this if we prevent the conditions conducive to contain the fire and being smothered through discussion and understanding to resolve differences? How do we put out the fire if Trump supporters are expected to stay quiet while the other side airbrushes all of the great things Trump has done for the people and for the country? Would denying credit for the Trump administration having achieved the best economy with the lowest unemployment in modern times where Blacks and other minorities being the biggest winners work? Would denying credit for his administration’s deregulation resulting in reduction of costly business red tape restrictions do the job? Would reversing the Trump administration’s business-boosting tax cuts promote unity? No? Then perhaps the reversal of Trump’s energy policies that unleashed industry production that created tens of thousands of jobs and making America independent of foreign oil supplies and pricing controls would! Maybe that will do the trick, right? Still “No”? Then how about stripping Trump of credit on the First Step Act that lessened the over-incarceration of minorities (91% Blacks) resulting in their sentencing reduction and paving the way to the release of thousands of Black prison inmates giving them another chance in life? Should we maintain that Trump is a racist and go back to Biden’s law in 1994 that caused the mass incarceration of Blacks? Maybe switch the credit for good measure? Give Biden credit for the First Step Act and Trump the 1994 Biden Crime Law? If that is not a good idea then maybe we can smother the fire if we agree to reverse Trump’s foreign policies where NATO countries were made to pay their fair share of the cost? How about Trump’s Middle East policies that led to Israel finally having peace accords achieving normalized relations with multiple Arab nations? Should subscribing to Biden’s policy of appeasing Palestine and Iran make everyone agree to unify? Then we go to the handling of the Covid-19 (as Trump likes to say “China Virus”), should we go back to calling him a xenophobe for overruling “experts” to ban travel from China? Should we simply forget that he established a National Coronavirus Task Force, invoked the Defense Production Act to provide all medical equipment needed to respond to the crisis, implemented a massive national testing program, and organized the Operation Warp Speed program that helped produce and distribute effective promising vaccines and therapies in a historically unprecedentedly short time?
I guess what I am trying to say is that: “Would vilifying and canceling Trump (and his supporters) be the key to unify America?”
Of course, it is also correct to say that Trump did have many follies as well and these were primarily rooted on his big ego. Yes, he had a huge ego problem and to a larger extent, Trump really did become his own biggest enemy! His ego largely caused his demise and I am sure this is a cross he will be bearing for the rest of his life as he looks back at his life’s and his presidency’s triumphs and tragedies. It really is sad to see a man who has done so many great things for the country and its people but will be looked at as a man who also contributed to further divide the nation because he couldn’t temper his ego. It seems fitting to think that Charles Dickens may have also aptly captured the tragic end of Trump’s presidency when he wrote:
“Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.”

FREE: the National Word of the Philippines,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/free-the-national-word-of-the-philippines/,"How many words are there in existence?  Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2005) contains more than 476,000 vocabulary entries. And each word opens an entirely new world in itself. Take the word justice for example, which opens up the complex concept of receiving what one deserves. Or look into words like peace, socialism, or even Noynoying. One can write an entire book just expounding one word.
Recall those quaint little slam books our classmates would pass around, asking our favorite sport, song, or slogan? Well as a people, Filipinos do have their own favorites too as a collective. In this article we look into the national word of the Philippines. Arguably the Filipino’s favorite word would be FREE. Just take a look at how highly valued and deeply ingrained this word is in our entire system and culture:
FREEDOM of expression – Filipinos are loud and simply love to talk. The last thing they would want taken from them is the chance to voice their thoughts. Facebook and mass media are national treasures.
FREEDOM of choice – Filipinos value elections (right of suffrage) so badly, as if the entire world revolves around politics.
FREEDOM from poverty – The Filipino dream has always been to escape the clutches of poverty and live a comfortable life.
FREEDOM from oppression – Filipinos detest any form of foreign power that seeks to lord it over them. Yet they welcome the fact Chinese with Filipino passports give them free air-conditioning in huge Malls they love to spend time around in.
FREE education – Commie/leftist state university students (iskolar ng bayan) expect free education yet seek to bring down the government/administration, the very hands that feed them the gift of knowledge/training on a silver platter.
FREE health care – Filipinos destroy their bodies through their diets and vices all they want, and expect the government to take care of medical expenses to fix them up.
FREE lunch – Filipinos invite themselves to parties and occasions just to get a free meal. Yes there is such a thing as a free lunch – just go to the Philippines.
Freedom and Heroes
Heroism is valued so highly in the Philippines, not because of the concept of sacrifice per se. But rather because of someone else having to make a sacrifice so we can get a certain benefit FOR FREE.
This is why we love naming buildings and roads after heroes. We named our premier international gateway after Ninoy thinking he gave us democracy. We name entire provinces and schools after Rizal thinking he willingly gave up his life at Luneta that day to free us from Spanish rule. Actually Rizal did not want armed revolution, and was wrongly accused for it.
Rizal’s Manifesto to Certain Filipinos
The manifesto, which tried to convince Filipinos to end the revolt, had five points. First, he absolved himself by declaring that he was never a part of the revolution; his name was used to attract Filipinos to join the revolution. Second, he was consulted about the planned revolution but he advised the perpetrators to abandon it. Third, he wanted to stop the rebellion by offering his services to the people. Fourth, he condemned the revolution as ridiculous and barbarous. Fifth, uprising was not an option at that time, that reforms should be the authorities’ initiative, not the citizens’. He made it clear that the people’s education is potent in inducing changes in society.
Freedom from LIES
Although freedom is indeed a word that must be placed high up in the list of things we value, it is still a vast word and concept, and many Filipinos miss the point. We should value a type of freedom more than others. The Author of DNA Code/Information (the ultimate Mind identified in abstraphysics) once said “The Truth shall set you free”.
Filipinos should seek freedom from the lies that have pounded their brains for so long. We’ve been lied to and we lie to ourselves so much these lies have become our reality. As Morpheus said in the Matrix, we need to free our minds. Like a child who once was told by a teacher “you will never amount to anything”, Filipinos should seek to break free from the cycle of perpetuating and living out a lie.
One big lie says you need a teacher and must be enrolled in school to learn. The COVID-19 situation just proved these days that students can actually just learn things on their own online: You’ve got Wikipedia, Youtube, and loads of free training, e-books, tutorials. Peter, James and John were just fishermen, and Andres Bonifacio was just a good reader. Yet they rocked their world back then despite the absence of formal training/education.
Another lie we believe in is that we can’t say NO, and that we are bound to keep repeating the same stupid mistake. If you are addicted to smoking or junk food, then there’s that lie that says you just can’t stop. The truth is – you have the freedom to say NO to anything. Nobody not even your own body can force you. It’s the mind that is over and above natural base instincts and desires.
FREEDOM is a big word. As we celebrate Ninoy Aquino Day this month, let us all reflect on this word, and resonate the call to FREE our main international gateway of that politically charged, biased and divisive Yellow label and progress towards the path of national unity.",Others
Wokes’ brand of justice must never be imposed on the world,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/wokes-brand-of-justice/,"A lot of people are up in arms over the pardon of Joseph Scott Pemberton, since they assume he’ll go scot-free back in the U.S. I’m pretty sure he’ll go through a court-martial, despite the claim of his lawyer. Woke protesters had better make sure of this before they make noise.
If they cry, “what about justice,” or “his punishment is not enough,” they’re wasting their time. There are laws and procedures already in place, and their concept of justice is only their construct. They have no right to demand that their concept be followed by others.
Reality doesn’t care about anybody’s concept of justice. It follows its own rules. If you go into the wilderness and die, as Christopher McCandless did, you cannot bring anyone to court over it. It is a self-inflicted death. If someone is released after serving a term for homicide, that’s what the law calls for. I once wondered aloud why we have only 40 years imprisonment for one count of murder instead of life, but that’s the Penal Code. Someone even told me that prisons will be jampacked with life-term prisoners, so the “light” punishment will help decongest prisons. But I digress.
If someone decides to go to the U.S. to kill Pemberton himself, that’s not justice. That’s stupidity.
This is why we have courts and a justice system. When people impose their own justice on others, it can get out of hand. There is a need to inhibit people from carrying out their own concept of justice on others.
This is the problem with both wokes and communists. They assume the “rich” or certain “offensive” people are the cause of poverty and misery in the world, so they try to impose their own brand of justice. This includes shaming, libeling or even killing those they target (y’all are angry about Pemberton killing a transgender, but not about commies killing innocents?). What they want is not justice, but dictatorship. They are the ones who need to receive a dose of justice.
Punishment will never bring back the dead. One may want to punish people who offended them over and over again to try and feel satisfied, but in the end, it may never be enough. Many people have said that even successful revenge will end up feeling hollow and futile.
People with their own brand of justice ought to keep it to themselves. If one takes things into their own hands, they become the dictator. Instead of focusing on revenge, one best focus on working for their own life and happiness. If they want to change anything outside of themselves, they can only affect their own immediate environment and not the world. “Change the world” is also something that needs to be given a rest.",Others
Jeffrey Laude Plus Iron Sulfide Equals,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/jeffrey-laude-plus-iron-sulfide-equals/,"I find it so ironic that in the same week that a gender reveal party in San Benardino California lead to the obliteration of 12,000 acres ( as of Thursday night Philippine time) of Southern California’s forests , a certain other gender reveal “party” almost 6 years ago has caused tempers to flare locally. You can say it was quite a week for things “on fire. ”
Much has been said in GRP     and elsewhere about this. I want to formulate my own viewpoint and tie everything back to pinoy culture . I will do so with an assist from Sir Elton John using quotes from one of his hidden gems Sweet Painted Lady . In case you are wondering what does Elton John know about the subject, please keep in mind the lyrics of most of the Elton John hits were written by Bernie Taupin.
I’m back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We’re all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we’ve learned
If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there’s pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won’t need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright
Joseph Scott Pemberton. was 19 years old during that eventful Oct night in 2014. Were you ever a 19 year old guy? If you are a woman, have you ever seen a group of 19 year old boys together after being in a predominately male environment in the middle of the ocean for over a month? Are you one of these people who have no idea why there are a concentration of brothels in close proximity to a major harbor? JSP was the archetype of a serviceman “hunting honey with money to burn”.
I smell women
Smell ’em in the air
Think I’ll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there
from the musical Les Miserables
So this is nothing new. US military do their own form of conquering foreign lands with dollars as their ammunition. We all know the US gives intel to all their employees visiting foreign lands and I am sure Olangapo is no exception. considering there was a fully operational US Naval base there pre- Cory. For those who have no idea what that area is like I wrote about one of their most famous residents once.
I would have to believe that the Navy/ Army/ Marines in their pre-shore leave briefing would have warned that there were certain locals who are not what they represent themselves to be. Then again my thoughts  wander to Cafe Havana in Greenbelt at night and the duplicity I assume that goes on there when the sun goes down and the tourist clientele are less than sober. Mr. Pemberton I assume had that fire down below  and sometimes that fire gets in the way of certain processes in the cranium.
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it’s always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that’s the name of the game
Other GRP writers before me have suggested that Jeffrey Laude turns into Jennifer Laude at night  not to fight crime but to ask :
” Hey, Mister, have you got a dime/ Mister, do you want to spent some time/ Oh, yeah/ I got what you want, you got what I need/ I’ll be your baby, come and spend it on me”
Donna Summer
We all know that Mr.Laude suffered fatal injuries administered by Pemberton shortly after what I assumed was a reluctant and spontaneous gender reveal party. Pemberton did testify that the surprise motivated him to attack but he did not believe his attack was fatal. There has to be some poetic justice that this is getting published on the 19th anniversary of one of the most significant surprise attacks in history.
Your anagrams are showing, doctor. ‘Louis Friend?’ Iron Sulfide. also known as fool’s gold.
Clarice Starling
Like the aforementioned night spot in Greenbelt, Makati , there are enough examples of local “fool’s gold” who ” talk like a woman but walk like a man”  in Olangapo. One aspect nobody brings up in this case. If you feel foreigners have every right to do what Pemberton wanted to do then is it OK for men like Mr. Laude to take away the opportunity from women that Pemberton had in mind. You know , the kind who would not send him into a homicidal rage? If you feel Pemberton is in the wrong for “searching for that kind of fun” then you automatically condemn Laude for providing that service in the first place.
Let’s leave this morbid subject for a brief moment and imagine yourself in a restaurant and you are starving on a Friday night. You order comes after 45 minutes and its loud and you already had two beers. You can’t wait to bite into your medium rare prime rib and the waiter lifts up the cover of the still sizzling dish and you find yourself staring at a tofu steak. How angry are you? The waiter has little motivation to deceive you. But imagine your mood at the moment of truth.
So, she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There’s a place in the world for a woman like you
In my eight years writing for GRP , one my common themes is that many pinoys ignore their lack of skills and international relevance by stretching the truth or false representation. They mask a lousy record in a FIBA tournament by trumpeting the quote of an ESPN commentator, they overstate certain circumstances in the Paul Walker accident and no other country celebrates one silver Olympic medal in 20 years like we do. Another scam that is so pinoy is the load scam written in jejemon and masquerading as the telecom but originating from a prepaid number. The message claims that you have to send them 300 pesos in load since they mistakenly sent you 300 pesos load and their ailing mother needs 300 pesos. Must be some sickness.
The killing of anybody is ugly but there were all sorts of ugly in this case that lead to the tipping point. The craving for the pansin necessary to close a business transaction in a red light district anywhere in the world is often preceded by all sorts of iron sulfide. “Bola Lang Yan ” was the refrain of my former professor. This is not a hate crime. It seems Mr. Laude willingly stepped into the lion’s cage using iron sulfide in an effort to masquerade as prime rib when in reality he was tofu steak. Even in the Elton John song there was a place in the world for a woman that Pemberton thought he was getting for the money.   Mr.Laude  ain’t no woman but wanted to be perceived as one in the places he was hanging out in dressed the way he was. All that glitters is ( not) gold and you might know the rest of that Led Zeppelin song.",Others

Day Ten, post Ondoy
by benign0, FilipinoVoices.com
7th October 2009
Lately there’s been a lot of backpatting accompanying all the feel-good stories surrounding the heroism and “bayanihan” supposedly exhibited in the aftermath of the destruction wreaked by tropical cyclone Ondoy on Metro Manila. Indeed, there is reason to congratulate ourselves. The motivation to “help out” and “contribute” to the relief effort transcended social class and political affiliation.
Me, being a frustrated student of the emerging science of macro-psychology, thinks that there are some key elements that underpin such an outpouring of “help”.
Guilt trip.
I see it all over Facebook — people grandstanding about what and how they are contributing “selflessly”. Social networking has encroached on what was once the exclusive role of journalists and the media. The Media once held exclusive claim over the role of capturing images and stories of events and their publication. Not any more. People are now able to — and have taken it upon themselves — to capture events (which they themselves play the “hero” in) on film and self-publish these on the Web for their friends and peers to gawk at. Quiet achievement — with recognition as just a bonus — has been superseded by action with instant-recognition as a pre-requisite.
There is something amusing in seeing well-heeled folk packing relief bags in makeshift warehouses and loading them onto trucks (again I thank Facebook for that). Many of these are people who come from households where domestic servants may outnumber their employers almost two-to-one. Wouldn’t it have been more efficient to simply deploy their servants to those centres to do the manual work while they themselves focus their energies (and core skills) on tasks that deliver bigger, more far-reaching, and longer-term bang (such as getting on the phone to chew out the politicians they routinely fund and hobnob with for neglecting public infrastructure for so long)?
Perhaps all that tacky self-promotion enabled by modern technology hides a more ancient underlying psyche — guilt. Just as feast all year fast for one week is the Filipino motto behind the Easter Holidays (“Holy Week” as Filipinos call it), “helping out” when disaster strikes is what absolves the resource-rich of a way of life characterised primarily by NIMBY-ism (“not in my backyard”).
I’ve fasted/self-flagellated this week.
I’ve contributed/done “my part” today.
What’s the difference between the two? Simple answer: Nothing. They are the same. They both relieve personal guilt over an inability to ingrain doing things properly into our routine way of life. And neither addresses the harder question: What happens next?
The “bayanihan” we see today is just a souped-up version of our normal mode of operations.
It’s just a matter of turning the volume up when it’s time to dance.
Both the rescue efforts during and directly after the disaster and the lifeline of relief effort to victims sustained in its aftermath are driven largely by private sector initiative. They in no way represent our taxes at work properly channeled through public facilities and services. Rather, they are products of informal coping mechanisms — the altruism of the resource-rich and what Randy David calls “private solutions to collective problems” — a testament to the continued applicability of the Filipino Trinity that represents what our lot stands for:
Bahala na (come what may): As always, altruism when disaster strikes saves the day as the preferred alternative to the more onerous task of building sustainable ways of living by investing in measures to mitigate disaster. Why invest in progressively and contnuously strengthening the foundations of our standard of living when we can always rely on the resource-rich to help out when times are tough — as that characteristically Filipino way of thinking goes.
Pwede na yan (that’ll do): For now, most of Ondoy‘s flood victims are surviving on a steady supply of relief goods organised by the resource-rich. When the collective guilt has been absolved, the call to return to business-as-usual starts to overshadow the call to temporary duty, and the images of people “helping out” on Facebook become commoditised, what is an unsustainable pipeline of supplies to begin with reduces to a mere trickle. Eventually everyone moves on — the rich withdraw back into their gated communities and the poor move back into the floodplains. Next disaster, plez.
The third component of the Filipino Trinity — impunity — is what set us up for this disaster in the first place. In the short-term, there were no unpleasant consequences associated with dumping garbage and raw sewage into our storm drain systems.
False hope.
Again, the “bayanihan” we imagine to have happened over the last week or two props up our “hope” that Filipinos will be “ok”. Hope in what exactly? Yes, it’s that niggling question again that remains the elephant in the room.
How can there be hope when far bigger tragedies that occurred in the past due also to human neglect remain unaddressed today. What are we doing differently?
If the way our leaders and future leaders have responded to this disaster can be considered to be good indicators of what happens next, there is little reason to be hopeful.
Indeed, one would expect that our future leaders would have already anticipated much of the key challenges that grip our society even before they had joined the race to begin with.
That’s just a bit too much to ask of Filipino politicians, I suppose; because rather than step up to the grade befitting true leaders, they choose to merely reflect the society they aspire to lead.",Others
No bastard ever won a war by dying for her country,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/no-bastard-ever-won-a-war-by-dying-for-her-country/,"The New People’s Army (NPA) “warrior” Jevilyn Cullamat is now dead. Her grieving mother, Bayan Muna Representative Eufemia Cullamat, described her as a “martyr” too perhaps hoping that some meaning could be harvested from the utter senselessness of her passing at the age of 22. Sadly it is unlikely that any meaning in hers and the “martyrdom” of other dead combatants of the NPA will ever be forthcoming. “Fighting” — much less dying — for an obsolete cause, after all, is not exactly the best pathway to lasting historical significance nor, at the very least, a “glorious” death (whatever that might mean).
The eminent World War II general George S. Patton was said to have stated it far more succinctly and to the point…
“No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making some other poor dumb bastard die for his country.”
…in the process highlighting (1) the lameness in the necropolitics of the Communist-Yellowtard Axis of what is today’s Philippine Opposition and (2) the whole point of war that evidently flies over the heads of their “thought leaders”.
The Philippines, not exactly renowned for its martial tradition (not to be confused with its proud tradition of Martial Law Crybabyism), would do best to learn what it really means to wage war. War is all about killing the enemy. In more technical terms, it is all about destroying your enemy’s capability to inflict casualties on your side. And, yes, in war there are sides. Neither one is necessarily the good or the “evil” as the tards of the Opposition like labelling political camps. There are only groups of fighters out to kill the other — which is neither good nor bad but just is.
In a war, we all want to be on the side that is set up to win — the one with the best weapons, the one with the best warriors, and the one with enough thirst for its enemy’s blood to use those resources effectively and without hesitation. When one side makes itsef out to be a “victim” in a war, this is the best time for the other to attack. This is why the idea of choosing to be a victim — which the communists and the Yellowtards have turned into their preferred strategy nowadays — is ridiculous. The smell of fear coming from your enemy is your cue to go for the kill.
Victims get victimised even more when they advertise their victimhood.
So when one dies in a battle in a war one chose to fight in, let’s all be good sports and not be big sissies about it. Soldiers are expected to fight well and die well — not be crybabies about any form of victimhood their leaders should actually be concealing from enemy spies. To that, perhaps we owe some credit to Rep. Cullamat who made no apologies about her daughter “Ka Rep” dying in the “war” being waged by the NPA against the Philippine government. But shame on her “woke” comrades who dishonour Jevilyn by making her out to be a “victim”.",Others
Why the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the Philippines is like a typical Manila rush hour experience,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/03/why-the-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-in-the-philippines-is-like-a-typical-manila-rush-hour-experience/,"Watching how the COVID-19 vaccine comes available to the Filipino public in recent days reminds me of the state of public transport in the Philippines. The service is inconsistent and unpredictable — all madness and very little semblance of method. Like the variety of buses, jeepneys, and all sorts of mechanical contraptions that clunk along into the line-of-sight of commuters waiting to climb over one another for a ride, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in dribs and drabs — even managed at the town or municipal hall level — originating from a variety of suppliers and donors and branded in a variety of acronyms and pharma badges keep the public on edge. Because there is no scheduled arrival, trusting a queue does not make sense to the average Filipino — whether as a commuter or as a COVID-19 jab candidate.
If you’ve experienced waiting for a train or bus in an advanced country, you’d see the big difference. At a train platform or bus stop in, say, Tokyo, you could read a book or play with your phone pretty much assured that the service will arrive to schedule. Knowledge that all are in train to schedule gives you the confidence to keep your place in the queue (where there is one) and trust that others will do the same. You trust the system and this trust is reflected in the behaviour of the community while waiting. In the Philippines, it is very different. There is no system and, therefore, no schedule to the delivery of any service, and so Filipinos are always on the alert for an opportunity to jump queue and put one over the other. Classy, right?
The way the COVID-19 vaccine is being rolled out and the way Filipinos are behaving like the proverbial crablettes climbing on top of one another at every one of the slightest hints of a pharmaceutical morsel in the horizon is a tragically all-too-familiar sight and collective behaviour dynamic. We see it in rush-hour commuters and we see it today in the COVID-19 jab rollout.
“Activists” and Opposition “thought leaders” as well as their henchmen in Big Corporate Media commenting and shrieking over the minutiae of the “issue” of COVID-19 vaccine availability are pretty much useless then — because they provide insight and perspective no better than the average schmoe in this mad scramble for government services. Rather than step back and see the systemic roots of this dysfunction and exhibit an ability to connect the dots at a macro cultural level just shows why nothing much changes in Philippine society.
Like the Philippines’ decrepit public transport network — World War II era jeepneys, reconditioned buses, and home-made tricycles and pedicabs serving as backbones of the country’s transport network — delivery of products that are critical in this time of pandemic ultimately originate from afterthought leftovers from the global effort — the pharmaceutical equivalent of pagpag. Perhaps Filipinos, long accustomed to a crab-like approach to accessing stuff and the mediocre stuff they get for that effort don’t really know what they are missing overall.
Is the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte responsible for this sustained dysfunction? Perhaps it is. Then again, who cares? Really, Duterte and other presidents and the governments they led before him all presided over similar situations. The common denominators are evident and shine through regardless of government. It comes down to Filipinos’ aversion to doing things properly and systematically. This jeepney-style rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine is no exception to that sad rule.",Others
Should “trans” and “queer” roles in cinema and TV be limited only to “trans” and “queer” actors?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/should-trans-and-queer-roles-in-cinema-and-tv-be-limited-only-to-trans-and-queer-actors/,"The notion of actors only of a certain sexual orientation or who “identify” with a certain gender being qualified to play characters in cinema or TV that are of the same sexual orientation or gender identification is the subject of much debate. Actually, thinking again, for many in that community, the entitlement is practically a non-negotiable.
For example, a certain Tina B who, according to her Twitter profile is into “Sociology & Human Rights” called actress Nathalie Hart a “homophobe” in a tweet for expressing her sexual preferences in the context of a lesbian role she played in an episode of popular Filipino TV anthology Maalala Mo Kaya (“Would You Remember?).
But was Hart being a “homophobe” when she aired her thoughts on the role she played? This is what the award-winning actor reportedly said about the role in a press conference she attended on the 22nd February (the subject of the screenshots attached to the above tweet…
It’s my first time to play a lesbian role. I’m very excited na nagawa ko siya at nalunok ko yung role na ito. I think I gave justice to the role
Here, Hart evidently starts with expressing what a challenge it is to play a certain type of role for the first time — perhaps something Tom Cruise may have felt playing a Top Gun fighter pilot having never experienced flying an F-14 before. Hart then goes on to say…
Ang hirap ng role kasi you have to think na you’re in love with a woman. Ang hirap talaga. Mas madali sa akin makipagtitigan sa lalaki kahit kaninong actor (but not with same sex)
Was that being a “homophobe”? The jury may still be out but, thanks to the characteristic shrillness of the “woke” Cancel Army, Hart would reportedly go on to issue a subsequent public apology…
“Hello guys. My close friends and family know how much I love gay people. I’m sorry if I offended the LGBTQ community, for the remarks I made which were taken out of context,” Nathalie wrote on Instagram.
Nathalie said she regretted her actions and that she “truly apologizes” to the people she has “offended.”
“I’m truly sorry,” she said.
…effectively not just swallowing this lesbian role she found challenging but also forfeiting any entitlement to a fair go at making what is clearly a valid challenge to the “homophobe” label she had been likely unfairly slapped with by the Gay Taliban. Herein is yet another example of how “woke” cancel culture effectively stamps out honest public debate on matters they deem offensive to their “community”. It seems there is no longer any room for any kind of challenge to perceptions of offense to people who enjoy control over topics that have all but hijacked editorial oversight over content aired over Big Corporate Media channels.
For her part, a certain Patricia Lasaten, a “Music Composer/Arranger” in a tweet almost gets it right halfway but should have quit while she was ahead…
I don’t think so.
The fact is, Nathalie Hart should have given herself more credit. She did not have to apologise for being honest about her feelings for a role she most likely pulled off brilliantly. Tom Hanks, for example, played a gay man with astounding sensitivity in the 1993 film Philadelphia despite being a heterosexual. It made him one of the greatest actors of his time. Neil Patrick Harris, for his part, is gay but played straight men most of his career. In short, it really comes down to how good an actor is and not his or her sexual orientation.
A transformation into a meritocracy is long overdue in Philippine society. It is this primitive tribalism and abject emotionalism that remains a formidable roadblock to that march towards modern thinking at a society level. This lack of perspective when regarding what are essentially non-issues will persist as long as infantile “influencers” continue to hijack the National Debate. It’s time the broader Filipino people put their foot down and cancel this idiotic Cancel Culture.",Others
"After “Achievement War,” Yellows fail to Prove that their Admin was “clean”",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/achievement-war-yellows/,"The way the Duterte-Aquino “Achievement War” rolled a while back demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of political discourse in the country. Although I would hammer the Aquino side more, I maintain the point I made in my earlier article “Positive should never be used to cover the Negative Up” that achievements by politicians are not a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Both sides are throwing out achievement lists to try and show that their president is better. If you ask me, I’d trust Ben Kritz’s article that compares the two sides based on quality over quantity, giving the Duterte side a little advantage. But for me, no matter the achievements, corruption or any huge mistake will soil any record. Political leaders should be punished accordingly for those, or at least should not be heaped with high praises.
But here’s why I would hammer the Aquino side more: the Yellow side is more cultic. In my article on GRPSupport, BS Aquino Fandom reflects Starstruck Ignoramusness and Wokeness, I showed how the blindness of Aquino supporters continues to this day. They continue to insist that BS Aquino is an unblemished, faultless saint, even if so many lucid moments of callousness and in-your-face disrespect of others were recorded.
Opposition keeps harping on Duterte, or even Arroyo and other presidents, as evil (it’s obvious that they consider anyone not on their side as evil). On Duterte, they keep parroting the kwentong barbero (barber shop gossip) that he maintains a secret hit squad from his days as mayor, never mind that this cannot be tried in court without any proof (Let me also reemphasize that Aquino himself likely had his own private goon squad and may have ordered hits, as I mentioned in my GRPSupport article). Just that contrast, the Aquino fandom insists, justifies preferring Aquino over any other to the point of worshipping him.
I think Aquino worship is already the sign of a mental disorder, since people are willingly blinding their eyes to obvious signs. You may call Duterte worship like it, but I think Duterte was different in that he never pretended to be the good guy. The Aquino side was the devil who takes the guise of an angel.
But as I said, the problem with Filipinos is how they treat leaders as silver bullets. They think, choose the right leader for the job, the “born leader,” or the clean, faultless leader. The truth is, no such person exists. There is no such thing as a naturally “good person.” All people are on equal footing and do either good or bad at different times. And, as I said in an earlier article of mine, I more believe that the role of leaders, especially national ones, is perhaps overrated and that things move forward despite more than because of them. People should lead themselves.
It’s a given that any administration should come up with infrastructure and achievements. Praise is best kept to a minimum for anyone. It’s the foul-ups that are something to measure and to harp on, especially those of the ever-holy, uninsultable Yellow Saint.
I still think the Yellow Cult still wants to do the dumb thing called overthrowing government so that they could take over and maximize their gains. They should be denied that.
The Yellow Cult also believes in the baloney saying, “when you are neutral, you are actually siding with the oppressor.” I believe neutrality is a legitimate thing, and painting one side as “evil” is just a publicity ploy. There are no good or evil sides in politics, only vested self-interests vying with each other. The recent spat between Florin Hilbay and Antonio Carpio seems to prove this.
The said spat also seems to be a leftover of the Balay vs. Samar days of Aquino’s term. I wonder what other things would come up related to this. It would be interesting to see if this fully exposes the “good guys” as vested interests and bursts the Yellow Bubble for good.
I wonder if it is finally making some Yellow supporters ask themselves how could two anti-Duterte people quarrel. “How could they not put up a united front? They’re the good guys right? But wait… are they actually vested interests working for selfish gain?”
Truth hurts. But if you don’t accept it, it can hurt even more.",Others
“Death by community pantry” is dead right!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/death-by-community-pantry-is-dead-right/,"It’s in the news and is all the buzz amongst the mutual high-fivin’ titas of Manila who are reveling in the idea that they have once again scored a Great Woke Cancellation. University of the Philippines Executive Vice President Teodoro J. Herbosa had recently tendered his resignation. News site Interaksyon “reports” that this was “after his tweets earned backlash from some Twitter users”. This “report”, however, failed to mention what specific political bloc or clique of “Twitter users” were the primary sources of this “backlash”.
“Reporter” Jeline Malasig who authored the Interaksyon “report” goes into some detail on Herbosa’s offense to the “decent” mob writing further…
“Death by ‘community pantry.’ I told you so!” he tweeted with an accompanying screenshot of a report of News5.
“Mali ito. Don’t even try to defend this is right. Daming mag ka COVID19 diyan!” Herbosa added.
He also shared screengrabs of a video featuring the incident and wrote, “Tama po ba ito?”
Herbosa was referring to the death of 67-year-old Rolando dela Cruz who was part of an enormous crowd that gathered around the ill-fated community pantry organised by ABS-CBN starlet Angel Locsin on the occasion of her birthday last week. One can therefore reasonably argue that Dela Cruz’s death was a case of death by community pantry. If there had been no community pantry on that day, then Mr Rolando dela Cruz would likely still be alive today. Simple logic, right?
The more important point to be made here is that the notion of Death by Community Pantry can be thought of as one that describes the overall macro character of Philippine society. Community pantry disasters such as in the case of Locsin’s “birthday pantry” are microcosms of the way Filipinos generally regard the nature of their personal fortunes. To the average Filipino, bad fortune is a punishment from God and good fortune is a reward from God. They manifest this fate-based view of life in their politics ascribing good and bad things to the rich and powerful. They move like flocks of sheep prompted by the “shepherd” figures ingrained in their collective psyches by their medieval religion and dishonest politics.
The “good shepherds” that organised these community pantries and the “evangelists” who drummed up the media spectacles around these are arguably what pulled in the dangerous throngs that put lives and property at huge risk. In her recent blog post “Privilege, pantries, and the poor”, Opposition thought leader Katrina Stuart-Santiago asserts that “encouraging the poor to travel from their communities, with the little cash that they have, so they might fall in line for a pantry where they are implicitly told to take little, is just unkind. It is also reckless.” She writes how this unkindness grew out of “a romanticization of the poor that is borne of a privileged gaze”. She continues — perhaps making reference to an ironically capitalist impulse to scale or industrialise an initiative that, by its very nature, is best kept small — to describe the flawed thinking applied to these so-called community pantries that ultimately turned them to the sad perversions we see today…
The decision to raise funds or ask for goods beyond the community of one pantry, and inadvertently encouraging the poor to come in droves to the pantries they see on TV, defeats the pantry’s purpose. You lose “community” and the notion of assisting your neighbors; you lose the time and energy you need to forge connections within the community, across the privileged and the poor, towards standing in solidarity, beyond this act of charity.
It is evident here and in the similar manner that Filipinos, their “activists”, and their politicians routinely turn what were originally good ideas into abominations as a continuous death by good intention. Consider then; community pantries started out as such — good intentions. Somebody died as a result of that good intention turned bad after the people in the jackboots goose-stepped into the picture waving their ideological banners. Death by community pantry. Only in the Philippines.
If all those self-appointed “virtues” that Filipinos take pride in really delivered real outcomes — our prayerfulness, bayanihan spirit, generosity to “the poor”, and all the chi chi man-for-others stuff taught to us up that Hill — were actually worth the hundreds of thousands of pesos parents of today’s “thought leaders” paid the Catholic Mafia to shove down their kids’ throats then, surely, the Philippines would be the world’s richest country by now. Yet to this day Filipinos continue to shrug their collective shoulders asking: Where are the results?
Oh, to be so educated and yet turn out to be so unkind — and so reckless.",Others
Why is the Philippines always BEGGING for stuff?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/04/why-is-the-philippines-always-begging-for-stuff/,"The Philippines begs just like a scorpion stings. That’s just what the Philippines does. It begs. It begs for “foreign investment”. It begs for foreign “aid”. Begs for loans. Begs for military support. Begs for military equipment. Begs for International Criminal Court intervention. Begs for foreign employment. Begs for rice. Begs for tourists. Begs for vaccines. Begs for ayuda.
Beg. Beg. Beg.
Why does the Philippines beg? Because the Philippines is poor. How did it end up poor? Because this is how the Philippines operates:
The Philippines habitually enters into commitments it is inherently incapable of honouring.
The above is the very definition of poverty. The Philippines is the definition of poverty.
It is a country that lacks any means of standing on its own two feet. It is proud of an “independence” it did not win in 1898 and is too proud to accept an independence the United States actually granted it in 1946.
The Philippines does not possess the capability to grow its own food nor distribute what little it grows efficiently. It does not possess the capability to develop and manufacture important medicines, does not possess sufficient means to dispense these and the essential health services to dispense these competently via an adequate public health infrastructure. Neither does the Philippines have the capability to nurture the intellectual growth of its people and, as a result, unleashes legions of unqualified voters into its “democracy” every year.
And yet, the country grew its population to the embarrassingly enormous size we behold today. It is a country of 110 million people and this population continues to grow at an alarming clip. But this is a country that cannot — nor seems collectively inclined — to defend its territory or feed or educate its people. It is a peacetime humanitarian disaster — a petridish where a virus that is a menace to all of humanity continues to replicate and, with each unchecked replication, is given the chance to mutate to ever more virulent strains. We’re not talking about the coronavirus though. We’re talking about an entire generation of Filipinos who would likely be raised on substandard public education, in ill health, and very likely be bearing their third child by the time they are 22.
The begging will continue. Money that could have been spent on infrastructure will likely be diverted to ayuda thanks to politicians both nurturing and preying on their constituents’ ever-inflating victim mentalities.
When will the Philippines stop begging?
Who knows, right? Habitually entering into commitments one is inherently incapable of honouring is a hard habit to break. The Philippines will only stop begging when it stops being poor and stops throwing money at initiatives that contribute to its poverty.",Others
How Gnosticism is a source of many of today’s Problems,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/gnosticism-todays-problems/,"I mentioned Gnosticism several times in my articles about wokeness and Marxism. In case some might ask, why do you pick on it, aren’t you discriminating against another religion, you bigot? On the contrary, I believe that I’ve learned a lot about Gnosticism that shows it to be more problematic than traditional Christianity and that it relates to many problems in the modern secular world like wokeness and Marxism.
Gnosticism is thought to have its roots in Neoplatonism or post-Plato’s philosophy and other ideas, including pagan ones. Then these ideas mixed with Christians beliefs in the 1st century AD. I do assume that many permutations or branches of Gnosticism exist and that many Gnostics do not hold the violent beliefs that I will later describe, but I believe that I am covering the core beliefs to a fair extent of accuracy. My main sources are James Lindsay of New Discourses and theologian Michael Heiser.
Let’s contrast Gnosticism and Christianity first.
Traditional Christianity – the belief that God’s creation of the material world is good; it is man’s rebellion against and separation from God that causes evil, so God came down as Christ to fix things. Also, man is not God, does not become God, and can never be God.
Gnosticism – the “True God” is just a force (use it, Luke), not a person. This force then “emanated” Aeons, beings that developed will. The lowest Aeon, Sophia, gave birth to the evil being called the Demiurge. The Demiurge created the material world, which had pain and suffering, and humanity. Therefore, the material world is evil and must be purged. But somehow, either Sophia or the Demiurge placed the “Spark” of God within humanity. Each Spark of God has to escape the created world, return to the Pleroma (the “Heaven” of Gnosticism?) and be reabsorbed into the True God.
In other words, man is God already and has to uncover the Spark within. The material world, being evil, is a prison. Uncovering the Spark is the way to escape it and become God again. Sometimes, the method of uncovering is to undo or destroy the material world. The ancient tradition of alchemy or Hermetic tradition sought to accomplish this by purifying with fire. Alchemists were seeking to transmute substances because they thought they could forge things that could be used for creating a Utopia. Later, alchemy got mixed with Gnosticism and became a way to uncover the Spark of God.
Another idea in Gnosticism is that the Serpent in the garden is the good guy and man’s eating the forbidden fruit was a good thing, because the Serpent imparted knowledge that supposedly helped humanity. So what knowledge is this?
Gnosis or “Secret Knowledge”
The term Gnosticism is based on the word Gnosis, which means the receiving of special or secret knowledge from the divine realm. A human who receives Gnosis might be able to release the shard of God from within them and attain divine power. In some movements, like the New Age, they think that finding God within oneself will unlock powers that they can use to alter the material world. But Gnostics also recognize that not everyone will be able to do so. There will be Gnostics and there will be non-Gnostics. Or, “enlightened” versus “unenlightened.”
I will bring up the question, how will the “enlightened” treat the “unenlightened?” This will be the springboard onto the problems that I see in Gnostic thought:
One: Us vs. Them
Gnosticism leads to chauvinism or discrimination. Believing that one has “secret knowledge,” “enlightenment” or anything that gives him a sense of superiority will make him treat the “unenlightened” badly. It leads to the belief that they are worthy of ruling over others. For me, it just comes from the backward tribalist attitude when a power-hungry person claims that he has the right to rule over others because he is just better than them.
Likely crossing the minds of “enlightened” people is the view that “unenlightened” people will be hindrances to reaching perfection, such as a perfect society. So this will lead to…
Two: Kill the Thems
Since Gnosticism’s belief is that the physical world is evil, some will come to the conclusion that it should be deliberately destroyed. And what is part of the world? Other people. So it will lead to some people believing that they should kill other people to cleanse the evil (while actually leading to the murder of innocents).
Nazism for example seemed to carry this out. As is often taught, the belief was that Jews and other “untermenschen” – subhumans – can pollute bloodlines and prevent the creation of the Aryan superman. To address this, the solution was to exterminate the “untermenschen.” (Friedrich Nietzsche conceived of “ubermenschen” or overmen; while different from the Nazis’ ideal, it still had the concept that man can become a super being and replace God, which I believe is why Nietzsche said “God is dead”)
But the idea of superior and inferior races is analogous to Gnostics and “unenlightened.” If you were “untermenschen,” then you would likely be considered “unenlightened” as well. Adolf Hitler was influenced by Gnosticism and mysticism since he read the works of Helena Blavatsky, one of those self-proclaimed “enlightened” who was most likely a fraud. Blavatsky supported the idea of Aryan Race superiority. Many mystic and occult belief systems at the time pushed the idea that some races are superior to others.
Another version is that “enlightened” people often think that their methods need ALL people to be on their program or be the same as them, or else the program will not work. This is also what Marxism and Communism requires, that all of them be the same or they will never achieve perfection (Why the commies say “true Marxism has never been tried”). Those who fail to cooperate are obstructions; if they cannot be “reeducated,” they are to be eliminated.
As I explained in an earlier article, in Hegelian thought (according to James Lindsay), the recovery of God’s spark from humanity goes through the dialectic process. This will involve culling and killing of people (“History uses and then discards people”). This is because those who are not conducive to the dialectic journey back to the “true God” have to be eliminated. The Hegelian process is alchemy practiced not on objects such as metals but on people.
Basically, if you’re studying how some of the greatest murderous demagogues develop and come to power, study the history of mysticism, including Gnosticism.
Oneness versus the right of many “Ones”
What I personally dislike with Gnosticism is that it gives rise to Anti-Individualism. Since the material world is evil, the reality of humans having individual wills, different tastes, different ideas and different opinions, is evil. It leads to the belief that suppressing the individuality of others is a step to Heaven. But in traditional Christian belief (these days, that is, being informed by rationalism and modern scholarly study), individual will is the established creation. Anything that tries to erase it is wrong, even sinful. That’s one reason Marxism hates Christianity (“Socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity” – Antonio Gramsci)
I have the impression that some Gnostics tend to embrace socialism because abolishing private property seems to agree with the Gnostic goal of removing individuality and merging everyone into a Oneness. Communal property is close to the idea of Oneness. But, as I would always argue, our individuality is an inalienable right and is the basis of human rights. If you believe in human rights, you cannot believe in Gnosticism.  I say that individuality is not evil and it is more of a blessing, something that makes life more meaningful and enjoyable. Non-oneness of all things is not wrong and is the order.
CS Lewis also wrote in The Screwtape Letters that the devil is the one who wants to absorb everything into himself, not God. Because, simply, if you want to absorb everything into yourself, you are uncreating or destroying things. That is the true evil. (As an aside, I remember fictional properties having something like Gnostic Oneness, namely Marvel’s Eternals merging into a Uni-Mind, look that up; and the old Transformers the Movie line ‘Til all are One’)
Marx et al.
The connection of Marx with mysticism seems laughable to some. However, many sources, including Marxist sources themselves, connect Marx to Hermetic tradition. Glenn Magee and Cyril Smith are two such Marxists. Philosopher Eric Voegelin was probably the first to see a connection between Marx and Gnosticism. There’s a video that says Hegel, from whom Marx derived his ideas, was a mystic. And, here’s something Lindsay noticed: Marx reworded passages from the Corpus Hermeticum, a major Hermetic work, for his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, which makes for an interesting bit of plagiarism. Last, Socialism dot Org in its entry on Dialectic Materialism says that “all matter is interconnected and interdependent.” Or, all is one. Sounds like Gnosticism. (Plus note Socialism dot Org’s heading: “We must seek to understand the laws of… nature in order to change them.” That seems to be a desire to change reality)
Now some will point to Christianity’s violent history in modern times. However, this violence is understood as Christians having deviated from their faith and so their acts cannot be attributed to the religion itself. When the wiping out of some (not all) Canaanite peoples by Israelites is brought up, the context of the time needs to be understood. A tribe is defending itself from various hostile peoples who are descendants of half-demon/half-humans such as the Nephilim. In that context, there was justification for elimination of those peoples. This context however does not apply today.
I do agree that Gnosticism was not developed out of malice and it more likely came out of debate over the problem of evil and suffering. However, the solution of declaring the material world evil and something to be undone throws out the baby with the bath water. Also, challenging reality proves to be unwise in many respects, since of course, humans can never alter it. Christianity accepts the limitations of reality and that only God can alter it. Plus, Christian doctrine, understood correctly, does not see Christians as having special knowledge or powers; the Bible sees all believers as equal under God, all equally sinful and needing repentance and redemption. Further, Gnosticism has a sort of spoiledness, an attitude that says I absolutely deserve comfort as I define it, so if reality denies it, it is evil. This is the kind of attitude that leads to atrocities.
Marxism and Wokeness of course won’t call themselves Gnostic. But the patterns and premises are very similar. In Gnosticism, the real world is evil. For Marxism and Wokeness, these are the capitalist world or the “liberal order,” the world as we know it. Reality itself is oppressive according to Gnosticism. Marxists and Woke say that the world we are in now is all oppressive. The cause is the capitalists or “Un-woke” people who are analogous to the evil Demiurge or Archons. To solve all this, Gnosis is needed; under Marxism and Wokeness, this is called “critical consciousness.” If you have Gnosis/critical consciousness, you should be in power. Those in power who do not have this consciousness must be overthrown, whether by violence or by other means (such as creating fake charges or gaslighting to have them removed). Those with “critical consciousness” will take over and will bring about Utopia. But they must have absolute power to make this possible; those who challenge them, even if these were “fellow woke” who actually wake up and realize that they are doing wrong, are to be eliminated.
Gnostic to Trans
To expand more on the woke aspect, let’s use trans people as the example. Since the material world is a prison, then trans people were born into the wrong body or a body that traps them. A doctor who looks at a baby’s genitals and “assigns” a gender based on them is doing so as an demiurgic or archonic prison guard. So when gender dysphoria happens, it is seen as the urge to break out of the physical prison. The person undergoes sex reassignment surgery, puberty blockers or other attempts to change the reality. It can be seen as a type of Gnosis or attempt to gain it. But it has been revealed that the trans person had actually been bombarded by other people, probably woke doctors, activists and involved businesses, to change sex. So there are certain actors manipulating young people into gender reassignment, actors who might have Gnostic beliefs. Or, as the “conspiracy theory” goes, transgender operations are a kind of castration. Reproductive abilities and even sexual pleasure can be lost after sex change operations, so it is suspected to be part of eugenics.
Back in my first Hegel article, I mentioned the concept of the Soviet Man, which is a development of Marx’s Social Man. Only later on did I realize that it was quite the same thing as the Aryan Superman. So Marx and the Soviets were also thinking that humans could soon develop into beings that could transcend physical limitations or rule over other people who have not developed their kind of mind.
Another takeaway for me is that modern Gnostics will blame others if they can’t get to Heaven or create Heaven on Earth. That is in great contrast to Christianity that says each of us is self-responsible on our journey to Heaven. And, Christians are not supposed to bring Heaven to Earth on their own terms. Only God does that.
Apart from Blavatsky, other trails of Gnostic ideas of “man is God” and “we have the power to alter reality” went into to the Word of Faith and New Thought movements, as well as the modern New Age movement and Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret. On the secular side, you have the World Economic Forum, “sustainability” (In the current iteration being used by the United Nations, this “sustainability” or “environmentalism” bears the idea that humanity can actually take control of natural processes as if they were gods, because those leading the efforts, like Greta Thunberg, are “enlightened” enough to achieve it; so anyone who is seen as not supporting this program will be punished by an oppressive social credit system), Transhumanism, Critical Race Theory, and more.
In Lindsay’s video on Social-Emotional Learning, he said that SEL is related to mysticism because the organization that promotes it, the Fetzer Institute, is a New Age organization (And the Fetzer Institute is based in the UN building, of all places). Another recent video by Lindsay saw Gnosticism in Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth, saying that destruction of colonizers by the colonized people is a step to a type of Gnosis (sounds like Marxism too).
Lindsay expects totalitarianism and eventually genocide from all this because pushes for utopia often lead to the snuffing out of innocent lives. Or, at best, it would lead to great emotional distress for many (such as those who regret gender transitioning). Thus, it should be resisted.
The idea that some people can be more special than most and thus deserving of some privileges is always dangerous. No wonder God forbid humanity from eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; it is actually the tree of “I claim to have knowledge that you don’t have, so I should be god over you.”
Quoting Heiser on the topic:
“I’ve read enough esoteric material and western esotericism to know that the short path to sounding intellectual is to spout streams of barely intelligible ideas. That way, you come off as the possessor of elite knowledge: ‘If you were as brilliant as I am, you’d understand what I’m saying.’ Gnostic literature is filled with that sort of thing. Just read it. My point is not that they were dumb or on acid. It’s that calling them leading intellectuals of the ancient world is silly. In terms of the New Age crowd, it’s hard for them to take reasoned discourse and make it sound like mystery and mysticism to convince you they’re deep.”",Others

The Japanese come from a long cultural tradition of precision and accuracy: their artworks draw from a very fine array of color definitions, origami involves the precise craft of paper folding to bring about 3D creations out of 2D material, and even their architectural woodwork requires precise pieces chiseled to perfectly match and fit with each other like complex interlocking Lego blocks. The best camera makers are Japanese brands because producing lenses that can direct light at precision angles belongs to a people who can handle micron-order intricacies.
Germans even prior to the age of the dreaded Panther tanks, U-boat submarines and Luftwaffe fighter planes during WWII, have been renowned for creating the most complex state-of-the-art machines.

The traditional colors of Japan are a collection of colors traditionally used in Japanese art, literature, textiles such as kimono, and other Japanese arts and crafts. In the Philippines, it’s simpleng buhay with just a choice of pulang-pula, pula or maputlang pula.
Japan’s Toyota started out as a textile manufacturer, when in 1924 Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom. Expertise in machinery spun off to cars when Toyota automobiles was started in 1933. Toyota Motor Corporation is so huge today it already has an entire city near Nagoya to its name.
Meanwhile on the European mainland front, Germany stands out as the supreme automotive superpower. A simple search on why German cars are so successful will land you at Quora, which explains why these former “Barbarians” (as the Romans called them) are now the kings of the road (while Filipinos stuck in their own world thought the Jeepney was the title holder).
Vivek Tulja, Aerospace Engineer/Scientist, Satellite Communication Expert says…
Germans practically pioneered the modern automotive industry. Here are some of their key inventions:
Modern automobile was invented by Karl Benz, Gottlieb Daimler, and Wilhelm Maybach, all German engineers. They were awarded many patents in the later part of the 19th century. The company that manufactures Mercedes-Benz cars (Daimler Benz) gets its name from its founders. Mercedes-Benz – Wikipedia
Back in the 1920’s, Germany had more than 75 automotive companies. Most of them either died or were acquired during the economic turmoil of that era. One of the companies that survived and did rather well is BMW, which was originally started as an aircraft engine manufacturer (hence the name which means Bavarian “Engine” Works) but soon diversified into motorcycles and cars.
In Japan, the “monozukuri” (making things) culture is so deeply ingrained in their national psyche. Only in recent years have Maker Spaces and Fab Labs begun to catch fire across the globe. Finally some ripples of the wave (albeit late) have begun to reach Philippine shores.
When you ask a typical foreigner what comes to mind first when “the Philippines” is mentioned. In Japan or China, typical passersby would say “Bananas”. In chilly northern Europe they would say “Beaches”. In the US they will likely remember “Imelda Marcos” for her famously absurd collection of shoes.
Despite all the poverty of material to show off, Filipinos will insist on Filipino Pride as the national collocation. Why the obsession on pride when there is hardly anything of intelligence, skill, and monumental achievement we as a people can really put forward before the international community?
Could Pinoy Pride just be like a form of national lipstick trying to mask cracking and bleeding lips that form the gateway to teeth that have not even been brushed and through which the tongue curses and defies those in authority? Could Pinoy Pride be just a desperate appeal to being accepted as a normal (in contrast to subhuman) member of the Homo sapiens species? Or is Feenoy Fried just an inflated colorful air balloon that purports to show some semblance of volume, loftiness and massiveness when there really isn’t anything much inside?
Why did the Philippines end up like a slowly deflating party balloon after the United States just after WWII cut us off from their umbilical cord? It’s likely that Filipinos have been too engrossed about their delusional struggle to regain political power, so that when they were finally set free they never got weaned out of that laban “revolutionary” yet colonial-dependence spirit.
Filipinos never really took the time to seriously reflect and focus on investing towards developing a national culture centered on tapping local creative talent and ingenuity and combining those with available and emerging technologies. They never got to plan out a national strategy or roadmap centered on first empowering the people with a culture of making and perfecting things, and turning that national mindset towards making things more efficiently (engineering) and effectively (business, money making engines, factories) to eventually create job-generating brands worthy of display in the international market.
The biggest conglomerates in the country would not dare venture in manufacturing road-worthy cars, smart phones, computers, submarines, rockets, and microchips. They would rather take the easy route to making money: good old Rent Seeking. San Miguel Corporation has turned its eye towards building highways/skyways and airports, and like NPA rebels are happy to collect “revolutionary tax” from each person to pass through their inconvenience-alleviating “investment”. (Why not assemble EV cars or produce lithium batteries?) The land-guzzling SM group is now into making high-rise condo units. (Why not venture into creating the Facebook platform or Amazon cloud of the Philippines?) All just easy money siphoned off flowing OFW/BPO/tourism cash without really tapping into our young promising pool of Filipino ingenuity. That’s why native Filipinos never really grew their engineering spine and precision DNA.
Even Filipino film makers can hardly produce the quality of graphics that can be presented before an international audience. We are stuck in the kilig (giddy feel), poverty porn, and elicit relationships genre, simply banking on the hybrid Latina looks of Julia Barretto and Liza Soberano. Whereas, erstwhile war-torn South Korea is now producing the likes of Space Sweepers and Okja which showcase the caliber of their likely Silicon Valley trained graphic artists.
So you’re a Filipino. Unfortunately, there really is not much to be proud of as a typhoon/volcano/earthquake- and activist/terrorist/rebel-ravaged country, or as a visa-restricted passport holder of those far flung struggling “China-bullied” islets in the East. We are only proud that (no different from sewer rats and roaches)… We Can Exist with or without your AID, and that we have survived one major calamity or disaster (natural or man-made) after another – surviving with a smile or a song, as a testament to Filipino resilience.
Without Filipinos making their own tech products and producing global brands the whole world will run after like an Apple iPhone/Samsung Galaxy smart phone, we shouldn’t really be parading Pinoy pride around the way the LGBT community (adherents and promoters of dysfunctional disgusting same-sex copulation) seeks and demands public acceptance. It only makes us look pathetic. When we express and brandish Pinoy pride through our capacity to simply BUY and IMPORT Audi sedans and Lexus SUVs from Germany and Japan using our much-deserved hard-begged OFW remittances (because these products of excellence are simply too difficult to make), we should really begin to look for professional help and question our national sanity.
If just one Filipino multi-billionaire with the wherewithal to impact the local industrial landscape will stumble across this article and make the game-changing decision to become the “Vingroup” or “Samsung” of the Philippines, this country will have some ray of hope of not slipping behind Laos and Cambodia in the next lap of the ASEAN grand-prix race. When an esteemed educational institution like UP or Ateneo can come up with just one domestically produced killer product developed using their ultra-high vacuum molecular-beam epitaxy equipment, then probably there is a silver lining.
Would it be too much to hope something will change within our short soon-to-end lifetime? If not, then good luck to the next generation of happy-go-lucky Mabuhay Islanders; you’ll definitely need truckloads of it.",Others
A confluence of Islamic extremists’ and Mindanao drug lords’ interests led to the Marawi City siege,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/a-confluence-of-islamic-extremists-and-mindanao-drug-lords-interests-led-to-the-marawi-city-siege/,"My Professor in Communication Arts Marian Pastor Roces is at it again. Mass media and society was the course I took under her back then. As one who is deeply involved in showcasing Muslim-Filipino culture to the world, Roces takes it upon herself to carry the cudgels for the bakwit of Marawi. She writes in her Now You Know piece “Invisible Marawi”…
Of the 300,000 refugees who took off from Ground Zero, those who do not live in refugee camps are staying with relatives all over the Philippines. Whatever visibility they had immediately postwar—in the refugee camps where rich and poor, friends and enemies, allies and the rido-inflamed had to pack themselves together—evaporated when most of them disappeared into extended clan assistance networks.
As a leading stalwart of the Opposition being a member of partisan group Kaya Natin, she considers herself instrumental in convincing Leni Robredo to run for Vice-President in 2016. She shares this distinction with singer Jim Paredes. It’s no wonder then that she blames the President for the delay in the rebuilding of Marawi.
President Duterte’s initial idea for Marawi was to keep the people out, hand over the property to Chinese developers or their proxies to create some fantasy Dubai or Singapore, and let a selection of the residents back to enjoy a theme park way of life.
This kitschy dream of progress and resurrection should be reminder enough that kitsch is the aesthetic Chinese fascism. (Think dolomite beach, Manila Bay.)
Those of you who haven’t spent an extended period of time among Muslim-Filipinos will not have an idea of their social mores. They have not adopted modern systems first introduced during the American colonial period. As Roces mentioned, land titles don’t exist. All of the properties in the cities have been handed down from one generation to another. Rido is a blood feud between families. It usually ends with one family being rendered extinct after all of its members are dead. This is why our Muslim-Filipino brothers value their firearms more than their wives.
Most of you read the news stories about the cash discovered inside abandoned homes. There were also the stories which came out after soldiers raided the Ampatuan compound. Muslim-Filipinos don’t believe in banks. This is why former President Ferdinand Marcos established the Philippine Amanah Bank. Every aspect of their society is governed by the Shari’a system. The true story is shabu or methamphetamine chloride begins in Zamboanga City.
Duterte was correct in stating that it wasn’t mainland Chinese who pioneered this trade in the country. It was the Taiwanese bamboo gangs. The basic principle of Chinese business is to keep capital earning a profit and the profit to be ploughed back in as capital to earn a profit. The Taiwanese came to Zamboanga to buy marine products which is abundant in the Sulu Sea all the way to the Malacca Strait. Later on, they put up clandestine shabu laboratories. It didn’t take too long for shabu to become popular as the poor man’s cocaine.
Islam prohibits vices but there are Muslims who don’t conform to the practice. The grant of autonomy during Fidel Ramos’s Presidency led to Muslim-Filipinos getting into the drug trade. The prominent families of Central Mindanao who were also politicians were the pioneers; Candao, Ampatuan and Mangudadatu. This was how the Muslim quarter in Quiapo became a distribution center. The Taiwanese used their marine products business to launder the drug monies and ship shabu to Manila in the bellies of fish to be sold in Navotas and Malabon. This was how the CAMANAVA (Kaloocan,Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela) area became another distribution point for shabu. Remember the deebeedes (DVDs) trade which led to the mass migration of Maranaos from Central Mindanao to other parts of the country? That was the money laundering operation of the Ampatuans.
The Maguindanao massacre wasn’t only about politics. It was also about drugs. The Michael Yang being identified with Duterte is not the Michael Yang who is really involved in the drug trade. Shie Jie Marine Products built a cathedral-like processing plant in the Tetuan district. I had the opportunity to visit the plant when I was still in the trading business. It didn’t smell like the traditional marine products processing plant. It smelled of chemicals which confirmed my suspicion that it was a shabu laboratory. Shie Jie is now operating as Millenium Ocean Star Corporation with “processing plants” all over the Philippines in some areas where there is no volume of marine products landings. It’s safe to say that it is not solely producing marine products alone.
The Marawi siege wasn’t exactly the handiwork of Islamic extremists. It was the latter working together with the Muslim drug lords who were feeling the heat of the intensified anti-drug operations conducted by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Mindanao became the center of shabu production after 1986 when it was claimed by Tingting Cojuangco, who was also fascinated by Muslim-Filipino culture. Margarita Manzano De Los Reyes Cojuangco probably envisioned herself as a Queen more than Imeldific ever dreamed of becoming. Her uncle, Ramon, had vast rubber plantations in Basilan and Zamboanga del Sur. Her factotum at that time was her cousin, la reyna del maricas, Raul. She built a white house resembling a palace in Cotabato. But as the pioneering business cum society columnist Vic Agustin would say, this is another story.
I’m sure Ms. Roces also knows of the history of shabu in Mindanao. This is only one of many because of the prominence of the personalities involved. But make no mistake about it. If Duterte hadn’t run in 2016, the country would surely be at the same level as Mexico and Colombia. Now you know why the Yellowidiots made the drug war to be all about human rights and extra-judicial killings.",Others
On how the politicisation of community pantries and ayuda contributed to Filipino mendicant culture,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/on-how-the-politicisation-of-community-pantries-and-ayuda-contributed-to-filipino-mendicant-culture/,"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the Philippines, “bayanihan” has been a mainstay of Filipino culture, especially in the provinces. As someone who spent my youth in the province, I am not surprised whenever the friendly neighbors come over to our place to offer some of their food during the fiesta or Noche Buena or Media Noche or their excess harvest of fruits and vegetables. We also offer to assistance to our kabarangay during special occasions such as weddings and birthday parties, and wakes and wedding parties, and even when sending off family members to work in Manila or abroad or when they are moving to new barangay as long as it is not that far away.
That is perhaps the reason why I was quite amused by the reaction of those in Metro Manila when community pantries began to sprout like wild plants in many corners of the big city, especially the hype provided to them, in particular those organized by Ana Patricia Non and several other personalities whose political position is quite obvious, by the partisan press. It is like as if the high and mighty people of Metro Manila have never experienced any sense of bayanihan within their lifetime until the appearance of community pantries. Poor souls if that was indeed their case.
Then we also have the various types of financial assistance, better known in Tagalog as “ayuda”, being extended to those who are in need due to partially or fully lost job and business opportunities as a result of the government-imposed lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19. Spearheaded mainly by the national government and local governments, the goal of the “ayuda” was to provide temporary financial relief while waiting for ways for them to return to work or find new jobs or start new businesses. The “ayuda” can be in the form of monetary assistance or, in the case of some local government, material assistance such as bags full of rice, canned goods and other necessary items.
However, as expected, some Filipinos pushed the envelope further by using the community pantries and the “ayuda” to pursue their self-serving agenda.
The community pantry was used by some as a propaganda tool against the government. Some organizers set up community pantries, deliberately made desperate people line up and generate long cues, and call their friends from the partisan press to make it appear that the government is making life hard for the people through the lockdowns despite the fact that the government itself is already sending out aid and there is an existing ban on mass gatherings to control the spread the COVID-19. Being the makakapal ang mukha individuals that they are, some even used the community pantries for posturing in time for the 2022 general elections, with them, although in a subtle way, sending out the message that they have the intention to seek elective office and those whom they “helped” should notice and perhaps vote for them.
The same goes with the “ayuda”. Akin to what happened to the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) conditional cash grants, the “ayuda” is now on the verge of being institutionalized both by the leftists and the traditional politicians, with both of them demanding that the government grant each family a one-time cash grant of P10,000 without providing a poposed pathway for the state to fund their caprice. A traditional politician, a notorious Bible-quoting political butterfly who used to be an ally of the previous administration but, until he was deposed from his high government post, is claiming to be a “Duterte supporter”, spent millions of pesos to buy air time at prime schedules at GMA-7 just to demand that Congress approve a bill, and, perhaps indirectly, President Rodrigo Duterte sign it into law, that would grant an “ayuda” of P10,000 to each Filipino family (that guy should have just used the money that he paid to place ads on Felipe Gozon’s television network to fulfill his goal of giving P10,000 “ayuda” per family instead of charging the “ayuda” on middle class taxpayers and ordinary businesses).
The community pantries and “ayuda” showed the ugly truth about Philippine politics and Filipinos themselves. In terms of politics, they provided convenient vehicles for those who have an agenda to present themselves as viable choices as national or local leaders because “they can give financial and material need and hope to the ‘poor’ and ‘desperate.'” It also exposed  Filipinos’ love for anything that is a free, a manifestation of institutionalized mendicancy and lack of sense of personal responsibility, which the politicos take advantage of since patronage politics is still alive and well in 21st century Philippines, especially at the local level.
Instead of community pantries and “ayuda,” what the Philippines and Filipinos need are opportunities to earn money and stand on their own. This can be done by safely re-opening the economy, and removing protectionist policies in order to create new job and business opportunities, especially in the provinces. Maybe the effect will not be felt immediately but this is a more decent, more stable and more long-term solution compared to Band Aid community pantries and “ayuda”.",Others
The demise of Spanish culture and urbanidad y civilidad in the Philippines gave rise to today’s IDIOCRACY,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/the-demise-of-spanish-culture-and-urbanidad-y-civilidad-in-the-philippines-gave-rise-to-todays-idiocracy/,"The use of Spanish words and terms in the vernacular is almost nil at this point with the new generation. Their parents didn’t grow up in households with older relatives from the generation where Español was the lingua franca of society. The mestizos are also disappearing from society. The third generation who managed to squander their family fortunes emigrated to the US, Australia and Madre España. There are no more watering holes where you can find them hanging out, playing poker, drinking or just shooting the breeze with friends like the bar of Casa Armas when Jesus Armas was still alive. Thus there are no more Pinoys who refer to the refrigerator as nevera, the newspaper as periodico, the toothbrush as cepillo, the dining room as the comedor and so on and so forth.
The art of cussing in Spanish is also gone. Puñeta lives on. But that’s about it. No more hijo de la gran puta, joder, jodido and jodida. The Spanish spoken in the Philippines is actually a pidgin form. I first noticed this watching Narcos on Netflix. Our sentence construction and idiomatic expressions are not the same as those in South America. More than likely this is the result of Spain sending over mostly Basques to populate their Asian colonial outpost. The architectural influence is also on the verge of becoming extinct with the demolition of ancestral houses in the capital and the regions. This is such a shame because this is part and parcel of the country’s character.
But it’s not only the language and architecture that is vanishing. The values of urbanidad y civilidad are no longer practiced except for de alta sociedad. Even the cuisine has been bastardized. El Comedor is long gone. Armas is barely surviving because of the pandemic. Alba’s is still open but it is not the same since the death of Don Anastacio Alba who you could see in the kitchen at his main branch at Jupiter in Makati during the 90s. Dulcinea lives on as the fastfood version of the cuisine and pastries. It’s only there that you can have a proper Español breakfast of arroz con chorizo y torta.
Columnist Jose Mari BFU Tirol points out just how ingrained Español is in our society. In his Inquirer piece “Español beyond codes, cuisine, and curse words”, he cites the Revised Penal Code of 1930 and our Civil Code of 1950 which are replete with Spanish jargon still used by legal professionals.
Now why are there Spanish words in our abovementioned laws, both of which are written in English? The answer is simple: The first one is a copy of the old Código Penal of Spain, which the latter revised more than 20 years ago; the second is based on the old Philippine Civil Code, which was an English translation of the Código Civil de España.
But like the Spanish words that have become indigenized, Philippine law and jurisprudence have, for the most part, treated Spanish words as technical terms which may have connotations that differ from their actual meanings. I submit that we should go beyond this, and strive to relearn the Spanish language for academic, practical, and sentimental reasons. After all, even the Philippine Constitution states that Spanish (as well as Arabic) shall be promoted, albeit on a voluntary and optional basis.
Recovering our proficiency in Spanish will provide us with invaluable insights into and appreciation of the literal language, and the nuances and contexts, of major Philippine laws, as well as the legal principles upon which our civil law system is based.
The new generation doesn’t value the old. Manila should’ve been preserved just as the Malaysians did with their colonial capital, Penang. Unfortunately, our leaders have no appreciation for heritage. Manila has been overrun by greedy parian real estate developers and informal settlers. Perhaps the message in Peque Gallaga’s magnum opus, Oro Plata Mata is true. No one was the same after the war. It became all about money and power. This mindset continues to this day and is reflected in the state of society. But I am left with the memories of what once was but will never be again. I have no regrets about being old because I have no intention of being youthful in the present.",Others
The Marxist-Hegelian Religious Cult and Wokeness,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/09/marxism-wokeness-religious-cult/,"I have previously spoken of Marxism in brief as a religious cult. Perhaps it needs a more in-depth explanation since it is a very interesting and controversial subject. It will be based on the explanation provided by James Lindsay of New Discourses who in turn was informed by philosopher Eric Voegelin.
Hegelian National Religion
It starts with the philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel (who drew also from Jean Jacques Rosseau – touched on in another article) who Lindsay argues is actually a theologian. Careful study of Hegel’s works and some pages from Marxist.org show that Hegel was trying to create his own religion based on Gnostic beliefs. Since he was a rabid German nationalist and statist, he was trying to create a German state religion (Germans seem to be often at the center of these things).
To recall, Hegel combined dialectic with Hermeticism or alchemy. Alchemy believes that gold is simply hiding beneath all substances so you have you burn off these substances to reveal it. Hegel believed that the world was like this but, instead of gold, shards of God are being recovered.
God is actually imperfect according to this idea and he is still forming himself by recovering his shards from creation. The recovery is being carried out as the material world wears away, which occurs through dialectic, conflict and destruction. For example, when people are killed and nations fall (Hegel said, “history uses people and then discards them”), the shards are uncovered and they return to God.
All this works towards God’s realization as the Absolute Idea. This explains Hegel’s Historicism, the belief that history follows a fixed or predestined path. At the end of history, when God realizes himself, a perfect Utopia will be realized on Earth. Along with this will come the perfect German state – perhaps also meaning that the German state will be the world-ruling empire (now you know where World War 1 and WW2 come from).
Hegel has his own version of the trinity, the Dialectic Trinity. As interpreted by Lindsay, the Idea is the Father, the State is the equivalent of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit is Geist or the Spirit. The dialectic process makes the Idea (father) go through the State (son), the state’s practice goes through the spirit, then the spirit revolutionizes the Father, and on and on until the end is achieved.
Gnostic Marx
Karl Marx, one of the Young Hegelians, a group of Hegel’s students, was a materialist and against the concept of God. So he reworked Hegel’s ideas into a materialist version. Instead of God realizing himself, humanity is becoming God using the dialectic process. The shards within creation idea was reworked into seeds of a perfect Utopia hidden within man. The problem is was how to uncover the seeds.
Marx believed that all the foundations of the Western world, including Christianity, individualism and private property, were obstructions to the seeds. They were considered the equivalent of the Demiurge, the enemy, if we were to apply Gnostic belief directly. They are contradictions that must be eliminated according to the dialectic method. This means that people should be killed (again, “history makes use of people and discards them”) to remove the obstructions. After this, the seeds would emerge and allow the true God for Marxists, communist humans, to emerge and bring about Utopia. Voegelin called this outcome the Immanentization of the Eschaton.
Marx’s own Trinity has Man (the realized Socialist or Soviet Man, not Man is he is today) as the Father, the State as the Son and Society (carrying on the geist) as the Holy Spirit. Despite using material concepts, Marxism retains the Gnostic process. It also means that Marxism isn’t a transcendent idea above all previous things but only a product of imperialist and religious ideals.
Seeing Marxism as a Gnostic religion seems incredulous for some, while others will say, this is simply a strawman by critics. They will say, Marxism is only a political, economic and social organization framework, not a religion. But a framework that encourages violent overthrow seems a lot more than just a framework. Also, it expects people to behave in a certain way upon implementation of a certain system, such as abolishment of private property. Based on scientific data obtained since then, that expectation is now known to be mistaken since people are not automatic.
Also, I believe this reading of Marxism as a religion by Lindsay holds a lot of water. He is quoting their own literature, such as Marx’s 1844 Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts and Marxists.org articles. His interpretation is informed by people who saw those connections before, like Voegelin and C.S. Lewis. Marx himself in Capital appears to use the word alchemy in a way that belies his believing it. Also, people like Hegel and Marx believing in alchemy isn’t far-fetched, because Isaac Newton, who existed in the same time period as Hegel and we know as a scientist today, started out as an alchemist. This was after all a time when religion was being rejected and scientists and philosophers were bent on creating alternatives to religion in explaining reality (remember Theosophy and Madame Blavatsky?).
It did lead to the establishment of the empirical sciences, because of which we now know that alchemy is wrong. Anything based on alchemy is more like quack science. That also means alchemy-based ideas are in error and should have been dropped as such. This includes Marxism.
But Neo-marxists continue to cling to their ideas, which Lindsay calls an act of faith. In fact, the Communist Manifesto’s original title in drafts was the Communist Confession of Faith.
The Gnostic Problem
Why pick on Gnosticism, some will say. Am not I just pushing my bias onto it, am not I insulting freedom of religion? Well, we have the right to criticize the content. Christianity, which I identify with, focuses on love and caring for others. Christians see God as supreme because if man sets themselves up as God, that’s where the evils and atrocities start from. When Christians murder and torture people, they are not following the faith.
Gnosticism’s central belief is that all of the material world is evil as it was created by the big baddie, the Demiurge. So it implies that one should “burn the world” to purge the evil of the Demiurge to reach the spiritual (Hegel’s recovering the shards). This evolved into the vehemence of Marxism’s purveyors and their willingness to kill or torture people. Also, my impression of Gnosticism is that it sees individual free will as an aberration that must be destroyed, with each individual will to be absorbed into “God.” In contrast, Christianity recognizes individuality as an unimpeachable reality of humanity.
Christianity, when interpreted correctly, accepts that the power to change nature and reality is out of humanity’s hands, which is why a supernatural God is relied on. Gnosticism led to the belief that reality can be altered by material beings; basically, Man is God.
From Religion to Wokeness
The ideological trail of Marxism into the 21st century led to a mixture with postmodernism, and so we get the various “theories” that include Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, Gender Theory and all other things called “woke.”
“Woke” turns out to mean being awake to a higher consciousness, which Marx wrote about. That consciousness is needed to realize the Marxist religion’s goal of “transforming” the world or remaking reality, which in turn is the essence of ‘praxis’ or practice. Notice how woke people like to change their genders, pronouns, identities, have sex change surgery, etc. This is considered by Neo-Marxists to be the path to higher consciousness.
But everyone has to be brought together into the higher consciousness or else the perfect world will never materialize. So in order to do this, the wokes attack everyone who disagrees with them and “cancel” them, meaning, trying to shut them off from basic services and their right to live – basically carrying out Marxist dialectic.
This is also why the hard leftist crowd often calls certain things constructs (social constructionism). They think reality is just a construct. How people see themselves is just a construct, male and female are not biological truths but constructs, a family is just a construct etc. Once they reach a higher “consciousness,” they can reconstruct reality.
But to Lindsay, to me, and to all those who are grounded on logic and common sense, all these wokes and Neo-Marxists can create is a pseudo-reality. What they want will never become real, although they’ll try and force it to be. Since their ideas are pre-scientific, they are detached from reality and, therefore, dangerous.
If I were told, religions and ideologies are constructs anyway, I would say that the constructs that justify killing people are the dangerous ones. I would certainly choose the construct that doesn’t make you destroy the world.
Some people will still find this Hegelian-Marxist-Gnostic Religion connection to modern wokeness incredulous. I will show in a later article more on this connection.",Others
Critical Race Theory and Other Critical “Theories:” Snakes in the Grass,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/critical-race-theory/,"Critical Race Theory is a hot topic these days because its purveyors claim that it is good, but we critics of it (pun not intended) say otherwise. CRT claims to address the problem of racial prejudice, which indeed is still a problem in the world. But it uses the wrong approach and in fact is itself racism.
Neo-Marxist Roots and Secret Racism
Pictured is “black rights” icon Angela Davis. She is shaking hands with Erich Honecker, an East German politician who was indicted for ordering the killing of 68 people who tried to escape from East to West Germany. She also provided guns to people who murdered some others during a courtroom incident in 1970. She was imprisoned for this and, after her release, she wanted to abolish prisons. She also voiced support for Jim Jones and the People’s Temple cult. She was a member of the US Communist Party from 1969-1991.
She is one of the progenitors of Critical Race Theory, along with WEB Dubois and Derrick Bell, and is a Neo-Marxist. Her mentor is Herbert Marcuse, one of the New Left or Radical Left I mentioned in the Hegel Dialectic article. She is quoted to have said, “in a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” Her ideas flowed down to Richard Delgado, Kimberle Crenshaw, Robin DiAngelo, Henry Giroux, Ibram X. Kendi and other CRT purveyors.
What connects CRT to Marx and Hegel is the use of the word dialectic. Crenshaw and many other CRT writers and leftists use that word in their writings. As long as someone pushes “dialectic” in their writings, you can bet your bottom dollar that they’re Marxist.
James Lindsay of New Discourses says Marxist ideas went through their own dialectic process. Marx first questioned Hegel then synthesized his own ideas from it. Neo-Marxists, because they saw that no proletariat revolution happened in the west, questioned Marx and synthesized their own ideas afterwards with a mix of Sigmund Freud. Davis and the other people mentioned above ran their own dialectic on Neo-Marxist ideas and synthesized them into CRT and other “theories.”
Back to Davis’ quote, non-racism is simply removing the wrong ideas that say other races are subhuman and applying equal opportunity. This is called incremental or step-by-step progress in the CRT textbook. Anti-racism is claiming that racism exists everywhere and is ‘hidden’ or ‘secret’ if there are no apparent signs of it, so you have to look for it. CRT claims that the foundation of modern society is white supremacy. Any attempt to point out that racism obviously does not exist in a certain case will be tagged as racist itself. Thereby CRT self-protects against any dissent.
For example, if a CRT purveyor sees a white person sitting on a bench and a black person standing beside him, they will say that the black person is being made to stand as a result of racist power dynamics. Even if the reason is that the black person simply paused during a walk to admire the birds, racism is still read into the situation. If you explain that this situation isn’t racist, you will be tagged as racist.
That’s yet another meaning of “Woke.” The “higher consciousness” called “Woke” also means having awakened “racism radar.” They can tell whether another person is secretly racist but other people could not. And you shouldn’t question them because they are always right, because they have the “higher consciousness.” However, sounds like a bunch of bullcrap, right? You bet it is.
Textbook Lack of Logic
Let us look at an excerpt from the CRT textbook, because this is proof that I’m not making things up.
The Critical Race Theory movement (CRT) is a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism and power.
The movement considers many of the same issues that conventional civil rights and ethnic discourses take up, but places them in a broader perspective that includes economics, history, context, group and self-interest, and even feelings and the unconscious.
Unlike traditional civil rights, which embraces incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law.
– Critical Race Theory: An Introduction by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic
In the first paragraph, the CRT textbook says that it is a “movement,” though some CRT teachers have gone on record denying that it is a movement. Next, a key word is “transforming,” which sounds like Marx’s line about changing the world. And “power” is something that Marxist thought obsesses over. As I said in my Hegelian religion article, this “transforming” doesn’t mean improving relations between people but rather changing where power resides. In democracies, which are based on the liberal system, power resides in the people, right? So guess what, CRT purveyors want to undo that.
In the second paragraph, CRT seeks to address the issue from a “broader perspective.” It means that it will overlap into many other subjects – perhaps too many subjects. Especially in the last part: feelings and the unconscious. Neo-Marxism applied Freudian principles about hidden thoughts or whatever hidden things are in people’s minds. This includes racist thoughts. This is why CRT purveyors claim that people can be racist without knowing it: the racist thoughts are purportedly in the unconscious.
The last paragraph is the good part. Quoting Lindsay again, if Critical Race Theory’s purveyors claim that their “movement” is unlike traditional civil rights, they can’t claim that they continue the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.
CRT questions the liberal order: remember that Marxism considers classical liberalism its enemy. The liberal order that recognizes people’s individual rights is also seen as part of the system that creates systemic racism, so CRT purveyors seek to overturn it.
Next, they don’t like incrementalism and step-by-step progress. So the civil rights movement is too slow for them. How do you speed it up? Revolution. Violently overthrow any institution that supports the liberal order.
It questions equality theory: so if CRT purveyors claim to be for racial equality or equality in general, they are not! They say since racism is everywhere, it means that it can’t be removed. So instead of pursuing equality, the goal is to control racism and be the ones to decide who is more equal than others.
CRT is against legal reasoning and neutral principles of constitutional law, meaning it is against the rule of law on the assumption that the law is inherently racist. Also, it is against ‘neutral principles;’ CRT is against neutrality and objectivity (You can link to this the quote “you side with the oppressor if you are neutral“). You can conclude that CRT is against everything because everything is racist, but once they take control of something, it stops being racist.
Then you have questioning of Enlightenment Rationalism. CRT continues not the civil rights movement but the Anti-Rationalism of Jean Jacques Rousseau, from whom Marx drew. Rousseau and his ilk are ruining our world.
In Simon Webb’s words, CRT entails the “dismissal of classical liberalism of the kind which arose with the Enlightenment, rejection of rational and objective enquiry, affirmation of subjective experience, whether in story-telling or personal testimony, sometimes known as standpoint epistemology, and a tendency towards cultural or racial separatism.”
Other “Theories”
CRT is not the only “theory” that makes use of the Marxist playbook, where you take a certain group, claim that it is “oppressed” despite evidence that the opposite is true and say the solution is for the “oppressed” group to take over.
I mentioned Drag Queen Story Hour before, which applies Queer Theory. The claimed purpose is to de-stigmatize drag queens and LGBT to kids. Drag queens are portrayed as an oppressed group. The claimed source of oppression is the institution of the family. Lindsay says the solution that is being pushed is not to incrementally stop “oppression” (if there is any), but to reverse the situation: make drag queens the authority. Drag Queen Story Hour eventually wants to take children away from the family and teach them the “values” of drag queens, teaching them to become drag queens or LGBTs. This system wants to destroy the family. It is similar to the communist system wherein children are taken from families and schooled (groomed) in another environment. The drag queens become a sort of commissar, the political officer or “reeducator” in Soviet terms.
If you don’t believe all this, there is an academic paper that actually says this. This drag queen thing is also sure to be a gateway for pedophiles to take children and sexually assault them.
Lindsay calls Queer Theory worse than CRT, but there is more. Before Queer Theory, there was the Marxist education theorist Paulo Freire, whose wrote that education is just a tool of bourgeosie domination. Freire said that teaching children to read, write and math is a method of keeping them in subjection to the bourgeosie. So instead of teaching actual subject matter, teach them that they are oppressed so that, later on, they could do “activism.” But this activism is not what we know, such as standing up for others’ rights. If you are guessing that it is overthrowing the liberal and capitalist order, you got it right.
Freire also advocated teaching about sex early to children, which Queer Theory seeks to do. Those who know about Freire likely also know that he was kicked out of Brazil and another country because he was messing up their education system. He worked with Marxist priest Dom Helder Camara, who is an inspiration for Pope Francis. But even before him was Gyorgy Lukacs, who became Hungarian minister of education and also wanted early sex education for children. He also ruined his country’s education system.
In the Philippines, does anyone remember that time a leftist lawmaker said, give us your children and we will take care of them? Was it Sarah Elago or Risa Hontiveros? This was the Marxist education premise being mentioned in the open. They don’t want families to raise children, they want their Marxist groups to do it. I do know at least one local leftist who likes Paulo Freire.
Also, remember What is a Woman as asked by Matt Walsh? Why did the people who were interviewed by Walsh have difficulty answering it? Because they do not believe the common sense answer of a woman being an adult female. They believe that even a woman has no right to call herself a woman. At least one interviewee even said that one should consult an expert. But is that expert a biologist? No, it should be a gender expert.
Basically, Wokes want to deprive people of the right to define themselves. First, people will be thinking up their own genders based on weird things going on in their head. But later on, they will have to defer to the gender expert who will act as a commissar, a Neo-Marxist one. You can’t tell people what gender you are, even if you follow nature; the “expert” will tell you what your gender is. Notice how they say, “gender is assigned.” They use that language to insist that people, not nature, determine genders. Based on that, they want to dictate people’s genders and sexes as part of control over society.
Even the anti-meat/die-hard vegan movement is going the Woke way. The CRT purveyors are likely trying to tell the vegans that they’re “oppressed” with all these meat-eaters around. Then they’ll say that the only way is for vegans to take power and ban the eating of meat. Also, I saw posts like “down with dairy companies” on one vegan’s post. But that’s not going to make sense when you realize that those same companies can provide vegan options too. Plus, the dictatorship of forcing others to be vegan is certainly a bad idea.
Another kind of commissar is the Diversity Officer or Diversity Expert in companies. On the surface they claim to make sure minorities are not blocked from employment. But what they are actually doing is stirring trouble up. They look for secret racism using their “woke consciousness;” so if they can’t find it, they’ll make it up. The result is competent people fired for purportedly being racist, frequent fights in offices, and toxic workplaces. People will also leave on their own because of them. Then these Diversity Officers will place in acquaintances who will likely not do tasks as they should, like a mechanic who doesn’t fix things or an accountant who does not count money. The organizations they take over will be turned into revolutionary groups.
Racist/Discriminatory unless they control it
So with all of these, what will they lead to? Remember the textbook quote above; wokes do not like incrementalism, so they want revolution. The Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 are one of the attempts, perhaps a trial run. They are doing anything to get into power, because that is the only thing that matters for Marxism. Again, to CRT purveyors, everything is racist or discriminatory until they control it.
A Youtube commenter said, “CRT is a big linguistic trick to get good people who oppose racism (in the traditional sense of the word) to, instead, support and/or engage in racism (in the traditional sense) whilst thinking they are still opposing racism.” Webb himself in another article called the idea of institutional racism a conspiracy theory.
Lindsay recounted the Morgan Freeman interview with Mike Wallace where Morgan was asked, how do we stop racism? Just don’t talk about it. Don’t notice my blackness, I won’t notice your whiteness. Because, why would you raise it, are you trying to discriminate? But CRT wants to go the opposite way and will come up with the rationalization that Freeman was only echoing a white ideal. They prefer that things lead to something like the Black Lives Matter riots.
Also, I have written before that “oppressed” people overthrowing and destroying systems will not lead to solutions. The French Revolution happened because of Rosseau’s stupid ideas and it led to a reign of terror. The Chinese Communist Party overthrew the ruling Kuomintang and ruined China. We overthrew Ferdinand Marcos but the problems that beset us then continue to beset us today. Tunisians overthrew President Ben Ali in the famed 2011 Arab Spring series of events, but the same problems remained.
Like the Philippines, neo-leftists had been infiltrating the academe and other areas of life in the US, and even in the UK and Europe. They’ve likely been doing this for a long time, so Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s was no lunatic, he was right. Neo-Marxists have been working their way into mainstream acceptance with silken-tongued claims while hiding who they really are. Also the same in both countries, and perhaps many others, is that this is being struck down as a conspiracy theory or “red-tagging.” We who are aware of this Marxist infiltration of society are struck-down as “right-wing” or “pro-Marcos.” Hopefully, people wise up, become aware of this issue and finally stop what needs to be stopped.
“Debunkers” claim that we Cultural Marxism “conspiracy theorists” believe that Herbert Marcuse, while in the CIA, brainwashed Davis through mind control methods. At least I claim no such thing. Davis was Marcuse’s student, it was just all teaching and Davis embraced the teaching mindfully. All you need is carry on the germ of a bad idea because, no matter who tries it out, it’s a bad idea that will cause a lot of harm (Oh, and speaking of germs, there’s such a paper as “Women’s Studies as a Virus.” See Lindsay’s examination of it).",Others
Humanity best give up its search for the Perfect World,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/search-for-perfect-world/,"I recall an address some years back by a Philippine military or police spokesperson to discourage youth from joining the New People’s Army where he advised them to stop dreaming of a perfect world. I find that sound advice that I hope many people will listen to. As I have written, many ideologies and philosophies were thought up since ancient times through the Industrial Age to try and create a “better world” or Utopia. In the end, they create more conflict and lead to more suffering and unnecessarily death, which is well-demonstrated with the case of Marxism.
Activist Charlie Kirk said that the most dangerous person ever is not the tyrant, but the ideologue. These kinds of people believe they know the perfect way by which all humanity must live by. But when the rest of humanity doesn’t agree, they get angry and decide, if you don’t want to join us, perish. To borrow from Hans Morgenthau, ideologues are likely the types who think, “let (my) justice be done, even if the world must perish.” I described their kind as those who want to “save the world” but they actually destroy it. If you think religions are bad, these are worse.
Some people will point out, there are really dumb people, like those who go out during Covid without masks, those who don’t get vaccinated, those who play stupid games to win stupid prizes. These are in the way of our comfort and peace of mind, so ideologies that are for the killing and controlling of these people are justified. Ideologues get mad at the world’s imperfection, they lash out and kill people. But the problems do not disappear. In fact, it only makes the problems of the world bigger.
Way I see it, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx and the Neo-Marxists, and even Jean Jacques Rousseau, thought their “great ideas” can solve the world’s problems. Everyone just needs to follow their awesome ideas to create the perfect world. If you let people run their own lives, they’re bound to mess things up! Nobody’s perfect, as the saying goes, so these “nobodies” need to be controlled by them! But “nobody’s perfect” is itself the reason no one should take complete control of other people, even for supposedly noble purposes.
Then they get so pissed with people not listening to then, in addition how difficult life is. So they thought, the only solution is to bitch about it. Ah heck with it, let’s destroy the world and maybe we’ll wake up one day and find it a Utopia. Things will respawn like in a video game. That’s not how the world works, but the Neo-Marxists and Wokes persist in thinking it does.
As I said in an earlier article, Marxism and similar Utopian ideas appeals to the inner savage, the sinful nature or the nature that makes us think “ah, screw it” and do wrong to others if they contradict. As it is a massive lashing out against reality, Marxism, not religion, is the real “sigh of the oppressed” and “opium of the people,” albeit a misguided and murderous sigh.
I also wrote that one of the reasons for destructive ideologies was misinterpretation of the Bible, namely that part about the Garden of Eden. Eden was thought of as a primitive Utopia where Adam and Eve were irrational savages, giving some ideologues like Rousseau the wrong idea about how a perfect world should be. Other faulty interpretations of this Bible passage include the idea that humanity was supposed to have immortality and be superbeings in the garden, or that Eden was supposed to have free food all the way and no death and pain would exist. And so Rousseau’s and Marx’s means to restore this version of Eden required the murder of millions.
What If
Let’s do a little thought experiment. What if some form of Perfect World actually happens? Let’s say, a world where humans are somewhat immortal and don’t die of disease or other “normal” circumstances. But let’s put in a caveat, such as, they can still be killed. For me, Michael Moorcock’s Dancers at the End of Time novel series provides a good insight into how that will go.
In that story, humans at the end of time have power rings that give them godlike powers. They can fly, resurrect others and travel in time. But they are also so decadent and morally base that they engage in games like depressing another through trickery and, when the victim commits suicide or dies some way, the victimizer will resurrect them to do it again. So they kill each other, resurrect their victim, then repeat. In other words, given Utopian conditions, humans can still abuse and torture each other. I think Moorcock is spot on with his representation of human behavior and it shows why it’s best that humans don’t have superpowers (a point likely also made in the comics The Boys and Marshal Law).
Some will retort, but humans when they gain powers won’t be like Moorcock’s characters. They will change their nature and become naturally selfless and all (what Marx and Engels predicted). I doubt. Reality has shown that while we almost have godly power through some scientific advances, i.e. the power to destroy the world with the atomic bomb or ability to split atoms through a Hadron Collider, human nature remains the same. Advancement in power and technology does not mean advancement in wisdom. This comes from something else, mostly values from religion (updated with post-Enlightenment ideas and recent scholarship) and common sense.
Keeping A Grip on Reality
The world is indeed limited by the laws of reality and it is basically untameable. Perhaps this is the greatest frustration of all. It is difficult to eradicate or even just alleviate world hunger because of the complexities of growing food and hunger being a recurring need. We are subject to disease; I doubt we can eradicate it. We wish we could enjoy sex or do things like plug a fork into an electric socket without consequence, but the consequences are the rule. People have been looking for the fountain of life, trying to be immortal on Earth, which some scientists are likely tinkering with in genetics; but I doubt they’ll crack the code because it may have self-protection against tampering. And so on.
Life isn’t fair, so people seek mystical escapes. Admittedly even in Christian circles, some believe hope for magic powers on this earth. I believe this comes from an aspect of humanity that gives rise to cognitive dissonance (as well as more misinterpretations of Scripture). Humans wish they could better cope with life’s difficulties in a magic way. We wish we could be in two places at once, we wish we could have many arms, we wish we could make things we need magically appear or those we hate magically disappear. Or, we wish we could change other people’s nature and make them serve our needs.
But, sad as it may seem, that will never come true. We can only work within the reality we are in. Life is full of compromises that we have to live with. But this should not make us mad that we lash out against others.
Anti-Entitlement
One of the great lessons in life is that we are entitled to nothing, including the pleasures of life, freedom from all pain, or even the perfect world. But we should not see this as unjust.
Dropping entitlement does not mean giving up hope on making things better. It is accepting that, since we can’t control reality, we should not be vehemently insistent and demanding of what we want, as these tendencies are among the very things that lead humans to hurt others. For example, when you don’t get what you want, like your ideas for a perfect world being implemented by others, you assume that other people are getting in your way and you want to put them away somehow. When it gets to the extreme, you would reach the point where you might want to kill these obstructions.
One of the greatest forms of gaslighting is saying that these “obstructions,” because they are obstructing perfect world ideas that could save people, are murderers. But really, is that connection provable? Isn’t that a slippery slope being applied as an excuse to murder people (and therefore the killers of “obstructions” become the actual murderers)? How can you prove that perfect world ideas will save lives? Is the perfect world really guaranteed by such ideas?
Dropping entitlement will make you not want to kill “obstructions.” It is one of the major milestones in maturity; in my own life, it led me to become less selfish, more understanding and more charitable towards people. One line of the Prayer for Serenity coins the attitude: “accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.”
I daresay that ideologies like Marxism are the product of an entitled attitude. James Lindsay of New Discourses said that Marx often depended on dole-outs by his Communist Manifesto partner Friedrich Engels. When Engels’ wife died, Marx’s consolation letter had only two sentences of actual consolation, while the rest was to the tune of “despite your sadness, keep the checks rolling, buddy.” This is also surmised to be Marx’s frustration with the world, wherein, “these rich guys won’t give me money, so let them all die.” This was expected to lead to the repossession of bourgeosie property, so Marx’s ideas can be seen a modus where he can take others’ property for himself.
Some may say, life can’t be worth living if we live in an imperfect world. This is wrong and is loser mentality. Humanity does have power over their own lives. A key element is understanding that doing good and “fixing things” are not a one time action that will lead to everything being perfect after. It is all continuous action that we must maintain throughout our lifetimes. While we may never have the perfect world, we can still work towards something like it.
Though life is difficult, it should be no reason for us to do wrong to our neighbor. We can help each other not just in the spirit of love of neighbor, but also by the Common Sense that Thomas Paine wrote about. We help each other not because of a social contract or state duties, but because we act upon the common sense to help each other uphold our inalienable rights.
Some people would retort, there are problems with capitalism and classical liberalism too! But the problems are not rooted in capitalism itself. They are rooted in human nature. Ideologies are created from imperfect understanding of humanity and nature. I daresay they are the products of human nature as well. We can’t change other people’s nature, we can only change our own.
Another of the great mistakes of Marxism is the assumption that individual will is the obstruction to a perfect world. Because individual wills often can’t get on the same program, they have to be suppressed or even destroyed. But individual will is a vital component of what makes us human. If individual will is erased and people made into drones, humanity is lost. Marxism and its derivatives are hypocritical; they claim to humanize man more, but they actually dehumanize.
Religion is also important because it helps us cope with our suffering without lashing out irrationally. That’s why Marx hated religion. But not lashing out is still the better decision to make.
The afterlife was probably thought of because Utopia cannot be achieved in the physical world; there is hope of finding it in the other world. Or, if it is to be realized in physical world, only the deity can bring it about. If humans try to bring it about, they will fail. That indeed has happened in history.
Keep “Great Ideas” Capped
When people have a great idea about the world that they feel that they should force everyone else to be on board with them, we should use true critical thinking on them. Are they sure their idea is really great? Will it not result in unintended consequences? Will it infringe on the inalienable rights of people? What will you do if no one likes your idea, will you curse them and think of them as stupid people? If a person thinks that he needs to force others to follow him to make his “great idea” work, you can be more certain that his idea is actually bad.
The belief that humanity can perfect the world is one of the greatest manifestations of its hubris. Humans are capable of thinking up grandiose ideas that involve the whole world, but when they try to put things into action, the law of unintended consequences tends to take over. And yet they don’t back down or reconsider their plan, but try the same thing over and over again hoping it will succeed the next time (Which Marxists and communists keep doing).
Something to think about: when people think of an idea on how to achieve the perfect world, they are actually saying that they themselves are perfect. Because, if you have an idea on creating a perfect world that is supposed to work, the logic is that you yourself are perfect, right? Perfection cannot come from imperfection. So humans who claim that they can create a perfect are equating themselves with God. And when they think of themselves as perfect or God, it often leads to thinking that they have the right over the lives of other people. No mystery as to where that will next lead.
As long as that desire for a perfect world remains, the tendency for violence and the urge to challenge reality will remain. That desire sets us up for failure. So perhaps we should heed that military officer’s advice on acceptance of the impossibility of Utopia. After all, the word Utopia means “no place,” its use by Thomas More signifying that it is impossible to achieve.
I say we should watch out for those people who believe they have the way to make the world perfect. Some praise ideologues as heroes, based on the definition that heroes try to save the world. I disagree. For me, true heroes are the ones who stop those who want to change the world.
My libertarian and “leave people alone” ideas are criticized by others who say, you can’t leave people alone because you have to take control of stupid people. On the contrary, what if stupid people were the ones in control?  Yes, they are capable of taking power. Also, if you really want to avoid stupid people, leaving them alone might itself be the best solution.
There’s this trope where one tells another “you sound like my mom” as a way of saying “don’t interfere in my life” (‘huwag kang makialam’ in Tagalog). This refers to moms, often old-school Filipino moms or parents in general, who I described before as authoritarian. They would try to dictate what you should eat, what music you should listen to, what clothes you should wear, what your opinion should be, etc. They do this of course because they think they know what’s best for their children. The problem with ideologues is that they want to be like this, they want to be your mom. But, as the saying above implies, only your mom can be your mom, and others can’t.
Some may say, I have trust issues if I refuse to listen to idealogues or let the “right leaders” control my life. I’ll turn that around: those who want to control others are the ones with trust issues, because they refuse to trust people to run their own lives, which is the normal.
Giving up the perfect world does not mean giving up on life or goodness. Not trying to reach perfection is not a surrender to evil. The imperfection of physical existence is not evil. It is simply what is. We should just accept our limits and know what we can do within them. Because if we try to defy those limits, we may do more harm than good.",Others
Why Anti-Capitalism is Stupid,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/why-anti-capitalism-is-stupid/,"Wokes and commies are all about bringing down the capitalist world, or as the Critical Race Theory textbook puts it, the liberal order. This “order” is being badmouthed as the cause of inequality, oppression and suffering in general. Such an idea is stupid, since slavery and oppression have been existing as long as humans have been on earth and is not confined to one specific group or race doing it to another (even black Africans enslaved fellow Africans too). But, coming from this, I’ll discuss why “capitalism” is worth defending and why the rhetoric of “transforming the world” as an anti-capitalist mantra is actually a disguise for destroying it, based on what I’ve learned in recent times.
Capitalism is actually defined as private ownership of the means of production. It is a scenario where different privately owned businesses, big or small, are producing goods without any need for any “authority” to direct them to. People are also free to choose whether to buy or not buy, which is more free than being obliged to spend on it by others. It is a “system” that developed naturally in history. In fact, I would say that what we call “capitalism” today is simply the natural order.
Karl Marx however wants to convince us otherwise. He and his followers today want us to believe that prosperity under capitalism is caused by a certain few who are in control of everything and had decided that it will be so. The world or certain people will be prosperous when they want it, or poor if they want it. This is how some people define capitalism: dominance by “capitalists” or certain evil people (changing the meaning of words is one of the tactics Marxists use; a fictional representation is Newspeak in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four). They will even argue that prosperity is an illusion propped up by the “capitalists.”
However, closer and more reasoned examination will disprove this. The few big businesses perceived to be dominant in many fields are only a part of the society where many private owners, including small ones, contributed to the abundance of goods in the market. The laws of economics, such as the law of supply and demand, are among the driving forces behind prosperity. The big businesses did take advantage of it and went up on the pecking order, but they are not control of the entire environment. This environment, the capitalist environment, enabled many innovations such as Fritz Haber’s nitrogen fertilizer discovery, containerization, refrigeration and others that helped make like easier today. The claim that a central power just ordered all of this is a big lie.
But back to Marx, who says this evil central power that controls capitalism should be destroyed so that it may be replaced by his ilk (he says the lowly proletariat will take over, but he actually means his own equally affluent contemporaries). Marx’s use of socialism could be seen as bait, to lure in people who mistakenly believe that it is “sharing.” Then he will switch to what he really means: the world population will dialectically be cut down to those bearing the “communist mindset.” They will be the true owners of all goods. It is actually like the Gnostic idea of the enlightened, only those who have “gnosis” will rule the world.
This is what anti-capitalism is really all about. It’s a power-grab by those who are fake “oppressed,” “enlightened,” or other identity politics buzzword you can put here. They claim to be or represent the oppressed but they want to oppress. They claim to be for human rights, but they are actually for suppressing the rights of the people they do not agree with. They claim to be materialist and non-religious, but their ideology is actually cultic. They claim to be the experts that other people should follow but what they are promoting is actually bunk.
Marx is twisting words and lying while making one big gaslight of the free world. It’s no wonder Eric Voegelin called him an intellectual swindler. And this big gaslight resulted in millions of innocents killed because a communist bourgeoisie replaced the strawman “capitalist few” and tried to control all aspects of life to bring about their own Utopia.
So we who are defending the free world from this scourge need to be armed with these explanations to counter woke commie hipsters. These likely believe that they can centralize production of game consoles, Starbucks coffee and luxuries so that everyone can have them. But it’s more likely that none of these products would be invented under communism. It’s also more likely that they’ll be enslaved under a “socialist” government that demands free (no pay) labor so that products become “free” (with no assurance that they will be given what they produce). Also, if the commie hipsters take over, do they really know how to run a society efficiently? Even Marx did not clearly define how things will be run once the “bourgeoisie” are deposed.
Let’s look at socialism. I agree it is another thing from communism. Socialism came from people like Charles Fourier and Robert Owen and they didn’t call for people to be killed. Communism on the other hand seeks to implement socialism by killing non-socialists.
One of the misconceptions about socialism is that it is “sharing,” so any act of sharing is socialism. This is yet another deliberate change of the definition. Socialism is actually defined as public ownership of the means of production. I had taken this to mean that all members of a society own the means of production and should be consulted every time a decision is made.
It seems practicable in a small tribe. But how about in a town of 10,000 people or a city of 500,000? Can you consult all of them for a major decision, such as through a plebiscite (“democracy” according to the Socialist mind)? No, having all of the public participate in decision-making is too slow and cumbersome, so a few will tend to be designated “leaders” who will make the decisions for society. So under socialism, these few will decide on how the means of production will be run. Socialism will still have an hierarchy.
A rich private person sharing things with poorer people is not socialism. It is just that, sharing. But some idealists will want socialist governments to compel more fortunate people to redistribute their wealth to the less fortunate. And it is a bad idea. Redistribution was never the solution to poverty. Trying to push for it will definitely run roughshod over people’s rights and cause harm. Supporters will say, the intention is worth it. But, we know the saying about good intentions paving the way to hell.
Socialism and communism will never give us a perfect world. Nothing short of God actually will. Instead, we best defend and preserve the liberal “order” and our condition of all having individual will because these are the tools that help us make life easier. Individual and non-state efforts led to innovations that helped make food and other needs more available (Fritz Haber’s fertilizer as a case in point) and life easier.
In James Lindsay’s video In Defense of the Status Quo, he says “status quo” is a strawman word made by the Anti-Capitalists to make the real world look bad and to convince people into believing the wrong definitions of things. “Capitalists” are preventing the world from changing, according to them. In truth, the real world does undergo change, incremental change where many countries have developed their economies under the free market. Non-radical Civil Rights people have helped cut down racism, abuse and exploitation. This happened under the capitalist environment on the basis of individual rights. However, anti-Capitalists think the changes are too slow or not enough change is happening. They’ll claim that the cause is they’re not in charge. Or that even the non-radical Civil Rights people are part of the ruse to give the appearance of change.
Marxism was a system of lies to attack individual freedom and make the state (after they take over) dictate people’s lives in all respects. Now we assume that the state in Marxism is made up of the people, as in, all the members of society as I mentioned above above. However, that is part of the lie. “People” under Marxism actually means certain people – those who developed “critical consciousness” or believe in Marxist metaphysics. Basically, only those who are Marxists. If one still maintains individual will, having their own opinion and interests, they are not of the people and deserve to be eliminated.
I have spoken of the World Economic Forum and claimed that it is communist. You would say, hey, a bunch of businesses are involved, so it’s capitalism! No, just because businesses are involved doesn’t mean it’s capitalism. Capitalism, based on my explanation above, is just private entities selling and buying. Business and government do not control (as in, compel) any transaction or motion. What they’re doing at the WEF departs from all these. Before I go further, I’ll have to set you up with an idea.
Youtuber TIKHistory said that corporations can be considered states. I initially scoffed at that, but now I understand. Corporations, especially when working with governments, can put out policies or things like “you can’t get this service if you’re not vaccinated or you don’t buy this other product.” That amounts to not only control over resources but also control over people’s behavior. In that sense, they have effectively become states. And since it is state control of the means of production and behavior, it is socialism.
This means that Communism and socialism will always default into an oligarchy. Basically, the lie is, we the “people” (the Marxists, woke, CRT believers) know what’s best for everyone, so we should be in control. Then they make a power grab for the means of production. Remember “you will own nothing and you will be happy?” That’s the WEF’s “stakeholder capitalism” wherein the few businesses will own all that the people need and will try to dictate lives of people (like order them to be happy). It’s like the Lopezes: they own what people need from birth to death. A new feudalism.
And remember, governments are involved with the WEF. They will help the businesses by enacting laws to force people to come under the “services” that the businesses have (another name for it is regulatory capture). Part of this is the social credit system similar to what is implemented in China. If someone “offends” any of the businesses or government officials or anyone close to them, they will shut off this person from the services (cancelling) and risk the person’s death. It might even escalate to the point where anyone helping this shut off person will themselves be shut off or even arrested (and killed). In other words, a murderous dictatorship.
That’s what “stakeholder capitalism” ultimately means: the “stakeholders” are dictators. It seems ironic but that is the ultimate endpoint of Stupid Anti-Capitalism.
That’s also infiltration, Marxism’s modus. Those familiar with Mao Zedong, Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse know that they encouraged infiltration of established systems. It’s not just secretly teaching and recruiting in schools as we know in the Philippines. It’s every institution. In the US, while they openly infiltrated schools and teach their doctrine shamelessly as “Woke,” they also infiltrated government, business and entertainment to entrench their ideology as deeply as possible. They will use these institutions to infect the world with their ideology.
Seizing the means of production was not a way to reverse the oppressed and oppressor. It was a means for a few to seize totalitarian power. The same elite or “less than 1%” pretend to be “fed up” and have the intention of saving the world, but are actually still acting for their self-interests. Marxism lies about wanting a classless society but it actually leads to the worst kind of class oppression. This is something we must resist. People are being taught to hate capitalism for someone else’s benefit, not their own, and they will get eaten up and thrown aside once the pretenders who seek power gain it.",Others
Who Declared The Philippines A Basketball Paradise??,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/who-declared-the-philippines-a-basketball-paradise/,"The Cambridge Dictionary defines league as a group of teams playing a sport who take part in competitions between each other.  That same dictionary defines misnomer as a name that does not suit what it refers to, or the use of such a name. They further define paradise as a place or condition of great happiness where everything is exactly as you would like it to be: Remember those three definitions boys and girls as I dissect something published by the Philippine Star.
There are very few things more moronic on the face of this earth as Pinoy sports media.
“In its latest project, the NBA takes a deep dive into the country’s love affair with the sport of basketball.”
Luisa Morales – Philstar.com
February 19, 2023 | 5:28pm
The usual suspects trying to capitalize on the pinoy’s natural thirst to be in the NBA. A thirst that has yet to be quenched by any Filipino native. The NBA is a basketball league that has the best players in the world which they cram into 30 teams. That league makes money charging admission to the games involving NBA teams , selling the broadcast rights and selling the merchandise.
I have no idea how Philstar extends the production of basketball podcasts with employees from ESPN, GQ, Foxsports, Spin PH and equate that to “The NBA”. Yes, they cover the NBA but just because Philstar does a review of Antman does not make Philstar Disney and / or Marvel. The NBA logo is on the Hoops Paradise podcast and is promoted on the NBA website. The problem is the hosts of those podcasts (CJ Toledano, Cassidy Hubbarth, Sarah Kustok,Nikko Ramos and Alex Wong ) are employed by the media outlets I mentioned above. If they all don’t work for the NBA directly then how is the NBA doing a deep dive?  They devoted their best people to it even if they aren’t their people?  The NBA has bigger fish to fry. A lot of media cover the NBA using podcasts without being the NBA. Usual KSP ploy of grasping at straws by looking at the slimmest connection and then exaggerating it. Didn’t I just define a misnomer?
The podcast brags about people they perceive as ” Filipino American”. Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was born in Illinois. He played high school and college basketball in Oregon. Neither US state is in the Philippines the last time I looked. He did visit the Philippines several times and hosted basketball camps because of his connection to the Miami Heat. The Heat website talks about members of his family that carved out a career in sports and no pinoy sports are mentioned.
Someone else that is supposed to give the people insight on how the Philippines is a Hoops Paradise is Houston Rocket Jalen Green. Again , he was born in California and played all his high school basketball there. He went straight to the G- League after high school. He is only 21 years old. I have no idea if there is a better researcher than can show how both Green & Spoelstra can cite the Philippines as a reason for their success or how they can explain “Hoops Paradise”.
The world never cared about pinoy basketball. I doubt this podcast will change anything. Download numbers mean nothing since we all know Filipinos love to stuff the ballot box when it comes to international voting. All that matters is the number of people who download who are actual customers of the sponsors.  Statistics show that if you are born in the Philippines or played high school and/ or college basketball in the Philippines you will not make the NBA. Only pinoys care about pinoy basketball and the NBA is the only league that pinoys give two flying sheets about that is not pinoy. This pinoy devotion to the game with the orange ball may be cute to pinoys but that is the best it can be. That tunnel vision does not translate to either NBA players or even wins in the international stage.
“To determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is it that I am not permitted to criticize?”
Kevin Alfred Strom.
When you read the article from Philstar, they want you to believe the world and the NBA worship how Filipinos love the NBA. The NBA as a league does not worship the Philippines. However they worship China as I detailed in this piece written back in 2020.  LeBron James , Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich proved that China ruled them by denying any wrong doing by the Chinese government. The funny thing about Kevin Alfred Strom , the Associated Press said he is an American white nationalist and Holocaust denier.
Pinoys obsess over basketball and no other sport comes close. No Filipino men have ever won an Olympic gold medal in any sport. Filipinos are invisible in other high profile team sports where many other nations including Asian nations thrive mainly because basketball gets all the funding and attention .They have nobody from here playing in the NBA. They have not even qualified for the Olympics in half a century. They consider it a badge of honor to be recruited by a league that has been only opened it doors seven years ago.  The PBA is unknown to international basketball audiences. Anytime the Philippines is involved in FIBA,  the announcers exaggerate their value despite the lack of wins.  The devotion is there, the lack of tangible results abroad are not. Did I just define paradise??",Others
Filipinos are SICK of the Yellowtard EDSA “revolution” narrative,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/02/filipinos-are-sick-of-the-yellowtard-edsa-revolution-narrative/,"Why do the Yellowtards continue to celebrate the EDSA “Revolution” when it was precisely this obsolete narrative that cost them no less than three national elections in a row? The mystery certainly persists. It’s that classic habit of morons — doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. It’s the very definition of insanity.
Filipinos are just dead tired — no sick — of hearing about how they were “rescued” from “tyranny” by a bunch of self-appointed national “heroes” who “fought” on their behalf. It’s like these bozos are gaslighting Filipinos into believing they are perennial hapless “victims” of bogeys only them Yellowtards can slay. They must continue to believe Filipinos were born in 1985. Well, even if they were, they’d be 38 years old by now and would be convinced, at this point, of the utter ridiculousness of that Yellow Prince Charming act.
The “spirit” of EDSA is dead. Well, actually, it never existed. It only seemed to exist because the Yellowtards ensured that an entire media-industrial complex delivered a continuous river of messaging into Filipinos’ heads that propped up the cult hero statuses of the Aquino and Cojuangco clans and their entitlement to power on the back of a mandate from God himself. The latter is thanks to the nod of the almighty Roman Catholic Church of the Philippines which ensured their flock was kept imprisoned in medieval standards of thinking.
Add to this the virulent “activism” of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) which maintains a vast infiltration network that ensures the (supposedly) brightest of minds of the lot are captured while budding in the country’s university campuses. “Activism”, after all, is an appealing hobby of bored and restless young adults seeking easy personal social relevance at a time when they really should be focusing on laying the intellectual foundations for tangible professional achievement — the whole point of being in university to begin with.
Let’s not forget the biggest investment in the art of mass inception of the Yellowtards of all — those countless statues and monuments erected to remind the public of the “glory” and “blessedness” of the Aquino clan. This astounding addiction to self-aggrandizement and the ability to secure the funding to indulge this with concrete (literally) works is a talent of monumental (literally) dishonesty. It distracts weak minds from the vast infrastructure of lies the Yellowtards and their communist cronies have lain over the last several decades. It will take no less than a focused effort of social engineering to dig up these foundations of narcissism and, along with it, the profound impact these have had on the Filipino psyche.
Unless this wholesale social reboot is mounted, Filipinos’ aspirations to evolve their society to a modern clear-headed one that can collectively achieve great things will remain severely hobbled. The Yellowtards and communists — and the latter’s terrorist network, the New People’s Army (NPA) — stand in the way of social progress. It’s time Filipinos get on the right pathway forward and leave these forces of backwardness behind — in the very museums they had built to the greater glory of, well, themselves.",Others
What is wrong with the Philippine Opposition?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/10/what-is-wrong-with-the-philippine-opposition/,"Indeed, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. The old adage evidently describes what is likely to be behind the interesting behaviour of the Philippine Opposition nowadays. After a crushingly humiliating rout in this year’s national elections, the Opposition has never been quite the same. It is no longer the revered “force of good” — a brand it once commanded in a conjugal theocracy with the Roman Catholic Church. The once powerful narrative that was forged in a “popular uprising” in 1986 that served as its philosophical underpinning is now an inert relic that lives only in quaint museums erected in desperation within tony private universities and exclusive enclaves by “thought leaders” funded by sponsors with vested interests in the old status quo.
A feeling of entitlement to political power was given a stark reality check by the Filipino people this year and a spurned Opposition has yet to come to terms with that. Unfortunately they choose to deal with this rejection by coming up with a bevy of demons that, they insist, worked against their crusade — “trolls”, “disinformation”, “enablers”, etc. Their attempts to lead Filipinos to believe that behind all these demons is a single leader — current President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr — is backed by such fury. To the Opposition, Marcos is the equivalent Great Satan that religious nuts invoke to incite inquisitions, jihads, and terrorist attacks. The fury of the scorned Opposition is indeed upon us. It is fuelled by a lack of personal accountability — personal accountability for the part their political ineptitude played in their own demise.
Unfortunately for the Philippine Opposition, neither fire nor brimstone is raining upon the “evils” of Opposition leaders’ fantasies. At best, their calls to action are heeded only by a minority albeit a noisy one — noisy because they have at their beck and call the Philippines’ mainstream media institutions. The Philippine Opposition need a new strategy that is more effective at reaching and converting Filipinos. More importantly, it needs to step up to the role of providing a good balance to the administration — not just in terms of being contrarian or dissenting for the sake of these, but more as a source of complementing ideas and points of view.
The key challenge for the Opposition camp today is to get over the monumental butthurt of losing an important election that they are evidently wallowing in. Sure, it stings to lose, it hurts to be rejected, and it is hard to get back into the meat market and compete for attention and relevance after suffering a crushing rebuke. Thing is, the latter is what it means to contribute productively to politics (which is a lot different to merely adding noise which is essentially what the Opposition is doing today). You learn from your mistakes instead of defining yourself by those mistakes ad infinitum.
First thing’s first, the Opposition need to get themselves a new and better leader. As long as they continue to latch on to their traditional ones — Leni Robredo who turned their lot into a laughingstock, Leila De Lima who is in prison and is not very telegenic nor tiktok-genic, Joma Sison who is hiding on the other side of the planet, and all the rest who are stained with LOSER forever — the Opposition will never regain their place as mature players in Philippine democracy. Second, they need a new narrative and a new set of friends. The Yellowtard narrative is dead (literally, in fact — as all their “heroes” either lie six feet under or are headed there). Communism is a mere sad relic of the Cold War and is irrevocably associated with terrorism no matter what the suits say. And the ol’ “helping the poor” rhetoric? Filipinos are over that as well or, more to the point, they never really did care about the poor (Filipinos walk by scenes of poverty everyday and hardly raise a fake eyebrow to express even token “concern”). “Concern” for the “poor” is a mere fashion statement that only students of chi chi private Catholic schools could afford to harbour. The assumption that poverty is a key election “issue” had long been debunked as well.
Filipinos deserve a better Opposition and not the one they had put up with over the last three decades and continue to put with today. Is there a group or camp up to the task of building a new proposition for the Filipino people? One that is more forward-looking and less of retrospective fear-mongering one that they are subject to today? Only time will tell and only a wherewithal to aspire to true greatness will see that happen.",Others
Marcuse’s Great Refusal must itself be Refused,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/marcuse-great-refusal/,"I mentioned earlier that Neo-Marxist Herbert Marcuse is one of the greatest influences on today’s Woke movement. He is one of the Frankfurt School, which assumed Communism had not yet taken over the world because of the protection of western culture. So instead of looking at what’s so good about western culture, Marcuse instead urges attacks on that culture to take it down. In his works, he created many of the modern gaslighting techniques that are used by the far left and Woke movement today to achieve this goal.
In his work, Repressive Tolerance, he said that only the political left should be given total tolerance and freedom, while anything right-wing (even if not actually right-wing) should be demonized or censored. So he helped build up the illusion that the left/progressive=always good, right/conservative=always evil. Marcuse also not only promoted the deprivation of free speech from those made out to be “evil,” but he also advocated trying to prevent them from thinking certain thoughts, basically thought policing, which leads to outright bullying of people in the same manner as a Maoist Struggle Session.
This is happening on the Internet these days. Anyone saying that trans people are not following reality and that sex is biologically based and observed, not assigned, is considered “right-wing” and racist and are sometimes banned or shut down. In truth, left-wing elements can also lead to tyranny, which was demonstrated in the French Revolution and many other cases where the overthrowers themselves became despotic once in power. Today, it could reach the point where Wokes would call for “based” people to be killed.
I believe that in Marcuse’s books, One-Dimensional Man and The Great Refusal, he claims that the prosperity of the capitalist western world and the recreation afforded people under this are merely illusions. This is the classic Marxist conspiracy theory that one centralized power is using the capitalist world to keep people docile or satiated enough that they could not do the work of Marxism. So Marcuse’s solution is to “refuse” the western world, overthrow the enjoyable life offered by it and embrace the violence of Marxism.
But isn’t it that people content with their lives that they don’t overthrow societies is a good thing? Doesn’t that mean that such a society is meeting people’s needs and life is better there than ever before?
I believe that Marcuse doesn’t understand the western market-based liberal world. This world enabled many kinds of recreation like hobbies: scale modeling, toy collecting, role-playing games, science fiction and fantasy literature and video games. Even poorer people can enjoy these things now. Music and art also flourished under it. The market-based world made food plentiful and living more enjoyable. And people decide what they want to enjoy, it is not determined for them by others. I see nothing illusory or wrong about this. None of these would flourish under a communist society (well, when Russian band Alyans came out with the synthpop song Na Zare in 1987, I guess it was because of Gorbachev’s ‘glasnost’ at the time).
But why does Marcuse see it as illusory? Simple: the non-illusory world for him is the Communist one. He fails to accept that people really enjoy and have relatively better lives under a world where goods are traded, not handed out, and where individuals have the right over their own lives. It seems to me that Marcuse wants all work and no play – which makes Herb a dull boy.
Marcuse also promoted infiltrating popular culture, using it to destroy the Western world from within, something I believe is drawn from Antonio Gramsci. Part of this is the hijacking of fictional properties (Lord of the Rings, Marvel comics, etc.) to try and insert their Marxist messages in them and try to get revolution going. Good thing some people have seen it and are calling it out.
I mentioned before that American communist and Black Lives Matter figure Angela Davis was Marcuse’s protege. She carries on the attempts to paint and gaslight the free, market-based world as “evil” and everyone who supports it as oppressors. Many critical theories, including Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory and more, carry on this program.
Marcuse advocated for sexual liberation (his book Eros and Civilization), and there’s an irony here. It’s not really for sexual enjoyment only. Marcuse and other people, applying Sigmund Freud’s ideas, saw that sex was something that society was often prudish about. For example, most parents would caution children against casual sex. Marcuse and other Neo-Marxists saw this as something to get the children riled up about so they can overthrow western society. Hey, kids, if your parents keep banning you from having sex, then you should rebel against them! And, when rebelling, kids, join us Marxists! That’s what you see affecting LGBTs and leading to something like Drag Queen Story Hour.
In true Marxist fashion, Marcuse takes something and tries to convince you that it is other than what it really is. He claims big oppression exists where there is none or little and reverses good and evil. He comes out as a wannabe dictator who is wrapped up in his own world and could not see the truth. Or, he is like the really old-fashioned people who believe that young people should not be allowed free time or recreation but instead should be conscripted for work elsewhere. I wonder if Marcuse was merely jealous of people who were happy with their lives and all his writings are just a projection of it.
James Lindsay however wondered if Marcuse would have thought differently had he known about the failure of Mao-era China and its many deaths. Marcuse praised China in his writing, but he did not know yet about the millions killed by famine, the Red Guard and other communism-inspired actions, since news about this came after his death. One could only speculate, but certainly this history of China should be kept in the annals and carefully studied as among the bad examples all should avoid.
Recently, Marcuse was mentioned in a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) document titled “Knowledge-driven actions: transforming higher education for global sustainability.” The document seeks to require universities to teach sustainability. It sounds good at first, but Lindsay said that “sustainability” is the new tyranny, because requirements will be forced onto people. Anyone who refuses to follow will be imposed with social credit sanctions similar to what is happening in China. Lindsay also expressed his shock at seeing Marcuse mentioned in a UN document, and the document even mentioned how riots occurred because of him. And yet the document does not condemn Marcuse’s part in those events; instead it seeks to apply Marcuse’s ideas further, in a sense like, maybe we’ll get it right this time. I doubt they will. But it also means that Marxists are in the UN and are going to make a mess of things.
Some will point to problems with the capitalist world and I agree there are some, it’s not perfect. But the real world itself isn’t perfect anyway. And Marcuse’s ideas are not the solution; they are the germ of bad ideas that will only make things worse. Like most attempts at Utopia, his proposal is likely to lead to Hell. Enjoying ourselves in this market-based economy is not wrong and only needs to be tempered with the application of values and personal responsibility. The sexual liberation Marcuse (although I do recognize other figures like Alfred Kinsey and Wilhelm Reich) promotes will only spread more perversion and has been used to promote cognitively dissonant ideas, such as transgender ideology.
Lindsay however points out a seeming self-contradiction in Marcuse’s work. Marcuse himself warns about the danger of being right-wing when one is in power. However, when you follow Marcuse’s ideas, you will inevitably become right-wing. So Lindsay implies that Marcuse has either forgotten his own ideas or opposing himself. Perhaps that’s why Paolo Freire, yet another crackpot, suggests always going left even when you are in power. Keep doing the revolution even if you’ve already done it. Freire’s ideas are messing American education up as result, but that’s a story for another day.
Marcuse is one of the enemies in Karl Popper’s The Open Society and Its Enemies, the ones we should not tolerate because they are exactly the ones whose ideas and actions seek the destruction and takeover of the comfortable world that we know. The Great Refusal must be turned on Marcuse; his work and ideas must be challenged and blocked, although we can study them as cautionary tales. Of course, there are his cohorts in the Frankfurt School like Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and other bad idea makers like Gramsci and Gyorgy Lukacs. We must also do the same to ideas by Rousseau, Hegel, Mao and more, anyone whose ideas have imagined that the way to the perfect world is to destroy the classical liberalist and market-based free world.",Others
Don’t you just HATE jeepneys?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/dont-you-just-hate-jeepneys/,"Recent activities being organised by communist front organisations further exhibit the utter hypocrisy of Filipino “activists”. Whilst these bozos claim to be on the side of the masa, they “fight” on the side of the very community and industry that makes the lives of ordinary working Filipinos a living hell.
Jeepneys represent everything that is wrong with the Philippines. They are relics — no, perversions — of the Philippines’ colonial past. They are machines that are romanticised as examples of “Filipino ingenuity” but are, in reality, proof of the opposite and truer fact of the Philippines’ intellectual bankruptcy. Jeepney drivers are the worst drivers on Philippine roads. Their boorish and uncivic behaviours are tolerated by their fellow motorists with clenched jaws and they are given vast latitude by city bureaucrats to keep their unsafe, smoke belching, and dangerous vehicles on the road.
It baffles normal people to no end why these affronts to modern society have been tolerated by Filipinos for so long. Even worse, powerful elements backed by the nation’s wokedom and communist elements emotionally blackmail politicians to quash efforts to eradicate them for good. Current president Bongbong Marcos is one such politician. Under pressure from the Philippines’ “activist” mouthpieces, Marcos had softened his stance on jeepney modernisation. This is following messaging laced with bleeding heart “testimonials” from those “poor” folk who will supposedly be impacted by this initiative. Top newsletter of wokedom Rappler, for example, issued an article peppered with inserted quotes from jeepney drivers cherry picked from Manila’s streets and, of course, liberal use of references to the communist-infiltrated transport group Pinagkaisang Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (PISTON)…
“The compulsory franchise consolidation is an entry point for the corporate capture of small-capacity public transport as only huge corporations have the financial capacity to purchase the required 15 minibuses to operate a single route without being buried in debt,” said PISTON in a statement.
Have mainstream media groups given enough space and bandwidth to news and op-ed pieces that weigh in on the matter from the perspective of ordinary commuters? Perhaps they did at one time or another. But not in these days when their top “opinion-shapers” are enjoined to be in “solidarity” with the “poor” jeepney drivers and rally behind their “plight”.
For some perspective, the Inquirer reports that there are roughly 100,000 jeepney operators in the Philippines of which “40,000 are in Metro Manila”. A recent study, on the other hand, estimates the total number of Filipinos who use jeepneys at almost 9 million. One can easily see the disconnect here. A cohort that accounts for just one percent of the population of stakeholders in this issue attracts the lion’s share of “activist” rhetoric.
Don’t you just hate these people?
To add insult to the decades-long injury of the Filipino commuting public is the way these “activists” paint romantic pictures around these derelict vehicles and the system they comprise. Inquirer columnist Anna Cristina Tuazon described them in a recent piece as if they were some sort of national treasure…
Culturally, the jeepney is known for its colorful and varied design, each operator making the jeepney truly their own. We see portraits of their loved ones as a reminder that behind each vehicle is a Filipino family. They proudly paint on words that inspire them and motivate them to keep going. Jeepney operators take great pains to rise above the chaotic mass on the streets and make sure that they were seen. The modernization program as it stands strips the jeepney of their individuality and washes away their stories.
Excuse me while I throw up.
This is classic tyranny of the shrill. Shrill people use dishonest appeals to emotion to ensure all the wrong arguments win. It’s time people with more level heads respond to them with a resounding shut up. As other countries in the region move on to bigger and better things, the Philippines remains imprisoned by its debilitating heritage of smallness. It’s time Filipinos put their collective foot down and put an end to this culture of mediocrity.",Others
Tagalog is a mere dialect,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/tagalog-is-a-mere-dialect/,"The Tagalog dialect is the pale basis for “Filipino” which is a variant of it Filipinos were led to believe is their “national language”. This is why Manila — which started as a Tagalog settlement that was turned into a colonial outpost by the Spaniards — is referred to as “Imperial Manila”. That’s because non-Tagalogs continue to regard the force feeding of the Tagalog dialect down their throats as modern imperialism. Indeed, most Filipinos can’t even speak the Tagalog dialect properly!
Even as Filipinos quibble over what Tagalog really is, it seems that there really is no point to this “debate”. John McWhorter in his article “What’s a Language, Anyway?” published in The Atlantic observes…
Faced with the question, linguists like to repeat the grand old observation of the linguist and Yiddishist Max Weinreich, that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.”
But surely the difference is deeper than a snappy aphorism suggests. The very fact that “language” and “dialect” persist as separate concepts implies that linguists can make tidy distinctions for speech varieties worldwide. But in fact, there is no objective difference between the two: Any attempt you make to impose that kind of order on reality falls apart in the face of real evidence.
But then, M. Theresa Centeno Savella, senior lecturer at the Department of Asian Studies at Cornell University writes…
From strictly linguistic point of view, Filipino and Tagalog are varieties or dialects of the same language. They share a big bulk of common lexical items and they have very similar grammatical structures.
It therefore comes across as baffling why certain “academics” consider it a big deal..
https://twitter.com/znsuzara/status/1634725184631615489?t=bWgwzlMzRgXMsr_eqrmHGA&s=19
When one considers how Filipinos, such as the author of the above tweet, a certain Zyza Nadine Suzara who is “executive director” of the “Institute for Leadership, Empowerment and Democracy” (iLead) issue shrill opinions on the matter all over social media, it becomes evident that a big point is being missed when discussing Tagalog’s place in the scheme of things. It seems the idea that 110 million Filipinos embrace (debatably so) Tagalog as their national lingua franca is the only reason it is glibly regarded a “language”. Thing is, its number of speakers does not necessarily make Tagalog a great medium for communication any more than cockroaches outnumbering people a thousand to one don’t necessarily make them a great animal.
The better topic Filipino “thought leaders” could spend their time chattering about would be how best to fatten the pipeline of relevant knowledge flowing into Philippine society. The trouble with Tagalog and other Philippine dialects, is that these don’t offer any significant body of useful knowledge that could equip Filipinos to thrive in the modern world. Indeed, just in the field of public transport, Filipinos remain trapped in the decades-long “debate” over whether or not their beloved jeepney should be junked in favour of more modern mass transit systems. Perhaps it is their quaint Tagalog dialect which lacks a word for efficiency that imprisons this chatter within such a tiny square.
Why continue to squander resources propping up a quaint dialect that does not contribute to Filipinos’ collective ability to participate in today’s competitive world. It’s time Filipinos ditch their heritage of smallness and embrace real languages that help them move forward rather than keep them chained to useless tradition.",Others
Has the quality of Filipino thinking progressed?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/has-the-quality-of-filipino-thinking-progressed/,"We’re coming to the end of the first quarter of the 21st Century and the question remains as easy to answer as ever. The biggest red flag (literally) is the continued significant presence of communists in Philippine politics and in the terrorism they sustain in the countryside. Why do these elements continue to figure prominently in the Opposition and why do less radical “liberals” continue to be in bed with them during elections? The mystery persists…
This brings us to the continued use of the “Martial Law Years” as a pillar of the Opposition narrative. The Philippines’ political discourse remains trapped in a bipolar conflict involving two key cohorts. On one end are the more forward-looking visionaries who appreciate that the future fortunes of Philippine society lie in modern thinking. On the other end are those whose minds remain imprisoned in old narratives on victimhood under the hands of perceived “imperialists”. To the latter, Filipinos remain poor because of such externalities. The solutions all lie in changing the influence of these externalities on society and not in any inherent ability within said society to get on top of the issues that hinder said progress.
A recent example of this sort of primitive thinking is on exhibit today. After suffering a catastrophic defeat in the 2022 national elections, the foremost “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition choose to blame “disinformation” and other “sinister forces” for their loss. There seems to be no evidence of any collective effort on their part to look inward to examine their collective character and ask:
Why did the majority of Filipinos vote against us?
A clue to this ignorance lies in the state of education in the Philippines and, to some extent, the way the average Filipino is raised. A lack of a healthy regard for habitual systematic testing of one’s ideas against reality is prevalent in how Filipinos conduct themselves. At its simplest, it seems they are unable to distinguish between (1) actually knowing so and (2) merely being told so. Could it be that, despite its members being literate, Filipino society still essentially remains stuck in an oral tradition?
This is actually possible considering that it can be observed across the board that Filipinos’ pre-colonial character stubbornly persists in a world that has embraced the required disciplines and precision essential to thriving in a modern technological world. So, despite timekeeping technology accurate to split seconds, Filipinos still live by their mammaya-maya regard for planning. Clear evidence of this is how their train systems run on a best-effort basis rather than to a fixed predictable schedule. And then there is the preferred manner with which Filipinos acquire information. Rather than read and evaluate the validity of what they read, they would rather defer to the word of people with credentials often failing to realise that the purest form of credentialism — absolute monarchies — thrived for centuries precisely on the back of that archaic ethic. Thus it is hardly surprising that a perverse oral tradition that accounts for the longevity of obsolete political narratives characterises election campaigns in the Philippines. Filipinos, quite simply, can’t read and would rather learn from what they are told by people with the “right” credentials.
On the surface Philippine society looks “modern”. The country’s large cities sport gleaming skyscrapers. Filipinos practice “democracy”. A “woke” culture that apes Western coastal liberals thrives in affluent enclaves. Yet, underneath all that, the society remains profoundly primitive. Manual labour is still preferred over capital to get things done (i.e. the proverbial hauling water in buckets rather than building pipes). Public transport, though motorised, is a bottom-up chaos rather than a top-down engineered system. Feudalism and cults of personality underpin democratic practice — famously evident in the general meaninglessness of most political parties.
Perhaps this is the reason why no amount of “democracy” makes Philippine society fairer, no amount of literacy makes Filipinos more intelligent, and no amount of technology makes their economy more productive. It’s all just for show. The bigger potential that all that modern stuff makes available for the picking is lost on Filipinos’ collective short-sightedness and lack of imagination. How then can Filipinos become collectively smarter if they see modern things as mere cosmetic ornamentation? This basic challenge persists.",Others
Inquirer columnist Winnie Monsod MISLEADS her readers into thinking that women make better national leaders,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/inquirer-columnist-winnie-monsod-misleads-her-readers-into-thinking-that-women-make-better-national-leaders/,"I have nothing against women. Hell I love women. Period. I worship at the altar of the woman that is her body and soul. That’s how much I love women. The adage that you can’t beat them, can’t live without them is true; depending on how much bullshit you are willing to accept. To say however that “Women-led countries do better against COVID-19” as Winnie Monsod assets in her Inquirer piece is a dishonest stretch. Indeed, considering she is an “economist” Monsod commits the biggest sin of “data science” — equating correlation with causation…
Summary statistics: The mean (average) number of COVID-19 cases for the period under consideration was 19,064 for the F-led countries and 26,468 for the M-led countries; the mean number of deaths was 1,107 and 2,681, respectively. That’s what the raw figures showed. So on the face of it, the female-led countries experienced fewer cases and fewer deaths.
The backgrounder to this, she writes, is a study conducted — by women, she makes sure to point out — following “the big deal media made over the relative success of seven women leaders–Frederiksen of Denmark, Marin of Finland, Merkel of Germany, Jakobsdóttir of Iceland, Ardern of New Zealand, Solberg of Norway, and Tsai of Taiwan–on their performance (number of deaths per 1,000) in dealing with COVID-19”.
See, just because “statistics” show that “female-led countries experienced fewer cases and fewer deaths” does not necessarily mean female leadership is a cause of better COVID-19 pandemic management outcomes. That fact, of course, does not stop Monsod from issuing her shrill conclusion, that “women leaders have steered their countries more successfully in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.”
As if that were not enough to seriously mislead her readers, Monsod reveals the true agenda of this blurb at the end: “Women like Vice President Leni Robredo and Sen. Leila de Lima, who have shown their worth, have been very badly treated by this government. We, the Filipino people, have to correct this situation. Soonest.” Mareng Winnie, you are predictable, as always.
The idea that Leni Robredo and Leila De Lima are at par with the likes of Angela Merkel is a reach. An overreach, in fact. A friend and I have been discussing what truly ails the Filipino. We’ve come to an agreement that it is basically a socio-cultural dysfunction. Some psychological too. The definition of success is moving over to the other side of the social divide under the general classification of the haves and the have-nots. Women have been stereotyped as the weaker sex. I truly believe this is not true. How many men have been taken down by women? A lot. The casualty count is high.
The Philippines is, contrary to tradition, a matriarchal society. Look at PNoy and Duterte. Both had strong women for their mothers. Yet both are a contrast in character and personality. I have always been for gender equality. I don’t have any qualms about the sexual proclivities of Leila De Lima and Leni Robredo. It becomes an issue because of the standards they have to comply with as public officials. De Lima initially denied her relationship with her driver cum bodyguard. She admitted to it later on on Mareng Winnie’s program. Robredo continues to deny her relationship with Bolet Banal even if it is obvious. This is plain and simple hypocrisy.
Both cannot measure up to Angela Merkel who is one of the longest-reigning German Chancellors. She succeeded Helmut Kohl at a time when Germany faced the difficulty of reunification. She took the mantle of leadership for the European Union in addition to her leading the Germans. She took on the likes of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and other European contemporaries during her term. She has kept her simple lifestyle all throughout.
One of the reasons why we fail as a country is our love for status symbols. We don’t have an efficient mass transport system because a vehicle is a status symbol. The public is enamored with celebrities. This is how Lito Lapid and Bong Revilla landed in the Senate. Millennials haven’t come to the realization that this is a bad practice because they indulge in the same. They cater to the establishment for job opportunities and security. In the process, morality and ethics are thrown out the window. Fake it until you make it replaces the maxim of continuing education and hard work as pathways to success. Post-graduate degrees are sold and bought openly in public educational institutions. Since President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted, we have progressively become a nation of morons. Professionalism is practiced by only a few. The same is true with civility.
Monsod obviously favors De Lima and Robredo because they are in the opposition. If there is any female deserving of Monsod’s accolades, it should be Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. She ousted a popularly-elected President and instituted fiscal and economic reforms which laid the groundwork for growth. She kept her silence throughout the five years she was detained by PNoy. She ousted the sitting Speaker of the House even if she had less than a year left in her term as Congresswoman. She continues to play the role of kingmaker in the political scene.
What is wrong with the country isn’t only about the political structure but also the socio-cultural hierarchy. There is no concept of equality and equanimity. We have no right to know about how De Lima and Robredo conduct themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms but as public officials, there is a minimum standard they should comply with which they are both guilty of violating not only as public officials but as members of the Philippine bar as well.",Others
Continued failure of Philippine Opposition to gain public approval rooted in the hypocrisy of its top “thought leaders”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/continued-failure-of-philippine-opposition-to-gain-public-approval-rooted-in-the-hypocrisy-of-its-top-thought-leaders/,"President Rodrigo Duterte’s niece Nuelle Duterte has, for several years now, been used as an Opposition poster girl by the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media organisations because she reportedly tells people she meets in New York (where she works as a “psychiatrist”) that her famous uncle “kills people”. In a recent Facebook post, Nuelle explores the idea that Filipinos are victims of “operant conditioning” which she describes as “a process of changing behavior by rewarding or punishing a subject each time an action is performed until the subject associates the action with pleasure or distress.” She then goes on to assert…
The [Philippines] is being conditioned to accept that corruption is normal, extrajudicial killing is justified, and criticism is akin to rebellion.
There’s something terribly wrong when people are so easily conditioned. That some even choose it over freedom of thought.
I’m of the impression that Nuelle grew up in Davao before she migrated to the US. I’m not privy to her age but I would assume she was still a child in the late 80s to early 90s when Davao City was akin to no man’s land after sunset. It is easy to say that Filipinos are being “conditioned” by Duterte. But this Duterte hasn’t experienced how Davao City was at its worst. She also wasn’t a resident of the National Capital Region (NCR) during the Aquino administration. Extra-judicial killings (EJKs) did not stop after the ascent of Cory to the Presidency. This was the policy because Fidel Ramos was Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief at the time and, subsequently, Defense Secretary. It is no secret that Ramos followed the dictates of the US when it came to counter-insurgency. He was also the head of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) and the Integrated National Police (INP) thereafter under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. The Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDFs) became Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (CAFGUs) under his watch — paramilitary personnel in every barangay as part of the counter-insurgency strategy.
The other Duterte must also be aware of narco-states of which Mexico is the leading example. Cartel violence has seen civilians in the crossfire. In Colombia, at the height of Pablo Escobar’s power, he held an entire country hostage through his vast wealth through murders of government officials and bombings that killed civilians. He even planted a bomb on an airliner. That Nuelle Duterte has become an Opposition icon because of her surname is typical. What makes it offensive is she isn’t even a Filipino citizen. She is not nuanced in what’s happening in the country in the same manner that other Fil-Ams are. Look at Ruben Carranza, a former PCGG commissioner, who turns out to have held US citizenship at the time he was appointed to a government position.
As @benign0 postulates, our problem as a country is not only political but also socio-cultural. We have “journalist-activists” against the administration but in the payroll of the oligarchs. They are a power bloc unto themselves, they would like to think. This is why they have lost credibility. They are mercenaries. The goal of every impoverished Pinoy is to cross over to the other side of the social divide from have-not to have. We have this photo of Manny “Pac-Man” Pacquiao eating with his hands while, on the side of his plate, one could spy gold-plated or even real gold cutlery. His initials “MP” stands for Mamamayan at Panginoon we are told. He believes or his handlers are making him believe, that this is his pathway to the Presidency. Our politicians pander to the poor in every election cycle because they comprise the most number of voters. The poor are agog at the attention paid them for this short span of time. They are used to the routine of their votes being bought during campaign seasons. Any well-meaning politician will start off as an idealist but will eventually be consumed by the system.
This is why I am amazed at the effrontery of leftist-militant bohemians such as the cabal of Inday Espina Varona. She praises Erik Matti’s latest cinematic masterpiece On the Job: The Missing 8 but doesn’t see herself in the role that John Arcilla plays as the mouthpiece of political kingpin Manong Pedring Eusebio played by Dante Rivero. We have seen journalists being the grantees of edifying scholarships such as the UK’s Chevening and Canada’s McLuhan but they’re none the better once they are back home to continue in the practice of being paid hacks. This practice shows no signs of abatement as even the millennials are following in the footsteps of their seniors. Just look at the Rapplerettes of Maria Ressa. They are the future of Philippine journalism. Scary, right?
While the Aquinos Ninoy, Cory, and Noynoy are resting in peace, Marcos continues to be the bogeyman for the Opposition. Marcos’s flogging is worse than what Mussolini or Qaddafi ever got. Marcos’s memory lives on today because the Opposition would rather make use of the very mind conditioning that the other Duterte speaks of rather than uplifting the level of political maturity of Filipinos. They are no better than the frailes who wanted Filipinos to remain ignorant so they can be manipulated at will. This is what ABS-CBN achieved “in the service of the Filipino people worldwide.” I have gone from an idealist in my youth to a pragmatist as a yuppie as we were then called. The fact is there is no single politician in the country who can claim to be as clean as what the opposition claims the members of their ranks are. This has been the case since time immemorial.
The Yellowidiots have never made good on the promises they made while in the process of ousting Marcos in 1986 and they can’t claim the success for it either because credit to that belongs to Juan Ponce Enrile, Gringo Honasan and the US. I’m no Duterte apologist but I can see what he has been able to achieve in his five years in office despite his having to contend with the shrill Opposition. That is a separate achievement in itself. Think of what he could’ve been done if the Opposition cooperated with him for the sake of nation-building. What we have actually seen is the conditioning being done by the opposition on the Filipino people since 1986.
The infrastructure Marcos built bears mute testimony to his achievements. This is also true in the case of the “defeated” Vice-Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who continues to rank higher than the “winning” Vice-Presidential candidate Leni Robredo in surveys for the 2022 election. Contrast this with the Opposition whose members, after thirty years in power, can only boast of naming whatever in honor of Ninoy Aquino and the monuments to him throughout the country — an unofficial “hero” whose fifteen minutes of fame was had at the tarmac of the airport now named after him. Pathetic.",Others
Why be pink when you can be FILIPINO?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/why-be-pink-when-you-can-be-filipino/,"The rebranding of the Yellowtard cause around the colour pink represents a massive misreading of the pulse and character of the Filipino people. For so long, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans within it rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) expressed bafflement over the continued popularity of incumbent Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Unfortunately for them, that vexation had not translated to curiosity and that curiosity into actionable insight that serves their “cause”.
The fact is, Filipino culture remains a culture of machismo. Ana P. Santos, in her June 2018 piece “The Price of ‘Machismo Populism’ in the Philippines” for The Atlantic, describes “a sexist strain that has long festered just beneath the surface” of “polite” Philippine society that Duterte taps to sustain his popularity. Santos further observes…
Male action stars popularized in Philippines’ cinema and telenovelas who save the day seemingly using nothing more than braggadocio, and noontime variety shows where scantily clad women dance and male hosts flirt with them, glorify machismo and normalize sexist behavior.
Indeed, this makes the Yellowtards’ cozy relationship with Big Corporate Media even more interesting when one considers the hundreds of millions of pesos in profits these media companies have made on the back of low-cost productions that regurgitate action star and kalaswaan tropes that keep Filipino audiences hooked. This does not include the mind-numbing noontime variety shows that made stars of the likes of Vice Ganda, Maine Mendoza, the Tito-Vic-and-Joey trio, and Kris Aquino. Right in the ingrained mediocrity and exploitation culture of Big Media and the symbiotic relationship the Yellowtards maintain with their oligarchs shareholders and the celebrities whose careers they prop up lies the profound hypocrisy of this disente camp.
More important, however, is the curious fact that Yellowtardom’s “thought leaders” and campaign strategists had all but failed to apply the marketing wisdom of their media henchwomen to their own desperate campaign to seize power legally as the 2022 national elections approach.  The pink ribbon that presumptive leader of the Philippines’ “United Opposition” sports nowadays presumably represents the plight of the country’s “victimised” women consistent to the context Santos paints in her Atlantic piece. Indeed, they go as far as suggesting that Filipinos today suffer a form of “battered wife” syndrome. In his Inquirer piece “The will to fight back”, Professor Randy David writes of “why [‘vice president’ Leni Robredo is] running for president and why the nation desperately needs someone like her at this time.”
The metaphor she employs references the complex situation of countless victims of domestic violence. Without saying so explicitly, she likens the Filipino public’s forbearance with Mr. Duterte’s incompetent and violent presidency to the deep ambivalence that women experience when the men they chose to love and raise a family with turned out to be dissolute tyrants. They continue to love their abusers, offer excuses for their repugnant behavior, and hang on to every little sign that they are at heart good persons.
Under this light, it becomes easy to see why the Yellowtard campaign is underpinned by an ill-thought-out strategy that dooms it to failure.
First of all, the Feminist Card at play in the branding of the Opposition bid targets only half of the voting population — women. Second, of that female population, only a minority set  would consist of members who would consider themselves in abusive relationships. The Union of Catholic Asian News reports that only “one in four Filipino women aged 15-49 has experienced physical, emotional or sexual abuse by their partner or husband.” On this back-of-an-envelope reckoning alone, could be gleaned that Robredo’s ill-fated campaign would directly resonate with less than 13 percent (one fourth of the female vote) of qualified Filipino voters. That is a clear set up for failure.
This is the whole trouble with the elitist mindset of Yellowtardom that was forged over years of shrill chatter within their echo chambers and chi chi private-school-along-Katipunan-Road conferences and forums. They have come to regard Philippine society through the yellow- (and now pink-) tinted lens of Western European and coastal North American woke culture where every fluidity, equality, and other nebulous gender-prefixed notion, when shouted out, serve as calls to “activist” action (or prayer).
It really comes down to what pink actually means to the Filipino. Has there ever been anything in Filipino culture that was symbolised by this colour? No? Why pink then? It seems the Yellowtards and the broader Philippine Opposition that they infest are in the midst of an appeal to voters that seeks to espouse anything but what really matters to the ordinary Filipino.",Others
Is “voting wisely” even an option?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/is-voting-wisely-even-an-option/,"The Philippine General Elections for 2022 had already began when the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) welcomed various political candidates from all walks of life as they applied for certain national or local positions. Some were old, some were young, some were familiar, some were unknown, and some were something in between those lines. However, since the Philippines only gets to choose the country’s chief executive once every six years as mentioned by the Constitution, all eyes were on the presidential hopefuls.
Electing a Philippine president would always have its own cultural and historical value that mirrors the peculiarities of our archipelagic nation. Way before smartphones and telecom groups like Samsung, Apple, and Huawei were raking in financial benefits brought by 3G technology, Philippine politics had already been marred by its own version of 3G: Guns, Goons, and Gold. Assassination, intimidation, and bribery were the names of the game when you play politics and vie for public office in the Philippines. To a certain extent, these three demeaning acts are still being done to political opponents, supporters, and voters, but it has continuously evolved as Internet usage permeated the lives of ordinary Filipinos. These technologies might have mitigated such dangers especially to human life, but it can nevertheless be disheartening and intoxicating.
Even though the Information Age transformed how elections and politics are played, it doesn’t change the notion that the Philippine electoral system is bound to degrade with time, where there is premeditated degeneration brought by the frailties and flaws of the 1987 Constitution. Taking a look at how a presidential candidate takes Malacanang Palace in an electoral process, a presidentiable only needs to have a numerical advantage over his or her fellow presidentiables. Basically, the candidate who gets the biggest number wins, whether he or she won it through a majority vote or as a plurality vote. As such, it can be safely said that the most popular candidate would emerge victorious. Looking at the Philippines that is very attached to popularity and creating impressions, we have romanticized elections where these individuals would entertain their supporters and woo possible voters in numerous creative ways, which would include singing, dancing, and displaying acts of charity where political campaigns are becoming like noon-time, variety, Philippine TV shows.
A number of individuals would say that the best way to counter this degeneration of Philippine elections is to “vote wisely”, where a voter would meticulously check a candidate’s background, character, and political platform. Others would say that one can counteract this degeneration by “voting according to one’s conscience”, where practicing the right to suffrage entails discerning what is wrong from what is right. However, let’s be practical here since the ideal is far from what is real. If everyone is going to vote wisely and vote accordingly to one’s conscience, we’d end up compelling ourselves to look for saints in the company of sinners. The conclusion is that, we’ll just keep on chasing pavements over and over again.
To learn how elections ought to be, observing the third and the fourth largest economies of the world might provide us with good insights, specially considering that they are holding or have held their general elections this year. Japan would hold their general elections in a few weeks where the current administration of LDP and Komeito are expected to retain a majority of their seats, while Germany has just recently concluded theirs, where the centrist-left party SPD won the largest number of seats in the Bundestag, followed by the centrist-right party CDU-CSU. These two countries are known liberal democracies, where they elect representatives to the parliament, who in turn help in determining who would be the country’s head of government.
It is interesting to notice that when they hold elections for their respective parliaments for the lower house, there are only two parts where Japanese and German voters practice their right in the ballot. First, they choose who their representative would be in their respective congressional district, and then they choose what political party they are going to cast a vote for, where parliamentary seats are awarded to the political parties in accordance to the percentage of votes they have garnered. These are tallied and, later, these political parties would get to know who gets to form the government.
Both cases show a significant degree of simplicity for the voters, which is in contrast to the Philippine electoral system, where we choose a president, a vice president, 12 senators, a party-list, a governor, a vice governor, a congressional representative, a number of board members, a mayor, a vice mayor, and a number of councilors. Depending on one’s domicile, some positions might be written on the ballot, while others would be absent (for example, Metro Manila voters have no need to elect a governor, a vice governor, and board members). Nevertheless, it is evident that choosing candidates during general elections in the Philippines is both a daunting and a stressful task. I am even unsure if every voter is provided with the best resources in applying these “vote wisely” and “vote according to conscience” notions that a number of individuals are perennially calling for. We cannot hold ourselves and fellowmen accountable as voters when the electoral system itself calls for the complicated game to be played blatantly with underhanded tactics.
If we want to embrace voter accountability, adopting parts of the Japanese and German elections might help. A voter-friendly ballot would allow the voter to look for issues that would serve his or her interests the most, instead of just relying on name recall. A clear example is when the German Green Party gained a significant amount of seats in the Bundestag as more Germans are more conscientious regarding climate change issues. A voter-friendly ballot would also better reflect the conditions and the needs of the electorate. In an instance where one citizen dislikes his/her representative’s performance, the voter might as well choose a different candidate as a sign of protest and discontent. If it is the other way around, this citizen can ought to elect the incumbent as a symbol of support and continuity.
It might sound radical, but I am in favor of greatly simplifying elections in the Philippines. Creating an electoral system where voters would only choose one representative in Congress for the national government and another member of the board or councilor in their respective local government unit would sound extreme, but this would remove numerous social diseases associated with our elections. These congressional representatives would convene and choose who will be the head of the government, while these board members or councilors do the same in their own localities. Of course, there are nitty-gritty parts that need to be addressed, but it doesn’t change the fact that such reformation and restructuring of the system is a must if we are to uplift the lives of marginalized Filipinos. After all, everyone becomes only a number come election time. Election in a democracy is an equalizer, and it is meant to be one.",Others
Corrupted Values on Vote-buying,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/corrupted-values-vote-buying/,"Presidential aspirant Leni Robredo and Bishop Socrates Villegas have gone on record as saying that voters should take vote-buying bribes offered to them despite going on to vote a different candidate later on. The late Jaime Cardinal Sin had also said the same thing before.
I hope that people with a true sense of decency also have the common sense to see the ridiculousness in this.
Supporters of the above-mentioned people will argue, but voters will do that anyway! That’s practical! Why condemn such an act? Let them do it!
But in both true Christian and secular values, that act is dishonest.
First, why take the bribe at all? When you take the bribe, you signify a promise to vote for the candidate. Denying this is a foolish exercise of illogic. And isn’t accepting bribes wrong at all? Perhaps the people above don’t realize that what they’ll do will have an effect of sanitizing all other forms of bribery.
Second, if you take the bribe and vote for someone else anyway, isn’t that lying? So not only do you take bribes, but you lie.
The right answer would be to never take the bribe at all.
I wonder if the politician and church people mentioned here are thinking that any way to give to the poor should be acceptable, even if the means used is sinful by their own standards. Basically, the end justifies the means for them, with the willingness to make compromises to their values. If they do, that would be rightly identified as hypocrisy.
I find it both appalling and amusing that Catholic religious authorities (though I believe there are others who are actually facepalming) are encouraging corrupted values. Either those religious authorities are confused about their own values or, as some articles on this blog and many others have said, are willing to twist their own values in support of their own agenda, which the Catholic Church after all has done in its long history. Or both.

Communists like @TonyoCruz and their fronts like @IBONFoundation push AYUDA nga-nga culture,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/communists-like-tonyocruz-and-their-fronts-like-ibonfoundation-push-ayuda-nga-nga-culture/,"Where is the substance in the drivel Ka Tonyo Cruz writes? Numbers he cited in his Manila Bulletin piece “P10,000 aid for all is needed — and possible” comes from none other than his comrade IBON Foundation Executive Director Sonny Africa. That biased “source” makes everything he writes suspect from the very beginning. Predictably he writes…
Only in the Philippines is there a pushback against aid. Not a few have claimed we don’t deserve aid, especially the poor who are routinely blamed for being poor. Some of those who are vehemently opposed to aid are the persons who show a certain level of entitlement that can only be satisfied by the continued work of the poor and the lower middle class:  Having food delivered to them whenever they please; have public markets, groceries, gas stations, banks, and other essential services kept open; a steady food supply; and medical services, of course.
The think-tank Ibon Foundation has taken a look at the facts and figures, and they have calculated that Filipinos deserve to demand and to receive aid.
Tonyo displays a glaring lack of a basic grasp of economics and public finance. The fact is, any revenue shortfall of the government is financed by borrowings; external and internal. The ideal is to have a balanced budget. Government is not a business that’s run for profit. It’s easy for Tonyo to say the monies are there without taking into account the budget deficit, debt service and funding extraordinary contingencies arising from fortuitous events such as the projected COVID-19 Delta variant surge.
Even more laughable, Ka Tonyo deigns to compare the Philippines with the US which is a rich country and has the dollar as fiat currency. Has he looked at the current US budget deficit? The inflationary pressure tax-and-spend is putting on the US economy? Is he even aware of Philippine banks’ real estate exposure? If the economy is locked down again and there’s an increase in the non-performing loans (NPLs) of the banks, where will the government get the funds to prevent them from failing?
Managing an economy is not as simple as Tonyo thinks it to be. This is why he and his comrades are not good for anything beyond agitating and exploiting the poor. The mendicant culture they promote is not an option in the pandemic environment. Every Filipino has to do his part. Tonyo’s attitude is typical of leftist-militants. They have no idea what their ideology is. Is it liberal capitalism with safety nets or is it socialism with even bigger safety nets?
As it is, the poor are already benefiting from free education from primary to tertiary levels. The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte has spent the highest amount on social services compared to previous administrations. It is easy for Tonyo and his cohorts to demand. But where to get to pay for what they want they are silent on. How convenient. How typically traditional opposition.",Others
Lazy thinking and intellectual bankruptcy remain deeply rooted in the Philippines’ public discourse,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/lazy-thinking-and-intellectual-bankruptcy-remain-deeply-rooted-in-the-philippines-public-discourse/,"In the Philippines, dumbed down political discourse can be seen in various forms of media, particularly in the way political issues and candidates are discussed and presented to the public. This can include the use of simplistic language and slogans, the emphasis on personal characteristics and image over policy positions, and the use of sensationalist and emotional language to appeal to audiences.
The cherry-picking of social and economic phenomena and the turning of these into out-of-context “issues” is also a persistent habit amongst the country’s “thought leaders”. When issues are taken out of context, it can lead to misunderstandings and false impressions about the topic at hand. It can also make it more difficult for people to form their own opinions about the issue, as they may not have all the necessary information and are often gaslit by their friends and family to take the position of the clan or tribe. It is evident, though, that partisan players in the national discourse are deliberate in their practice of commenting on said issues making unsound connections and correlations where none exists and then outright spinning false cause-and-effect narratives.
Understanding the bigger picture often requires a lot of mental work, as it involves synthesizing and analyzing a wide range of information and ideas. It can be challenging to make connections and see patterns, but this mental effort can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of a subject. Thus, the only way to respond intelligently to positions taken by one person or another to whatever “issue” happens to be “trending” at the moment is to step back and take stock.
Unfortunately, the Philippines is a nation of lazy thinkers. It’s a huge ask of Filipinos to think things through before reacting or forming opinion about a piece of information they would come across over a given day. As a result, public discourse in the Philippines is characterised by a lack of new ideas or a failure to engage with new information. It is easy to observe that this has led to stagnation or decline in the nation’s collective intellectual abilities. Laziness and impoverished minds impede an entire people’s capacity to think critically and engage with the world in a meaningful way.
Uplifting public discourse is a complex and multifaceted task that will likely require the collaboration of individuals, organizations, and government bodies. It could involve a number of different strategies, depending on the specific context and issues at play including…
(1) Encouraging more informed and nuanced discussions of issues by promoting access to reliable information and diverse perspectives.
(2) Fostering a culture of civil discourse and mutual respect, in which people are willing to listen to and engage with one another’s ideas, even when they disagree.
(3) Holding public figures and institutions accountable for their actions and statements, and calling out instances of misinformation, hate speech, and other forms of harmful rhetoric.
(4) Investing in education, especially media literacy and critical thinking skills, to empower people to engage more meaningfully in public discourse.
The first challenge Filipinos need to step up to on the journey down this path is to be more aware of things in common and less focused on things that are a source of conflict. Collaboration does not come naturally amongst Filipinos because of their society’s weak civic culture and low social trust. However these could be overcome if people of influence and the community’s top opinion shapers lead the way.",Others

How the Manila Air Traffic Control fiasco mirrors Filipino society,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/how-the-manila-air-traffic-control-fiasco-mirrors-filipino-society/,"“Minimum viable product” is a term that’s been used and abused in the Philippines since time immemorial. It’s synonymous to a term more familiar to Filipinos: pwede na yan. Indeed, two Inquirer pieces today, pontificating on the recent Air Traffic Control “crisis” that rocked Manila’s airport, allude to it but stop short of delving into its cultural implications. The Editor came a bit close…
The Philippines should stop looking at the bare minimum requirement as something that is acceptable, whether it is having only one air traffic management system, having only one international-length runway at the airport or, indeed, having just one main international aviation gateway.
The Noted One, the eminent Manuel L. Quezon III, used a more chi chi term, technical debt — i.e., overdue essential capital works that, in the mean time, are filled by stopgap measures. Think potholes. Filling them every now and then works for a while. Meanwhile the “debt” of having to eventually repave the entire road mounts with time. Quezon writes (or, rather liberally quotes);
The fury over this holiday nightmare led to a term being widely discussed and shared: technical debt. Tufekci helped define what it is. “This method,” she tweeted, “of ‘use duct tape and wire to make old software hobble along’ incurs something called ‘technical debt’—the bill will come due, eventually … Company executives keep betting it will be under the next management … It usually pays off for them … The public pays the price.”
Trouble is, the bigger picture both the Editor and The Noted One, in using only recent history framed by their partisan agendas to expound on the topic, miss is that this is a quintessentially Filipino “crisis”. Look further back and right under their pointy noses is that all too-familiar cultural artefact that encapsulates everything these “thought leaders” use fancy terms to describe — the jeepney.
The jeepney is the minimum viable product to end all minimum viable products. The technical debt (the long overdue implementation of modern transport systems) that crushes just about every Philippine government’s efforts to pay off is so immense that it may take several decades to even catch up with the “interest” it incurs. Yet, the way the Philippines’ foremost “thought leaders” wax “analysis” with regard to the latest tech debt default that is this aviation “crisis”, one would think Filipinos’ habit of entering into commitments they are inherently incapable of honouring is something new.
That’s poverty in its true unpopular sense. Flying is a lifestyle every Filipino feels entitled to — even calling it an “essential” activity. Unfortunately, Filipinos lack the cultural character to support this luxury sustainably and, instead, rely on foreign capital, expertise, and technology to prop up the services that support it. Want an example of indigenous resources serving the public? That’s the jeepney. It can support a post World War II Philippines but not a 21st Century one of entitled daddy’s boys who think they are entitled to jet off to Bohol whenever their weekend “starts”.
We look to the 1950s as “the good old days”. Consider that in the good old days, jet travel was not an “essential” to most ordinary Filipinos. If we insist on being dependent on foreign capital to prop up our aspiration to become a First World country, at least implement foreign capital properly. Otherwise, abangan ang susunod na kabanata. ‘Til the next “crisis”, folks!",Others
Modern Culture vs. Traditional culture: Why I choose the former,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/modern-over-traditional-culture/,"In a previous article, I mentioned a 1990s or early 2000s cable TV advertisement which showed people of different cultures later morphing into people in black modern suits. The narrator was saying that diversity and culture are in danger because of modernization by globalization. I’m still looking for this ad, but I also still disagree with its message that losing cultural identity is harmful to society.
If people say that modernity and traditional culture need not be enemies, I agree. Mass media after all likes to highlight rivalries, not only in politics but even science versus religion, science versus art, and other things. However, if it comes down to it, I’ll choose modernity over national or traditional identity.
I’ll clarify an idea before I proceed. I disagree that what brought about the modern culture could be called globalization. It’s more of free market capitalism, where goods, services and ideas can be freely sold or exchanged across borders, cultures and divides; hierarchy or control by any authority is minimal to absent. Globalization actually has a few players monopolizing or regulating international trade, sometimes even trying to manipulate society and culture to their needs. Esteemed webmaster Benign0 actually criticized it.
Back to the ad under discussion, I disagree that modernity has threatened traditional cultures. Instead it brought us more freedom, world prosperity and relative peace (to earlier times). And we still have our cultural identities, actually. Modernity does exert a pressure on culture, but a good one; more on that later.
Let’s look at it from another angle. Youtuber Lindybeige has a video explaining the book Why We Fight by Mike Martin on why people easily join conflict despite common sense telling them that it’s better not to. He says the sense of belonging to a group identity is a major cause, since a person will likely seek the favor of the group he wants to belong to. When the group fights another group, even for a nonsense reason, the person will fight with them just to maintain their favor. That is tribal dynamics as far as I know.
Another point by Martin is that wars led to societies getting bigger, such as smaller states getting absorbed by bigger states through imperialism. As societies get bigger, they tend to get less violent. So the summary that Lindybiege gave was, violence does bring about peace and is the reason for the relative prosperity of today. As he said, there’s loads of humans now. It implies that the tendency for violence because of identity is good. Of course, I disagree with this.
For me, free market capitalism brought about by liberal values, as I mentioned above, is the reason why there are loads of us now (My view of this is informed by Deirdre McCloskey, who uses the term liberalism or liberal values to describe the support for individualism over collectivism, different from the liberalism associated with the left, woke and progressives; it’s more of libertarianism). The tendency for violence is one of the hindrances. I believe Martin took a very narrow, “small picture” look at the factors involving conflict and societal size and simply left out the influence of liberal values. The numbers perhaps may have looked to him like violence and peace had a proportionate correlation in the eras he looked at. But once you look at the bigger picture, a different conclusion emerges.
Traditional cultures form a concept of group identity as a focal point for survival. Since life was much more difficult then, village-level tribes tend to kill or enslave people outside of their identity, as I explained in my eliminationism article. This is also the cause of racism and bigotry as well as a lot of human-made inequality, which are actually means to facilitate survival.
But the village autocrats can also be cruel to their own people. Aside from what I’ve described, there’s ostracism or bullying of a village member who doesn’t “fit in” or is “different” (like a geeky person). Then there’s gossip. There’s the dictatorship of other villagers on who your mate should be or whether or not you should have a haircut. Either you conform or we whip you to conform… or you get kicked out or killed in extreme cases. This is the kind of cruel life that Disney heroines often lament in song.
Then came the age of enlightenment, industrial era, liberal values and free market capitalism. They created an abundance of good and services, not to mention medical advances, that greatly increased survivability and life expectancy. It also led to recognition for human rights and individuality. Being individualistic was no longer seen as a danger to other people as in tribal days. You don’t need to be tied to your tribe anymore to have the right to live.
And so our world became bigger, leading to more peace. Instead of finding common ground in tribal loyalties, we found new common ground in international products, such as fictional properties. For my generation, it was Transformers and GI Joe and other toy properties. Others are popular music, personally 80s music and new wave. Hobbies like scale modeling and video games, among other things, brought together people from across the world. Identity was no longer the focal point of survival, but was for fun, and I think that was better.
The problem with the idea that violence can bring peace is that it can be used to justify wars, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A propagandist for the war could say, oh, look, if bigger societies are more peaceful, then the Russian invasion in order to revive the bigger society called the Soviet Union to existence is justified.
Youtuber Vlad Vexler explained that the Ukraine invasion was motivated by a cultural factor, namely a search for Russian identity. This dynamic of identity assertion is still found in most collective violence today. The terrorist group Islamic State/Daesh sought to create its own political entity through conquest. There were the Rwandan conflict and Yugoslavian breakup. This shows that, if you want conflict to stop, it’s better to encourage dropping identity assertion and sticking to traditional culture, and letting free market capitalism and liberal values bring peace.
I do recognize that even modern culture has its own problems. Actually, it’s because some business players try to create their own tribalism. For example, if you don’t have a certain product, you are not part of the tribe called “in” and there are messages actually shame you for it. You have rivalries such as the Noranian-Vilmanian one, disputes within hobby communities and, not to mention, sports rivalries. Shills are used to create questionable messages to goad consumption; for example, a blogger is hired to write that a person who doesn’t like to travel the world is a racist (in order to spur travel ticket sales, fuel consumption, etc., by giving non-buyers a bad identity). The proliferation of vanity and self-worship also takes advantage of people’s search for identity, namely, if you are not among the “beautiful people,” you do not deserve validation.
Then you have the wokes. Wokes at first seem to be a product of capitalism, but I think they are actually a product of tribalism struggling against capitalism. “We are a tribe of people who are awakened to issues and their causes, and capitalism is the cause, so we want to bring it and you down, you white supremacists.” Sometimes, they even invoke state action to support their tirades against people who disagree with them. Wokes are among the noisiest in saying capitalism is the cause of exploitation and subjugation, while ignoring the fact that the real perpetrators during the age of exploration/exploitation were older kingdoms (states) expanding empires.
Speaking of kingdoms expanding empires, there’s South Africa in my Silverton Siege article. Apartheid was an act of identity assertion by the Dutch. When you look at racism-supporting messages around the world, notice that they have an identity element in them. Apartheid and segregation are attempts to secure the identity from being soiled by the blood of others. Adolf Hitler really believed this when he led the Nazi party, although his conclusion was that the greatest way to preserve identity and purity was to eliminate the impure. And racial purity was not an idea that was unique to him; it was basically everywhere at the time. Darwinism was also used to support it.
I remember the witch character Kim Diehl from the Soul Eater manga and anime. Because her kind was subject to discrimination, she said that money is the only thing that does not discriminate against you. Sounds sad at first, but to me it sounded like it supported capitalism over cultural identity. Judging a person based on whether they worked and are willing to buy your wares is better than rejecting them because of their cultural identity.
But I do not advocate deliberately trying to erase old cultures the way Mao-era China tried to conduct the so-called Great Leap Forward (that is a great cautionary tale to keep returning to). No, state action is not the way here. But what is really happening today is that, as a result of the flow of ideas, liberal values and intellectual properties, cultures will have to adjust and change. If they resist and hold on to their old attitudes, they are more likely to create more problems such as more conflict.
I believe though that multiculturalism and similar efforts failed because states and other entities tried to force acceptance. Whether it was through policy or bombardment with advertisement and other messages, it made people feel forced and threatened. Try not to force things on people and let the free market and liberal values do their job.
Philippine culture, like many others, is also undergoing change but tries to resist by holding on to identity. Indeed, many have commented that tribalism is one of this culture’s greatest faults. We saw it manifested in the latest election. Many fanatics from the bigger political sides tried to fight other sides as efforts to please their own group with the hope of a reward, the dynamic that Lindybeige and Martin explained. On the collective depression of pink fanatics, it can be an identity thing; if everybody else in my group is depressed, then I should be depressed too.
Some people describe those glued to their cellphones these days as zombies. But people who are willing to be violent towards others for the sake of belonging are probably worse zombies.
Perhaps embracing modernity and leaving identity behind will help solve Philippine problems. It’s a “modest proposal” that webmaster Benign0 called, quoting Nick Joaquin, “Murder mentality.” I’m sure others will call me a traitor for this. But I’ll stand fast. If loss of cultural identity might be the price for peace in the world, I’d be willing to pay that.",Others
More Misconceptions borne from a narrow Anti-Marcos Mindset,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/more-misconceptions-anti-marcos/,"I’ll continue debunking myths that I believe are held under the Anti-Marcos mindset. Such myths led Anti-Marcos people to use a black-and-white approach, that the way to keep Bongbong Marcos from being elected is choosing the perceived polar opposite and desperately pushing this figure’s numbers up to the point of using the George Bush “if you are not for us you are against us” approach. “If you are not for Leni, you are on the wrong side of history,” is so elitist that you could probably inflate millions of dirigibles with this hot air. But anyway, on with my explanation.
1. If the Marcoses will be put away, all corruption in the Philippines will end.
I have written on this before, but this needs reiteration. Based on the assumption that the Marcoses are the sole cause of corruption and that corruption never existed before them, all that is needed is to erase the Marcoses and no Filipino will be corrupt anymore. I’m sure some other Anti-Marcoses find this foolish, but I’m also sure such people who believe these old-school superstitious mindsets still exist.
Obviously, corruption has been present even in times the Marcoses were not in power, such as during the American era, post-World War2/before Marcos and, of course, after Marcos. Indeed, post-Marcos corruption led some who went to the 1986 Edsa Revolution to reconsider their view of history, sometimes deeming Edsa a mistake.
I still hold that corruption comes from the grassroots, the most basic levels of Philippine society. Just look at ordinary people: they pilfer things and even kill each other in jealous fits over love interests without any politicians’ influence. If ever ordinary people get into positions of power, they bring their habits from the local situation or their local culture with them. The saying goes, “all politics is local.” Thus, corruption is local, too. Even if Marcos never came to power, another like him can still appear.
There is also the idea that putting the Marcoses away means justice will be served and he will be made an example to others. OK, then. But I doubt that even corrupt people will be scared upon seeing it. This is because it is possible that the example will never apply to them. They can even be part of the efforts to put the Marcoses away. Play the angel at first, then reveal your being the devil when you’re in power. Corrupt people are not always on the same boat; they can be enemies of each other too.
2. If Bongbong Marcos returns to power, martial law will be declared and killings will be ordered.
Well, it is possible but… does he really want to do that? Saying BBM will do it just because his father did is a ridiculous and illogical connection. He knows that it is a dumb thing to do. The people believing this seem to imply that they have mind-reading powers and know what BBM can be thinking. Also, just remember that Congress’ approval is needed for martial law to be declared.
People fear that certain candidates will bring around authoritarianism. What makes you think the others, even those who seem “clean” and “angelic,” will not? Again, it is folly to believe that certain people have a monopoly of the “bad elements” in society.
3. If we get all the money the Marcoses stole, the Philippine will become rich and be out of poverty.
This is the mentality that poverty can be cured by giving lump sums to the poor. No, redistribution never solves poverty. As the case of lottery winners proves, people are great at wasting money and can get even poorer than before they won. Also, even if the money was all recovered, there is no guarantee that it won’t be squandered and lost again (well, some of it was).
Money won’t buy everything we need. All that we need in life has to be reproduced by repeated work. Farmers and livestock raisers have to work continuously to produce that food we eat every day, and we have to work almost every day to buy that food. Filipinos though likely wish to be free of work and have food fly to their mouths. Which will never happen.
Also, BBM said in his earlier interview with Jessica Soho that, though he admits the Marcoses have accounts in Switzerland and such, the numbers were inflated in reports against them and they are not from the Philippines’ coffers. This is what Marcos apologists like Rita Gadi also say. Of course, I do hope to know with finality the truth about this. If the apologists’ side is confirmed, then there’s even less hand-outs to expect.
Money can be lost not only to corruption, but also to incompetence. Even if you remove corruption, honest mistakes and bad decisions even by well-meaning people can still lead to losses. This is why I nowadays strongly oppose strong centralized control wherein you assign people to produce materials without using market dynamics. That is what caused millions to die of starvation in Mao-era China.
4. Trolls are responsible for the resurgence of Marcos popularity.
The Marcos legend had been built over a long time, through stories, opinions and anecdotes passed on through word-of-mouth, offline. The old people will always look at the old days as being better and will associate it with the leader at the time.
Internet trolls likely had little effect on the growth of the Marcos legend. Such efforts depend anyway on what has already been built offline and only serve to affirm what people have already been believing for a long time. Those who are “converts” are likely few.
Even then (1980s) the tall tales were circulating, like that of BBM having actually died and being replaced by a lookalike (probably inspired by Jesus Quevenco, pictured). Saying that tall tales originated only from Internet trolls is wrong. What the picture below depicts has always been the most trusted news source for Filipinos, one that worked even without online communication.
This is why any “door-to-door conversion” attempts will not work.
——————————————
“Converts” to Marcos from the Yellow side were brought about by, as I described above, reconsidering who was on the good and evil sides. Basically, it turned out to be in the reverse for them. They think the Yellows deceived Filipinos and the Marcoses are innocent. Tell them that both sides can be seen as corrupt at the same time, they say no, it can only be black and white. But who parroted “black and white only?” The Yellows. Their messaging (which you can call propaganda) was turned around on them.
I do not go for Marcos myself, the reasons I’m sure everyone knows. But if I were really vehemently anti-Marcos, I would be concerned about the attention being given to Marcos, because it is drawing more people on his side. I would tell them, stop giving him negative publicity as it is still publicity and it is helping him. But, I’m sure the Marcos side would say, don’t interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
I was told that big business backs the Pink side. If true, that is even more reason not to choose that side as I believe they would like to enact policies that inhibit social mobility for poorer Filipinos. Actually, it boggles me, as I believe some of Robredo’s supporters spoke out against big business’ influence in the country before, but now they embrace the opposition candidate when she’s supported by big business.
I also do not subscribe to the logic of getting the next most popular candidate to be a buffer against Marcos. I would rather vote according to the candidate closest to my principles. Robredo fanatics still embrace populist methods. They’re using the same methods as their opponent, thereby using the same thinking that caused the problem.
Then I hear that I will be on the wrong side of history if I don’t vote for her. Even if I vote Abella, Gonzales or Lacson? So be it then. I’m on the wrong side of history for some, but to me, I exercised my freedom and voted for who I want. Not because some misguided consensus dictated on me.",Others
Hidilyn Diaz lifts not just weights. She lifts an entire people.,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/08/hidilyn-diaz-lifts-not-just-weights-she-lifts-an-entire-people/,"After 97 years, the Philippines finally bags an Olympic gold medal thanks to Ms Hidilyn Diaz. Diaz is now a pillar of Pinoy Pride, the cornerstone of an entire national identity. If one could draw this national identity, it would look like an inverted pyramid with a tiny elite of excellent Filipinos at the pointy bottom holding up the massive rest of the pyramid above it.
Indeed, the weights Diaz needed to lift to bring home that gold are nothing compared to that involving her weightlifting feat today. She has the pride of an entire nation on her shoulders. Everyone wants a piece of her — because there isn’t much in the way of anything else that props up Pinoy Pride.
This being an election campaign year makes her role in society particularly tricky. On the aggrieved embittered side of today’s politics are partisan camps in control of the country’s biggest media conglomerates, its most influential private Catholic schools, its state universities, and its most encompassing morality radar stations. As such, while the scramble for a piece of Diaz’s personal brand may be vicious, it has already likely been won thanks to the Opposition’s institutionalised social engineering machine.
The reality of that inverted pyramid that describes the character of Philippine society does not change, however. There is probably only one other individual who can relate with the journey Hidilyn Diaz is only beginning today. That person is Manny Pacquiao. Pacquiao, after all, was once at that same pointy end of the inverted pyramid that Diaz finds herself at today. Pacquiao at the zenith of his boxing career was Pinoy Pride embodied.
Today, Hidilyn Diaz is the new Manny Pacquiao. She lifts an entire people. Her achievement is claimed by an entire nation. In truly excellent societies, the pyramid drawing would look a bit more normal. It would be standing on a broad base of the collective achievement of their peoples with an elite set of achievers at the top representing a happy bonus to all that.
It does not take a structural engineer to appreciate the rock-solid nature of a pyramid standing on its bigger end. In the case of the Philippines, the spectacle of an upside down pyramid teetering upon the formidable shoulders of Hidilyn Diaz seems to be a picture that satisfies the pwede-na-yan sensibilities of most Filipinos. Perhaps, like Manny Pacquiao, Hidilyn Diaz will go on to become a senator someday and maybe even become president, essentially getting proper institutions to help with her job of propping up an entire people. Until then, the world champion weightlifter has the job cut out for her. For now.",Others
What to do now with all those People Power memorial relics and other Yellowtard statues and monuments,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/what-to-do-with-all-those-people-power-memorial-relics-and-other-yellowtard-statues-and-monuments/,"What does one do with all those statues of Ninoy Aquino and Cory Aquino littering the Philippines? What is the plan for all these buildings and spaces appropriated to the commemoration of Yellowtard “heroes” and their “glorious” stories? These are now all but quaint legacies of an era that ended this year — one that saw a single compound feudal clan — the Aquinos and Cojuangcos — utterly dominating the national political narrative and culture with their dishonest mythology. This hijacking of the national narrative was aided and abetted by their allies in the executive suites of Big Corporate Media and the administrations of a cartel of exclusive private Catholic schools. Now that Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is President of the Philippines, it would certainly come across as strange that relics that symbolise the downfall and subsequent decades-long demonisation of his family and his own very person would continue to stand.
Thus the dilemma now comes to the fore. President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his running mate Vice President-elect Sara Duterte command an unprecedented majority mandate — more than 60 percent of the Filipino Vote — and a Philippine Congress dominated by allies and politicians friendly to his camp. With this clear mandate comes the confronting reality that the outcome of these elections also serves as a referendum against the Yellowtard narrative. Filipinos have spoken and their message to the Yellowtards is that their ideology had all been discredited. The awkward thing about all this is the big monuments and other memorials — many of them actually explicitly manifesting the very symbols of what Filipinos voted against in these elections — that dot the Philippine archipelago. They are now an affront not just to the president-elect himself but to the 31 million Filipinos who voted for him and against the Yellowtards.
What is President Bongbong Marcos to do with these Yellowtard relics? The most practical course of action would be no action. Just let them be. Be the bigger person and just allow the Yellowtards to have their historical artefacts. Perhaps the temptation will be strong among his more militant supporters to vandalise these eyesores. Again, it is best that the camp be the bigger people and desist. These relics, after all, stand as constant reminders of what the Yellowtards had squandered. They had lost an entire nation after decades of dominating political myth making. This they did by failing to prove that a “restoration of democracy” and the “freeing” of Filipinos from “authoritarianism” would set them down the path to prosperity and modernity. Rather, the Yellowtards have, instead, mounted an effort to keep Filipinos beholden to a dishonest ideology that focused on victimhood rather than potential and on fixation on the past instead of a more productive open-minded embrace of a future of what could be.
Yellowtard rhetoric had long ago exceeded its use-by date. Over the period that Filipinos lapped up the idea that their efforts to become a modern and prosperous people involved a “fight” with “evil” forces out to thwart this, Yellowtard ideology was there to provide the underlying dogma for this sort of thinking. Reality eventually caught up with them. There was no “fight” because there was no “evil” at work. There was only the challenge of navigating the world order to carve out a niche for Filipinos to make their mark on the world stage. The habitual use of this long-obsolete laban (“fight”) narrative by the Yellowtards was evident in the very campaign their “leader” Leni Robredo mounted in these very elections and even now, in the aftermath of her crushing defeat, what they continue to latch on to — the possibility that this “fight” will persist as a “movement” over the next six years of the Marcos presidency. Even now, the Yellowtards continue to put up bogeymen for their flock to focus their mojos on — “disinformation”, “trolls”, and “historical revisionism”. These are society’s “evils” in the minds of the Yellowtards that both (1) account for their catastrophic electoral failure this year and (2) will continue to be the objects of the battles their “heroes” are expected to “fight”. Old habits die hard, indeed.
It’s time Filipinos move on from a way of thinking where failure is always necessarily someone else’s fault or the result of a “sinister” or “evil” force working against the “good guys” and their “good intentions”. This inability of the Yellowtards to take personal accountability to step up to compete in a democracy — the popularity contest that they had signed up to — and to accept defeat with grace knowing that the winners played the better game is a cultural cancer that had long afflicted Filipinos. In essence, Yellowtardism represents everything that is wrong with Philippine society and it is high time that Philippine society rid itself of this blight. By all accounts this is exactly what Filipinos voted to do in these elections. To prosper in the modern world where opportunities abound in unprecedented quantities requires a real fight, not against imaginary demons put up by dishonest partisans and “activists” but against personal and real challenges and against other people, parties, and communities we share the playing field with. The 2022 elections marks the end of the crybaby culture the Yellowtards have imprisoned Filipino minds with for far too long. With regard to those relics that stand as poignant reminders of this three-decade-long gaslighting campaign, Filipinos should look to them and think, never again.",Others
What the Philippines can learn from the late Shinzo Abe,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/what-the-philippines-can-learn-from-the-late-shinzo-abe/,"The assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the campaign period in Nara Prefecture sent shockwaves all over the world. In broad daylight while publicly expressing his support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), he was shot from behind using a handmade gun. He was rushed to the nearest prefectural hospital but was declared dead roughly five hours after the incident. Japanese mainstream and social media were filled with news regarding the shooting of a former prime minister, stunning the world with gun-related violence in one of the most peaceful countries on the planet. Needless to say, Japan is a country in mourning. Japanese citizens are paying their deepest respects to Japan’s longest serving head of government after the Meiji Restoration.
As the longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, Shinzo Abe’s long political career yields many lessons to learn from. Hailing from a political dynasty that goes back way before Imperial Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, the late prime minister was colloquially labelled as a “thoroughbred”, referring to his political family pedigree. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi was a former prime minister and his father, Shintaro Abe was the foreign affairs minister of then prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980’s. His brand of leadership is an oxymoron, which can be described with contradictory adjectives. With his visits to a Japanese war memorial in Yasukuni Shrine and for formalizing the Quad and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP), he was both a nationalist and a globalist. For actively opening up Japan to trade, labor, and tourism while being prudent in exercising state powers, he can be called as a liberal and as a conservative. Japanese politics expert Tobias Harris has succinctly found the exact word to describe the late prime minister: an iconoclast.
However, his long term in office was not without its fair share of controversies. The highly publicized “Moritomo Gakuen” scandal, which implicated his wife Akie Abe, suddenly caused the drop in then Prime Minister Abe’s approval ratings. Also, the annual ceremony called “Sakura wo Miru Kai” sponsored by the prime minister’s office was flagged for its financial and budgetary irregularities. Finally, the faulty execution of Japan’s early Covid-19 policy, most specially with the “Abenomask”, generally generated negative reactions in the Japanese public. These unresolved national-level issues paired with his worsening gastrointestinal disease eventually led to his resignation. His untimely demise had unfortunately created more questions than answers in modern-day Japanese politics and society.
As the party leader of LDP, the late prime minister was highly supportive of changing or amending the provisions of the 1947 Japanese constitution. This American-backed pacifist constitution established a unitary parliamentary system of government. The most controversial portion of the current Japanese constitution is Article 9, which states that Japan will renounce war as a sovereign right. This was included in the aforementioned constitution, specially with Imperial Japan’s bellicose actions that led to the Second World War. However, geopolitical dynamics of the Pacific are changing drastically and threats to security of the Japanese islands are present. As the only country devastated by two nuclear attacks, having Russia, North Korea, and China at one’s doorstep will make any country feel uneasy. With these imminent threats imposed by these nuclear-armed nation-states, Shinzo Abe advocated for changing this restrictive constitution to address these national insecurities.
Similar with the late prime minister, Filipinos should welcome and take the necessary steps in changing the provisions of the 1987 constitution. Even though the contexts in amending the 1947 Japanese constitution and the 1987 Philippine constitution are completely different, the constitution sets the tone as to what kind of institutions are to be created. This constitution should be amended in accordance to the needs, challenges, and future threats that a country might face. As what US President Thomas Jefferson also advocated, the highest law of the land should be rewritten roughly every two decades. This highlights that constitutions are not meant to last forever in its original form, but must evolve together with the state and society.
Right after his death was publicly confirmed by the prefectural hospital, messages of condolence from various heads of states and governments poured into Japan. Japanese nationals from all walks of life offered flowers, beverages, and prayers to the late prime minister. His official residence in Tokyo, the LDP office near the Japanese Diet, his headquarters as the Representative of Yamaguchi Prefecture’s 4th District, and even the exact location of his assassination in Nara were filled with offerings from ordinary individuals. This explains how Japan respects public office and their officials beyond politics, which is a remarkable reflection of what mature liberal democracies are ought to become.
In a similar manner, all Filipinos must respect public office, whether one is an elected politician, a bureaucrat, or an ordinary Juan dela Cruz. Burning effigies of public figures, throwing of unnecessary insults and tirades, and instigating civil disorder that is being promoted by these activist groups will not create an atmosphere of political accountability. These provocative actions risk escalation that lean towards violence. Filipinos must be politically mature in decision-making, and let their votes serve as society’s true voice as the basis for political mandate. This “live and let live” attitude is a central tenet for any functioning democracy.
Aside from prayers and messages offered to the late head of government, the current Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida quickly denounced Shinzo Abe’s assassination during the campaign trail. This act of terror is an attack on democracy, as what the current prime minister has mentioned in his public speech. He also called for ordinary citizens to practice their right to suffrage and resist such threats to protect and defend the peoples’ freedoms and democracy itself. Eventually, the sitting prime minister’s political party, the LDP was awarded with resounding victory, together with its junior coalition partner Komeito, even though such electoral victory tasted bittersweet in their perspective.
The Philippines too has its own share of experiences regarding election-related violence, where guns are banned and alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited during elections. These realities paired with a long history about guns, goons, and gold associated with Philippine politics created Filipinos who have lost trust not only in the government, but with democracy. Philippine democracy has always been flawed, but it does not necessarily mean that the country must turn towards autocracy, despite these temptations. Genuine democracy demands greater participation of all sectors of the society resulting to plurality and inclusivity, and Filipinos must entrust themselves in creating a democracy that functions well and will serve the interests of the country. An inclusive democracy begins with people who are capable of defending their freedoms and is paired with a system that preserves such.
Beyond Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s demise, Japan will definitely move forward. The Japanese people learn from the past, but they never let their past alone define who they are as a nation. This noble civilization, both blessed and cursed with its geography and its entailing weaknesses and limitations, has made Japan a resilient country. Fortunately, resiliency is something that we Filipinos know the most.",Others
Pinoy Pride Euphoria  Over An Olympic Gold Medal Singular,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/pinoy-pride-euphoria-over-a-gold-medal-singular/,"WALDORF You know, I love French singers.
STATLER I love French fries.
WALDORF French fries? I don’t get that.
STATLER You didn’t order any.

A GOLD MEDAL!!! The world is coming to an end according to my timeline. The Philippines never had one. The irony of celebrating novelty 97 years seems to escape people. If you pay attention to what we write here, our common theme is that pinoy pride often comes at the cost of pinoy brains.
That one gold medal is supposed to erase the goose egg  pinoys  got in London, Australia, China, Greece, Barcelona, Seoul and a ton of other Olympics where we got no medals. While doing some Google searches in preparation I ran across a curious headline that had the words : Philippine Olympics Gold Medal 1988.
Usual pinoy KSP headline. I wonder if Ben Kritz wrote it. They counted a demonstration sport medal as a gold medal. Show me a nation that even mentions their Olympics demonstration sports medal 32 years later  and I will show you a nation that has no success in the actual Olympics.
I did not write this for clicks. Nobody else will point out that in the Philippines, the passion is in the celebration and never in the preparation. Look at the Olympics sports and show me the passion nationwide for those sports in the years where are there are no Olympics. Maybe it is expecting too much for the Philippines to “act like you’ve been there before” because they have never been there before. Nobody asks why it took 97 years. Well no shame in being on par with Bermuda.
I had at least one angry person tell me celebrating the first ever gold medal in 97 years is appropriate behavior. You can look at it that way. The glass is 1% full. Allow me to play devil’s advocate or maybe just remove advocate.  Why do other countries routinely win at least a dozen medals every Olympics and we only got the first one in 97 years? Look at the pinoys going nuts now, all that energy. If they transplanted the energy we see in celebration and pour that into preparation then I am sure we would have gotten to that first gold medal sooner.
The Olympics is a strange place to be planting the pinoy pride flag. The country routinely leaves the Olympics without a medal. They bask in the glory of demonstration medals. If that is not a metric for low standards then I don’t know what is.  The Olympics should be a place for pinoy humility but we know pinoy humility is as nonexistent as pinoy DUI law enforcement. Japan gets 41 medals in a single Olympics ( 12 gold 8 silver 21 bronze) . I don’t choose them because they got the most medals , I chose them because I want to take away the pinoy excuse of genetics.
As I wrote nine  years ago ,   Pinoys  care about the preparation about as much as they care about discipline and following rules.  They will jump on the Olympics bandwagon when the horse is out of the barn. Ask Michael Christian Martinez . Nobody cared about him including the government until he was carrying the flag in the opening ceremonies.
One gold medal in 97 years. WOW!!! You are enjoying it the same way I would enjoy Jollibee if I was stranded in the desert alone and hungry for two days. The Philippines popped their cherry when it comes to an Olympic gold medal. They are also looking at it with the objectivity of a 15 year old when they go through it literally. I guess for some there is glory in popping your cherry at 68 years old.  Celebrate away.
We know the pinoys can celebrate over the most minute of baby steps. They don’t get a steady diet of Olympics medals because like Waldorf and Statler ,  they didn’t order any. You order by being as passionate as your opponents at home before you earn the honor of being passionate on the Olympic stage.  Medals come to the passionate. I only see passion in the Philippines in celebration and a few basketball games.  You know there are some countries that minimize their celebrations because they expend their energy preparing for the Olympics . Like Japan. I guarantee you they are not going nuts over one gold medal.",Others
Infighting within LGBTQ+ community after Sassa Gurl makes 2022 White Castle Whiskey calendar!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/infighting-within-lgbtq-community-after-sassa-gurl-makes-2022-white-castle-whiskey-calendar/,"Wokedom are cheering a recent announcement by Philippine manufacturer of alcoholic beverages Destileria Limtuaco & Co. that popular Tiktok influencer Felix Petate Jr., a.k.a. “Sassa Gurl” will be its calendar model for 2022. The thinking behind the cheering is that another member of the LGBTQ+ community had broken into yet another bastion of that reviled culture of “toxic masculinity”. White Castle Whiskey has long been identified with working class masculine Filipino drinking culture and its calendars are famous for featuring the hottest natural female celebrities of the year in skimpy attire for men to ogle.
That a gay man who made a name for himself doing low-brow comedy on TikTok in drag made a calendar spread that had traditionally been designed to titillate an audience (not make them laugh or attract ridicule) seems to be now regarded as an “achievement” of sorts. Not all in the community see it that way though. Social media personality Miyako Izabel for one begs to differ, pointing out that an act that gained fame by making a mockery of a way of life used as a ticket to break into a space once reserved for physical feminine beauty is a travesty and not a source of community pride.
It seems that the intended outcome as envisioned by LGBTQ+ “activists” is to force themselves into a space for the sake of planting their flag and claiming said space as further ground gained. A “representative” claiming the year’s edition of a men’s calendar being regarded as ground gained misses the point. The real prize ought to have been earning acceptance from that calendar’s traditional audience — heterosexual working-class men. The actual outcome couldn’t be farther from what LGBTQ+ “activists” imagined.
In reality the White Castle Whiskey calendar is expendable ground. One can imagine the average bugoy seeing Sassa Gurl splashed on this calendar and LGBTQ+ “activists” doing victory dances around it and then thinking, sige sa inyo na yan (go and take your trophy and knock yourselves out). There are, after all, other pinup calendars and, of course, the Net where photos of nice looking women can be found. White Castle Whiskey would still be a nice cheap drink to partake of after a day of pasada. Just don’t look at this year’s calendar.
Was Sassa Gurl bagging this year’s White Castle Whiskey calendar a “win” for the LGBTQ+ “cause”. It depends on how you define success. Is it space on a men’s calendar? Or is it earning genuine goodwill from — even respect of — straight working class men? If you make yourself the scorekeeper of your own game, you cannot claim to be truly serious about defining what winning really means.",Others
Why Yellowtards cannot shake the ELITIST label,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/03/why-yellowtards-cannot-shake-the-elitist-label/,"The single biggest crisis the Yellowtard camp are dealing with in the final five weeks of the campaign is the perception that they are elitists. Try as they might, the label sticks like a rash. A virtual who’s who had been pointing out this politically-debilitating character of the Yellowtards for years. Unfortunately, it seems it is only now that their foremost “thought leaders” are taking a second look at important lessons about the character of their community that they should have learnt a long time ago
The trouble with the Yellowtards is that they lack self-awareness. This is likely due to most of their “thought leaders” being products of Philippine society’s gated communities and chi chi Catholic private schools. Within these ultra-exclusive communities are ingrained the sense of entitlement that shines through the Yellowtard collective character today. The vibe is easily picked up by ordinary Filipinos. Unfortunately for most Yellowtard insiders, elitism is like water to a fish. It is ingrained in the very fabric of their sub-culture.
Of the way this mental condition manifests itself in their interaction with people “down the hill”, Adrian Gache, a “fourth year Political Science major at the University of the Philippines Diliman” observes in his Rappler piece “Moral politics and the elitism of the Robredo campaign”…
It is clear that a significant proportion of the Robredo camp is more interested in talking over, or down to, the masses, rather than communicating directly with them. For all we know, Robredo might turn out to be a people’s president after all is said and done. That does not make her campaign a “people’s campaign.” The massive lead that Marcos continues to enjoy over her when it comes to Classes C, D, and E speaks to that, along with the experiences of campaigners on the ground.
He then issues a dire but familiar warning to the Yellowtard campaign…
The “Kakampinks” can continue to turn up in the tens of thousands to Ayala, Ortigas, and other urban centers, drinking their frappuccinos and taking videos on their smartphones all they want. None of that changes the fact that, as long as elements of the Robredo campaign remain distinctly elitist, they will likely cost her the election.
How then can the Yellowtards institute much needed core reforms to their campaign that could possibly still translate to that much-prayed-for miracle over the next 40 days? That’s a tough question considering there is not much in the character or professional profile of Robredo that even a highly seasoned public relations consultant could work with. Robredo simply comes across as too inauthentic to fashion into a people’s crusader. She is also surrounded by shiny happy people who are too closely associated with the elite set — members of the Katipunan Road university crowd, their nuns and the fancy European orders they are members of, those priests who look like they no longer honour their vows of poverty, and, a bevy of social media influencers who tweet and instagram their beach frolics and cocktail breaks in between contributing content to the “KakamPink” cause.
Finally there is all the noise the Yellowtards pump into the Philippines’ political chatter that, quite simply, are irrelevant to most ordinary Filipinos — woke noise like “human rights”, “gender equality”, and “press freedom”. All of these are actually well and truly ingrained in Philippine society. Nonetheless the Yellowtards turned them into campaign fodder just the same. Indeed, the colour pink itself supposedly symbolises this focus on woke issues that are seen to be “concerns” of people who have enough time and money on their hands to trump up such non-essentials as these.
Can the Yellowtards still shake their elitist character and come across as authentic stakeholders in the well-being of ordinary Filipinos? That will be hard for people who routinely retreat into their fortified gated enclaves and summon Consuelo the family cook to whip up their favourite pochero dish for dinner after a day of “house to house” campaigns and selfie-taking at Pook Ricarte. Good luck na lang, right?",Others
Jillian Robredo’s encounter with an Igorot (reportedly) in Baguio City is a cautionary tale on elitist politics,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/jillian-robredos-encounter-with-an-igorot-reportedly-in-baguio-city-is-a-cautionary-tale-on-elitist-politics/,"The words “let me educate you” may not have explicitly been uttered by “vice presidential” daughter (and confirmed woman) Jillian Robredo. However they may as well have. Robredo can be seen strutting around the Baguio City Market surrounded by an enormous entourage the members of which snapped photos at every opportunity as she stopped and stooped to shake hands with whoever gave her a second look. The spectacle had elitist written all over it and it is an exhibit of a lesson the Yellowtard camp led by Robredo’s mother have yet to learn with just a couple of weeks left in the campaign.
Small surprise then that a local, reportedly an Igorot woman, heckled her. Word on the street is that she scolded Robredo and her entourage for blocking the way in the crowded market. Interestingly, the Philippines’ Big Corporate Media community which would normally jump at every story surrounding the Yellowtard campaign only had this to “report” more than 12 hours after the incident…
‘FOCUS TAYO’
After a heckling incident in Baguio City, Jillian Robredo, the youngest daughter of presidential bet VP Leni Robredo, remained focused and will continue doing house-to-house campaigning for her mother.
“Love you, bunso,” Dr. Tricia Robredo replied in her tweet.
The embattled Yellowtard campaign of leading Opposition candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo had been largely unsuccessful at shedding its elitist skin over months of the campaign period of these elections. This most recent incident is yet another setback to their “cause”. A statement had since been reportedly issued by the Benguet chapter of the Robredo People’s Council.
What does Leni Robredo have to do to fix what is clearly a liability to her campaign efforts? Perhaps they could start with reevaluating the role the three daughters, Tricia, Aika, and Jillian play in this ill-fated endeavour. The sisters aren’t exactly paragons of populist appeal as they personally embody the very elitism that sticks to their mother’s campaign like a rash.",Others
Movie Reaction: Silverton Siege,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/movie-reaction-silverton-siege/,"I watched Silverton Siege along with my sister’s partner on our dining area TV while they were waiting to get home one night. The movie was an interesting embellished telling of the 1980 incident in Silverton, Pretoria, South Africa, that is credited to have started the movement to have anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela Freed from prison. It seemed something interesting enough to comment on.
(SPOILER ALERT)
In the movie, a group of saboteurs under the uMkhonto we Sizwe or MK group take cover in a bank following a botched sabotage operation and hold the people hostage as a Plan B. While police try to figure out how to defuse the situation, drama occurs between the hostage takers and hostages. One of the hostage takers later thinks of demanding the release of Nelson Mandela as an ad hoc bargaining ploy. They later decide to release the hostages and mount a dramatic last stand against police storming the bank.
In terms of actors, the biggest name is Mummy antagonist Arnold Vosloo as the level-headed police officer who deals with the situation the best way he can, but is later overstepped by a racist but incompetent brigadier.
In the true story, three male MK members held hostage the bank branch as part of their original plan, not a plan B. The MK group was founded by Mandela himself, so calling for his release was really their job. The hostage drama ended when the police mounted an assault with the hostages still inside, leading to one casualty among the hostages, but the three MK members are killed.
Among the liberties taken by the movie makers is obviously the drama in the bank. The demands for and provision of a helicopter are probably fictitious. The conflict with and death of the pilot later on was probably added to provide some internal conflict for the protagonists.
Also, one of the hostage-taking MK members is made a token female.
In addition, the selling out of the MK members by one of their own, leading to an internal conflict near the end, is also likely a fictitious detail.
Some characters were added to put some emphasis on racism talk. Aside from the helicopter pilot previously mentioned, one hostage is a Black American boxing promoter named Cornelius Washington (there’s a football coach with that name I think), who apparently wasn’t really there if he did exist. Another is this obviously out-of-place whitewashed black woman, probably inserted to demonstrate how oppression could lead to a person trying to blend in with the superior side. I find her more comical than believable.
The lone casualty among the hostages in the movie is the bank manager who turns out to be the daughter of a high-ranking government official in South Africa. She was shot by mistake by a sniper during a negotiation, but that incident is also likely fictitious, along with the bank manager being a government official’s child.
In the early part of the movie, an initial attempt by police to storm the bank is foiled when their shadows are seen through windows in the upper part of the bank. I think the South African police were actually not that incompetent in real life and so it is another fictitious detail.
The last part of the movie, where the remaining saboteurs let the hostages go and hold a last stand, is yet another altered detail.
So we have another conflict between real life and reel life in a movie rendition. But I’m also concerned about the movie’s message. Did the director do all the embellishments to just spice up an incident which is boringly simpler in real life or is he trying to get sympathy for hostage takers?
Paul Chato on Youtube said that movie makers are often on the left side of politics, so if that is the slant of Silverton Siege, it will not be surprising. However, in the movie, an interesting question flies around: what is the price of freedom? The hostage taker says, everything. The racist male bank employee says, it is too much. I tend to agree with the latter.
What really ended apartheid? This, use of force to bring up a point? I’d say this hostage drama did not really contribute to ending apartheid, but stiffened defense against it. If you keep taking hostages or commit terrorist acts, the more we won’t give, say most governments. Case in point, despite all the terrorism that some Palestinians have been carrying out, it has not led to Palestinians having a state or even obtaining improved living conditions.
I would say apartheid was ended by changing attitudes of the times, leading to changes in the attitudes of the Dutch leadership in the later part. Ultimately, they are the policy-makers, so they decide whether to lift their policy or not. For sure some of the white people in South Africa at the time already agreed that apartheid was wrong, so the bank manager having sympathy for the black people under apartheid is realistic (note that important anti-apartheid figure Arthur Goldreich was white). Sentiment from the rest of the world about racism was getting through to South Africans anyway, and I’ll attribute that to the free market of ideas.
If I were to answer what the price of freedom is, it is culture change, sometimes throwing out beliefs and ideas that people cherish. Racism is a product of tribal or national beliefs which the Dutch brought in during the 1600s when they first colonized Africa. These beliefs tell people to hold others under subjugation to keep order or else society would break down. Or it could even be about identity, since identity is a big thing in many societies and racism is borne out of it. And so, another price of freedom could be the giving up of identity (which I’ll discuss in another article). Today, it’s been reported that racist attitudes still remain in South Africa years after the end of apartheid, since some people do stubbornly hold on to their culture and identity.
I hope people take Silverton Siege as more of a cautionary tale and not as a “good example” of how social change is done.",Others
Inday Sara’s Cosplay and Snub By BBM,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/07/inday-saras-cosplay-and-snub-by-bbm/,"Days after President Bongbong Marcos’ second State of the Nation Address, I still find myself gagging over the en faire tout un fromage over our political elite’s so-called red carpet pageantry.
I don’t recall when traditional news media started featuring the fashion statements of this country’s politicians, but it should stop because it detracts from what in most instances is a non-event for the most part — as it should be.
The yearly SONA is after all, just a report of what was accomplished by the country’s leaders in the previous year and what it intends to achieve in the year ahead. It is merely ceremonial and, let’s face it, what a third world country’s leadership says really has little or no effect on the rest of the world.
It is a checkbox long list of checkboxes that must be ticked off by the President.
So, adding a “red carpet gala” to this already tedium doesn’t improve it at all and has the effect of drowning a chewy steak with barbecue sauce. It just accentuates its banality even more and haunts you with an acrid lingering taste.
The bangaw on top of this bureaucratic affair in the nation’s House of Representatives is the appearance of Vice President Inday Sara Zimmerman Duterte Carpio in a moro costume. Her NPC (non playable character) followers are all agog about how much better it is from former Vice President Leni Robredo’s samurai costume.
If it did anything at all for her, the moro cosplay only displayed her banality and accentuated her dumpling-esque shape.
But it’s really no wonder that she displays this craving for attention and I do pity her for having suffered neglect as well as abandonment from her father during her childhood years. It’s just so sad to see her “daddy issues” having to play out using the country’s money.
I also feel both pity and sense of relief for President Bongbong Marcos. I pity him for having to put up with Inday Sara, as it was necessary for him to create a political alliance with her and now that such an alliance has already achieved its purpose, he must distance himself from her unless she drags him down when much still has to be done for his nation.
The so-called snubbing of Sara is indicative of the state of her plummeting political capital. It was unfortunate that her NPC publicity people had to accentuate it even more with photos of her arm in arm with House Speaker Martin Romualdez.
Watching her going through this rigmarole of pretending to still be in the good graces of those who footed the bill of her rise from provincial despot to the vice presidency has all the charms of a dog eating its own vomit.
To be honest, I understand Bonget more than Inday and because of this, it is natural for me to sympathize with him. Unlike Sara who has an innate insecurity because of poor parental upbringing and being a Mindanawon who feels compelled to show superiority to the Manileño, Bonget has never used public events to call attention to himself or salve some childhood trauma. He represents his early education well.
Peace be upon you!

Hospitality and Hospital Industries: Pillars of Philippine Economic Growth,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/05/hospitality-and-hospital-industries-pillars-of-philippine-economic-growth/,"Entertaining tourists and guests, and making them feel welcome and at-home make up a crucial pillar of the Philippine economy. Our national-pastime-turned-industry of singing, dancing, cracking jokes, and playing basketball provides our valued international and local visitors a good time to sit back and relax over San Miguel light and chicharon bulaklak pulutan while the locals sweat or belt it out to provide high-value entertainment.
The rapidly growing population comes with the extra baggage of graying folks retiring from productive work to become key beneficiaries of another huge pillar of the economy: health care and medical services. Hospital facilities are growing, with demand outpacing the supply of beds, instruments, and medical staff.
The Filipino diet fueled by the mall-based eat-out culture and the local congested eye-sore-filled environment are by-design configured to ensure you will eventually get sick and end up availing of imported big-pharma medication to salvage the remaining healthy cells in your slowly degrading body. The national beverage is Coke, which is basically liquified concentrated sugar with carbonation strong enough to melt away toilet stains. Sugar mixed with every form of oil, fat and lard is a nationally ingested poison (a type of legal drug) just about everyone is addicted to.
Media and TV are all about grabbing the biggest audience to entertain. Slapstick comedy shows are a magnet to viewers. Contests in singing, dancing, and showcasing beauty (rather than brains) make up a significant chunk of airtime. Hotels and resorts are in revival mode competing for tourists that have started to return after the pandemic. Airports and airlines expand to the ever-growing influx of visitors that have harkened to the call of our national “It’s more fun!” tagline.
All other components of the economy and society are geared towards supporting these two pillars: hospitality and hospital industries. For example, you need transportation to get to your entertainment gathering or event; you also need good mobile connections to call for help to bring an ailing neighbor to the nearest hospital. Students toil through years of rote memorization training to become care givers, nurses and doctors. Law students struggle to pass the board exam (some requiring 3 takes) with grand ambitions to eventually become a lawmaker who can pass laws that ensure the government collects enough taxes to fund the entire hospitality and hospital circus.
Highly skilled engineers, inventors and scientists are booted out as OFWs. After taking on the call of the pied piper to jump ship, these “modern-day heroes” send huge chunks of money to the big financial sinkhole called P.I. (often confused for a common expletive in the vernacular), as relatives and friends “patiently” expect (if not demand) the next remittance to arrive in time to keep the two pillar industries humming. Your uncle is in ICU after a heart attack; P200K needed for operation; please send money ASAP. Your obese sister needs regular dialysis and insulin shots; please commit to sending P20K a month right after each payday. Your father just got this eureka idea of opening a new Karaoke bar near the tourist belt; please send ALL your savings for initial capital ASAP.
There is no end in sight as to the opportunities Filipinos back home can think of to find ways to use your hard-earned OFW money for you, simply because you are either too dumb to spend it wisely on your own or because your plans for yourself pale in comparison to the greater priority needs of your unlucky kababayans still stuck in quicksand.
Beware: If you don’t plan to use your money, others will use it for you. – Zaxx
Parking money in a bank account (principle of saving for a rainy day) is not really encouraged for Filipinos – otherwise, someone will take notice of your growing heap of sitting cash and you will end up helplessly at the mercy of freeloaders and even being viewed as outright evil should you dare deny a loved one or friend in their moment of pressing need.
Abundantly blessed to high heavens with roughly 20 typhoons a year, the archipelago is a perfect storm for every type of calamity (flooding, landslides, volcanos, earthquakes, pollution – you name it) to ensure maximum probability that you end up requiring emergency medical services and thus contributing to the hospital industry’s cashflow.
Fireworks, guns, rebellions, terror attacks, dilapidated jeepneys, poorly maintained buses and ferry boats all work together to make it more fun in the health-hazard capital of Asia. One definition of fun is adventure, and what better way to have an adventure than to NOT KNOW how the next misfortune will hit you?
A visit to the Philippines is a test of faith that will get you closer to God in fervent prayers of desperation, or simply crossing your fingers (while you find your right leg vibrating involuntarily) till you make it out hopefully in one piece.
The new Bongbong Marcos administration is faced with the challenge of ensuring economic growth, the promise of every would-be heir to the throne. As a mass-importing consumer-driven economy (in contrast to a technology and manufacturing powerhouse) the new leaders of government should acknowledge what is important over what are low-priority distractions. Identifying these two major industries of hospitality and hospitals and knowing how everything else revolves around them as secondary elements of our unique ecosystem can turn the Philippine economy towards that grand unification-theory-based future every president would aspire for the people: an entertaining and comfortable place to live and eventually die in.
And by the way, if anyone wants a new business idea – there’s a good never-ending demand for coffins, necrological services and memorial lots propelled by the hospital industry’s key output: corpses (a.k.a. heroes – for fueling the political ambitions of the next line of Cory/Leni wannabees).",Others
Another critique of Marxism and Wokeness: Hegel’s Dialectic and other Philosophical roots,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/marxism-hegel-dialectic/,,Others
"Philippine politicians and oligarchs are all crass — whether they be a Marcos, an Aquino, or a Duterte or any one of their minions",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/09/philippine-politicians-and-oligarchs-are-all-crass-whether-they-be-a-marcos-an-aquino-or-a-duterte-or-any-one-of-their-minions/,"The only bunch of people who are really confused about where their place is in the Philippines’ political landscape are — you guessed it — the Yellowtards. These people are the country’s political parasites. They deliberately do not commit to a stable ideological framework because they need to maintain a high degree of fluidity in their principles to allow them to easily slither into whatever political bloc of the time offers them the highest ground in the next election.
Consider how these crooks have positioned themselves today. From being rabid Martial Law Crybabies in the campaign leadup to (and even over the decades before) the 2022 national elections that saw the ascent to power of Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr., the Yellowtards have suddenly gone silent on their tiresome but nonetheless renowned Marcos-is-Evil rhetoric. Indeed, you’d think this would be a long-overdue sensible posture when one considers that the Yellowtard powers-that-be share a lot more basic values with the garden-variety Filipino oligarchs that hold court in the current Marcos government today than with those surrounding the Duterte clan of Mindanao (led by former President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter, current Vice President Sara Duterte). After all, many Yellowtard oligarchs are related both by blood and by marriage to many Marcos cronies and are members of the same chi chi Manila golf and country clubs. Imperial Manila, in short.
Imperial Manila people, after all, fancy themselves as members of the urbane elite cream of society that are antitheses to the Philippines’ deep south probinsyano sub-culture. To be fair, the Dutertes do conduct themselves in ways consistent to that stereotype looking back at the character of the former president’s administration and as made evident more recently in the shrill behaviour the Vice President exhibited under the spotlight in those congressional “inquiries” into her budget.
The interesting thing is that when one steps back far enough from all that and regards Philippine society from an outsider’s perspective, all of these characters come across as the same monolithic picture of crassness. Much as the promdi archetype of the Philippine south attracts the derision of Manila’s sosyal set, there is something to be said about the equally tacky way the Marcoses celebrate their birthdays with an astoundingly tone-deaf grandiosity. That’s not to even mentioning the infantile way First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos herself struts around. At the end of the day, they are all the same, whether we are talking about a Marcos, an Aquino, a Robredo, or a Duterte.
The easy way to sum up this general crassness of Philippine society (which characterises even its most chi chi elite subset) is in how the Philippine entertainment industry portrays them. We did write some time ago about the amusing reality that Filipino actors do not know how to portray rich people because “Filipino script writers are incapable of grasping the nuances of what it means to be a true member of the alta ciudad (high society). To top that with another layer of dysfunction, Filipino actors and actresses are woefully ill-equipped to play such characters.”
Shouting matches, loud monologues, and slapstick chatter pepper stories about “love” between characters from opposite sides of the tracks, one-dimensional infidelity, and infantile youth angst. In short, the cinematic devices haven’t evolved much since Lavinia Arguelles played by the late Cherie Gil issued the words “You’re nothing, but a second-rate trying hard copycat!” to Dorina Pineda played by Sharon Cuneta in the 1985 film Bituing Walang Ningning.
Seems we were being too kind at the time. There is no true alta ciudad in the Philippines because all elite Filipinos really have is money and none of what makes one a truly well-bred member of elite society that exhibits grace as a matter of routine habit. This means Philippine entertainment creatives actually had nothing much to work with to begin with. Indeed, if even the most chi chi of Philippine learning institutions, the Ateneo de Manila, which counts amongst its illustrious products no less than the First Lady, fugitive former Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman Andy Bautista, and default Yellowtard leader Leni Robredo fails to instil that breeding and grace, what hope is there for all the sub A-Listers out there? Then again, breeding and grace are supposedly things one would have learnt in kindergarten, right? That leaves much to be desired in that much-vaunted “strict” Filipino parenting style.
Circling back to the original point, one could forgive the Yellowtards’ confused state. The only real way to escape the dysfunction of Philippine society is to remove one’s self from it. Unfortunately for the Yellowtards, like all the rest of them, their top “thought leaders” routinely fail to think outside of the little square that frames Filipino thinking. The worst outcome of this smallness of thinking that afflicts even the “best and brightest” products of the Philippines education system is in how much of what characterises the Philippine Political “Debate” still hasn’t changed.",Others
Filipino movie and TV actors don’t know how to play rich people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/filipino-movie-and-tv-actors-dont-know-how-to-play-rich-people/,"Many people have been wondering why Filipino films and television shows are such massive cringes. On the surface, the most obvious observation is that the emotional hooks used by the template plots of these products are overused and obsolete. Shouting matches, loud monologues, and slapstick chatter pepper stories about “love” between characters from opposite sides of the tracks, one-dimensional infidelity, and infantile youth angst. In short, the cinematic devices haven’t evolved much since Lavinia Arguelles played by the late Cherie Gil issued the words “You’re nothing, but a second-rate trying hard copycat!” to Dorina Pineda played by Sharon Cuneta in the 1985 film Bituing Walang Ningning.
Unfortunately the root causes that contribute to the mediocre quality of Philippine cinema and TV run deeper. Filipino script writers are incapable of grasping the nuances of what it means to be a true member of the alta ciudad (high society). To top that with another layer of dysfunction, Filipino actors and actresses are woefully ill-equipped to play such characters. Back in 2018, Get Real Post contributor Kate Natividad wrote a damning piece about that year’s ABS-CBN Ball that captures the kernel of the bankrupt cultural faculties of Philippine showbiz that likely accounts for this creative deficit…
But the Filipino elite — the real ones — are nothing like the poor copies on exhibit in this Ball. To be fair, the untrained eye would be hard-pressed to find fault in the dresses of the girls. But, man, the boys. Their outfits were screaming f…. (sorry, we’re no longer allowed to used that word).
Natividad goes on to eviscerate any semblance of what’s left of a talent-poor industry’s pitch to much needed fresh blood…
Tasteful fashion is hard to get. Trying hard to get it makes it even harder. Perhaps the first step is to try to make working in showbiz a bit more of a viable career path for the supposed “best and brightest” of the private school set. Otherwise, all you’ll get are designers of stories and looks who know nothing about the “rich” characters they populate their dramas and romcoms with. That’s a tall order as well considering Pinoy showbiz has still to shake off the baduy stigma it suffers…
The sad fact is that people who write and perform for the Philippines’ mass entertainment businesses come from those baduy classes. As such, they craft the characters of their stories, direct their “talent”, and perform the parts using the underclass perspective they bring to the industry. The products are predictable: rich kids dressed in label-screaming outfits acting like assholes shouting at their servants in trying-hard English and poor folk doing the old batang yagit act to tug heartstrings. Really edgy stuff, right?
This is a huge gap considering that class war is the default thematic frame of most of Philippine mass entertainment products.
When will Philippine cinema and TV level up in a region of players already starting to give Hollywood a run for its money? It begins when a bit more reality and a bit less unimaginative melodrama and stereotypes are applied to the local craft. The world is an interesting place and, as such, offers no excuse to creators who suffer a deficit of imagination and a lack of focus on quality.",Others
Why Filipino priests are no longer the toasts of Philippine society,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/why-filipino-priests-are-no-longer-the-toasts-of-philippine-society/,"There was a time in the Philippines when priests were regarded as trophy guests in parties and family reunions. They’d also be essential members of every consequential gentleman’s or lady’s social network. Indeed, in social situations, they were figures that people would mill around to get their dose of basbas (sort of a stamp of approval that supposedly would improve their chances of being welcomed to heaven after death or come across some swerte (good luck) in life), chit chat about coming church events and fiestas, and small talk about the right “Christian” choices during elections.
The song “If I Were a Rich Man” sang by Tevye the Dairyman (played by the late Israeli actor Chaim Topol) in the film Fiddler on the Roof captures the essence of the bygone place men-in-robes held in society and the way they were regarded by people of consequence in the old days.
The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them like a Solomon the Wise
“If you please, Reb Tevye…”
“Pardon me, Reb Tevye…”
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi’s eyes!
And it won’t make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong
When you’re rich, they think you really know!
If I were rich, I’d have the time that I lack to sit in the synagogue and pray
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall
And I’d discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day
And that would be the sweetest thing of all
Note too that captured in the first half of the above snippet of the lyrics of the song is also how the rich were regarded (or so too today in Philippine society) back then and how these rich folk, in turn, would enjoy the privilege accorded by their wealth to sit themselves in good graces with the clergy.
All sound familiar? Of course it does. This turn-of-the-century setting of the classic song describes 21st Century Philippine society!
To be fair, there are a lot of good priests and I am even friends with many of them. The trouble comes from a small clique of bad apples that give the entire priesthood a bad name. These are people who use the pulpit to spew their political partisanism to their captive audience during the homily sections of Sunday masses and lace their “religious teachings” and moralising with a lethal payload of political content and woke rhetoric.
Many Filipinos are intelligent enough to see priests for what they are through contemporary eyes — just another cohort of people with ideas that compete for air time and attention in the free market of ideas. After all, modern thinking is essentially critical thinking — i.e., putting ideas — including religious dogma — through the wringer to squeeze the bullshit out of these and subject their remaining essence to well-reasoned scrutiny.
Not surprisingly, many priests who have long enjoyed that lofty place in society where their views  are seen to be immune to challenge and where those who do dare to challenge them are summarily regarded as minions of Satan fight tooth and nail to resist the winds of change. These are priests who see it in their personal interests to keep Filipinos ignorant so that they remain susceptible to the gaslighting that is the modus operandi of their profession that they had for so long been accustomed to.
Times have changed and priests can no longer hide behind the cloth and pretend to be God. It’s time Filipinos regard their priests as just another community of people out to compete for attention and prop up the ascendancy of their ideas. Nothing wrong with that, of course, because all of us do just that. It is really up to the Filipino public to cut down these priests to their actual size — players in what should be a level playing field where all ideas, regardless of who mouths them, are subject to critical evaluation.",Others
"UK Immigration, Lies in History and Wokeness Debunked by Simon Webb",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/07/history-debunked-simon-webb/,,Others
"Accepting “Racism,” Rejecting Racial Prejudice and the Equalitarian Dogma",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/08/racism-equalitarian-dogma/,"The part up to “prejudice” is the title of a chapter in Simon Webb’s book The Equalitarian Dogma. I wrote earlier that Webb convinced me to drop the idea that race is a social construct and accept that it has biological basis. However, it does not mean that it should lead to racial prejudice; believing that race exists while believing in genuine equality and fairness is possible. But, believe it, the anti-racism movement actually throws a wrench in the works of improving race relations.
In the book mentioned, Webb uses the dialectic method to discuss this issue (sort of turning the weapon around on its users, the Marxists). He made racial discrimination the thesis and anti-racism the antithesis. And his synthesis is the title above. But what’s the basis for this? Let’s summarize The Equalitarian Dogma book first.
Racism and Anti-Racism in a Nutshell
Racial discrimination has probably been around since the start of civilization. As for racial discrimination in the modern age, Webb says that it is mainly the product of the Age of Colonization, when many western colonizers enslaved some black African people. But even before this, African tribes and Arabs had been enslaving black Africans for years. The new colonizers only took advantage of this when they arrived. It is a lie to say that white colonizers invented slavery.
When some people questioned the enslavement of black people, slavers first came up with religious reasons to justify it, such as saying non-white people are a subhuman race described in the Bible. However, (surprise surprise) religious authorities rejected this and said that other races (the papal bull mentioned was actually talking about Indians) are quite human and should be given a chance to accept Christ. So out went religious racism.
When the Age of Science started, the slavers turned to scientific racism. Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution came at a convenient time (even though Darwin opposed slavery). They said that biological differences between races exist and some traits render the black race subhuman. Other names of note in this area are Carlton Coon, Charles Kingsley, and Francis Galton. Scientific racism of this time also helped in the development of anti-semitism by Houston Stewart Chamberlain and the Holocaust as perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.
Some would again question slavery, and one line of argument was that racism led to it. Abolition efforts came with the call to drop scientific racism. Among the voices were anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, who said that cultural differences, not racial differences, account for white ascendancy in the world.  But the main message was that we are to be blind to all differences between humans and treat all equally. This was the Equalitarian Dogma. The idea sounds good to many, anyway, even today.
But this came with the attitude that scientific racism has no other purpose than to support discriminatory practices and is to be instantly condemned. Helping this was the controversy of Cyril Burt, who came up with a bogus study on twins to prove that race is biological. When I was searching for scientific studies about race on the Internet, the results often turn up to be similar to Boas’ and Benedict’s thesis, basically saying that biology has no to little bearing on differences between race. However, I suspect that this is all ideologically driven. The tendency seems to be that, if someone even just suggests taking a glance at scientific racism, he is likely to be shut down.
The Synthesis
The book’s synthesis of the racism issue dares to raise again the idea of scientific racism as a valid idea, saying the idea could not just be hammered shut in the coffin. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin would hint to this in his double-speak: he believes that black underachievement is caused by sociological factors; but he also says that children tend to have the same level of intelligence as their parents within the same race and that genes may have influence on intelligence. Webb notes that differences in achievement are still noticed even in recent studies, even when people of different races are put in the same classroom or schools or subjected to the same content. He says that racial prejudice alone may not explain these differences. He also advises that we lift the taboo over discussing race as something real and with biological roots, and continue more studies about it. He mentions the book The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, and the work of Hans Eysenck, David Reich and James Watson.
To support his point, Webb notes some factual racial differences. Some elements of physical development are faster in black people. Black toddlers tend to walk earlier than white ones. Black teens tend to get into puberty earlier than white ones. Black people tend to have a competitive edge in athletics (one of our own contributors noted this too), and this is attributed to higher levels of testosterone. The downside, however, and this is often attributed to higher testosterone as well, is that more black people commit crimes than other races. Puberty happening earlier means earlier tendency to get into premarital sex. As a result, black students show the least academic aptitude among races. Also, black people have a higher tendency to develop schizophrenia and prostate cancer.
At this point, it becomes more of my opinion. How do we apply “accepting racism, rejecting racial prejudice?” First, look again at the Catholic church as mentioned above. It was able to say that humans of any race should be treated with equal dignity without resorting to any ideology. It is a matter of common sense values. Let’s judge people based not on their intelligence or appearance but on how we perceive their character, as Martin Luther King said.
So we notice that black people fall behind in intelligence and other things. Whether genetic or not in origin, there is a problem to solve. But to solve them, we need to look at the differences. Ignorance of differences may cause us to miss the very factors that will help us help them more effectively.
Here are some suggestions. Since black people tend to be more athletic, providing them some particular athletics programs may help. If black teens tend to get into puberty earlier than white ones or tend to more easily give in to violence, they can be given earlier guidance and counseling on the issue. If they are seen lagging behind in academics, specific help can be provided to them. The idea is that you are looking at a person’s needs and providing the specific things needed without seeing these as “special treatment” but as appropriate measures. If they get locked out of programs since other races do better, perhaps some programs could add slots to increase chances (maybe add teachers to deal with it), or refer them to a school with the same programs but they can more easily qualify for. There are many solutions that could be developed.
Back to Webb, he suggests “Hybrid Vigour,” which is crossbreeding. I take it to mean he encourages interracial mating (and marriage). Perhaps this will allow the good genes from one race to cross over with the other one, with the hope of improving the quality of life of the later generation. This is based on Webb’s own research on the history of prehistoric people, where he says that Homo Sapiens, after a failed attempt to migrate out of Africa, mated with Neanderthals and Denisovans. As a result, the second attempt to migrate was more successful, implying that interbreeding improved the intelligence of the later generation. Based on this, Webb also says that all of humanity are mongrels, since interbreeding had already occurred at some point in prehistory.
Problems with Anti-Racism
Webb says the anti-racist side throws a wrench in the works of race relations by using deceit to make it look like they are upholding black rights. I mentioned in my previous article the rewriting of history saying black people invented the light bulb and other things. There is also the claim that a member of the British Royal Family several centuries ago mated with a black person, so using the one-drop rule, the Royal Family should be considered black. Of course, nothing exists to substantiate these. There was also that “Cheddar Man” issue, where the prehistoric fossil of a man found in Somerset was claimed to be that of a black man, but this was all speculation with no scientific evidence to prove it. I also mentioned the 1619 Project, the attempt to rewrite history from the black perspective, which is sure to be filled with fabrications.
Another example of the wrong approach cited by Webb is that of some universities setting admissions quotas. The observation was made that Asians are the most likely to top university admissions and black people, because of their tendency to rate the lowest, tend to get locked out of admissions slots. So the solution was to set quotas; limit the number of Asian students and set a minimum quota of black students. But this is clearly racism, because you are trying to lock out one race in favor of the other.
A driving force behind all these is Critical Race Theory. Introduced as an academic concept, CRT is actually more of an ideological movement. CRT claims that the foundation of modern society is racism by whites. All of western society, from the nuclear family to government, is soiled by white racism, so everything must be uprooted and changed. So there’s no doubt about it: they want to overthrow western society. But they can’t be in the open about it, so CRT purveyors just say that they’re for a “just cause” and use gaslighting and bullying on any perceived opponents. Any attempt to point out that racism does not exist in a certain case will be tagged as white supremacist itself, thereby self-protecting against any dissent. Even when disconnected from its Marxist roots, CRT is full of leaps of logic and will not cure racial prejudice but will further incite it.
I am not saying that there is no more racial discrimination these days. But the Equalitarian Dogma and anti-racism are the wrong approaches. They are questionable ideologies that try to force equality or equal outcomes for all. It’s better to focus on equal opportunity while applying common sensibility to help and pull each other up.
Get Real Philippines has always held that culture is at the heart of many problems in the Philippines. Even Webb acknowledges that culture has a role in the racism issue. I have said that racial discrimination more a product of culture. If you want to remove it, it is best done by looking at the culture that led to it and making changes there. Quoting David Landes’ The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, ‘If we learn anything from the history of economic development it is that culture makes all the difference.’
I wrote on this risky topic not only because I found a lot of truth in Webb’s book, but because it was relevant to current issues. CRT and related things might brew up a storm that will make Covid look tame. This teaches us to be careful of the ideas we encounter. Some ideas seem innocuous, sometimes claiming to be the ultimate force of good, but they are ultimately harmful for society. They take advantage of our lapses in logic: for example, how can you actually help reduce racism if you are trying to dig up the “secret” racism? That actually brings more attention to it and increases the likelihood of conflict.
Also, the mentality behind “accepting racism, rejecting racial prejudice” is not locked in by the ideas of others. If someone gives you an ideology and expects you to follow it to the letter, best resist. I believe we all have the right to take apart the ideas and pick out what we agree and disagree with. Each individual has the right to decide for themselves what they want to believe.",Others
Chot Reyes Represents The Same People Booing Him,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/09/chot-reyes-represents-the-same-people-booing-him/,"Yes Chot Reyes is at the receiving end of a lot of boos . Like I said many times before . Basketball is all we have . So in a way Chot is all we have. He really has no rival. He is an only child. Yes I am very aware of all you jumping on the soccer / football bandwagon . But you are so new to the bandwagon and so bad at those sports locally that we don’t have a mainstay organic coach to vent your frustrations on. We have no non – basketball figure to breathe fire on. Might help if we had a competent coach stick around 5 minutes after the World Cup is over. Whatever feel good Stajic help generate   just merely exposes the Philippines as a stepping stone not a destination.
There is a world of team sports out there that have zero pinoy impact. If the pinoys cared more than simply men’s basketball there will be not enough venom to go around even if they were all as winless as Gilas. Chot though reached the mountain top to be the national coach of the sole significant sport of this country. When you are just a  cook in a one-cook restaurant that only believes in serving one dish then you get all the credit and all the blame.
Pinoys are unique in the sports world because:
1) basketball myopia – whenever I bring this up people somehow bring up billiards as a #2 sport . Proves my point  , if billiards is your #2 sport how athletic can your nation possibly be? It is a game not a sport. Pinoys made it a sport because it gives them the illusion they matter in the world of sports because of Bata-Reyes.
2) there is very little regional relevance in a country of 110 million people. Cebu and Davao are extremely well populated cities. When was the last time a significant number of people tuned in to major sporting events that were hosted there? Wouldn’t high profile sports all over the country benefit and encourage athletics ? Oh I forgot. A lot of people cheered on 18 American born and developed players who had the Philippine flag on their chests. Apparently there is not much talent here  to encourage based on our local soccer federation.
3) there is no concept of seasons . Yes the Philippines has only two seasons :hot and hotter .  Yet just like rotating crops in the same field makes biological sense and is practical. Having some kind of diversity in the local sports landscape might provide some synergy for all sports involved . Silly me, I mentioned sports plural. This is a basketball pa more society.
Who am I kidding ? I know what is on mass media here and there is no hope for the audience of those tv shows to comprehend anything beyond basketball . There is such a low barrier to entry for basketball much like a Daniel Padilla movie, a TV show featuring Vice Ganda or Andrew E hit.  That is your audience. The thing is your audience is where your athletes come from and where your supporters come from. I already told you in my last piece how crowdless local soccer is. So it makes logical sense there is no inspiration for local players to work hard . Hard work is what leads to World Cup berths. Sporting events that are well attended means money. Money helps athletes.
I said before complacency is the problem with the pinoy basketball player with international aspirations. To get attention and funding , basketball was the one way to go. If you excel enough locally to get on the national team , you have no rival. You feel complacent. Yet every country that opens a can of whoop a$$ on the Philippines in basketball has so many other athletes accomplished in other team sports and consistently racks up medals every Olympics. Pinoy basketball players have no domestic rivals and get beat by other countries with more diverse athletes and broader sports choices.
We boo Chot because the locals actually play the sport he is coaching and most of the players on the team grew up like we grew up. Singing Lupang Hinirang and watching some version of Tito, Vic and Joey on noontime television. Basketball is all we know so we feel entitled to some relevance in that sport. Basketball is the only international championship that we regularly watch every year.
If Chot is considered stubborn and close minded, aren’t Filipinos closed minded in terms of where they focus themselves athletically and even creatively? All you have on TV are a very narrow range of locally produced TV shows and sports. Yet the elected officials want to ban Korean shows and claim a monopoly on “pogi“. Watch local over the air news and listen to the intonation. Are they addressing a literate audience? Vice Ganda ‘s popularity and longevity in this country speaks more about us than it does about him.
There are certain customer relations trainers in the corporate world who tell their employees that complaints are good. Let me repeat that , complaints are good. Commplaints or negative feedback may make us bristle instinctively. Complaints are the negative feedback we need to change course in our direction in the words of Tom Hopkins. Negative feedback like booing is a much more pleasant sound than what I heard in this game from Kaya FC-Iloilo vs. United City FC . I did not hear a crowd and I did not see a crowd. Boos are preferable to apathy. The point of my last piece was that pinoys are apathetic about football. Yet that cosmic leap that pinoys have too easily accepted . They do not play football well, they do not support football well but will gladly accept the World Cup appearance and the solitary goal they scored.
Pinoys it seems can’t stand Chot but they do nothing to change their culture. The basketball pa more mentality only takes them so far every single time. They are so blind to other sports that they cheer on women who have little in common with them and just salivate at getting more naturalized citizens on Gilas. They love basketball only and it is so painfully obvious that basketball loves other countries more. I doubt it is a coincidence that those other countries that make mincemeat playing Gilas love other sports more than basketball. Complacency and tunnel vision are the values that dominate pinoy team sports culture. That will not change anytime soon. Neither will their fortunes.",Others
The problem with De-stigmatizing and Forced Acceptance Efforts,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/de-stigmatizing-efforts/,"The reaction of opponents against the decision then of President Duterte to move tambays (derived from “stand-bys” or loitering freeloaders) off the streets included attempts to de-stigmatize tambays. They say things like “not all tambays are crooks” or “being tambay is not wrong.” But these are not really true because increased number of tambays has been associated with higher crime rates, and it is still related to the freeloading problem of society. And… tambaying is still prohibited since Republic Act 10158 still penalizes loitering.
I know that de-stigmatizing is an attempt to stop hatred of others and to prevent violence against them. But de-stigmatizing efforts can go overboard, often falling to the fallacies of painting with a wide brush or hasty sweeping generalizations. The satirical Tyler-Baines Cadbury post above does carry the spirit of this problem. Same as when a person says, “stop stigmatizing shoplifters, they are poor and have trouble, so stop jailing them.” But the problem is that it comes off as wanting to give impunity to shoplifters. There was this feminazi I encountered in a forum who insisted that other people use “s/he” instead of he and she. The problem with that is they come off wanting to dictate other people. Or someone says, let’s stop jailing people with severe mental illnesses; so if serial killers are diagnosed with serious conditions, like Ed Gein and Ted Bundy, they might be let off the hook and allowed to do more killing.
A while back, we saw the now-infamous woman who wanted to de-stigmatize drug using with the sign “I am a drug user. Will you kill me?” Problem is, that message ended up promoting illegal behavior since narcotic drug use is outlawed. Rather than de-stigmatize, she helped further enforce the stigma. The is the stigma that being a narcotic user means that you are seeking escape without handling your responsibilities and therefore a sign of weakness.
Lately, ABS-CBN is in the news for apparent closure of its business. I’m ambivalent on this issue, so let me just focus on the station’s content. A local showbiz writer said that what ABS-CBN (and other local) shows are intended to de-stigmatize broken families and such. However, there is a risk of going overboard, in that it can cause the abnormal to be considered normal.
For example, shows may impart it’s OK to be a single mom, don’t be sad or oppressed that you’re a bum, do not look down on criminals, etc. But it’s having an unintended effect: inadvertently sanitizing the wrong. For example, single moms will oppose the family with a father present and just demand to be impregnated so they can have a child and own them. This will create a confused family situation. And on being a bum, while one should not be discouraged by it, they should do something to stop being it. If they’re still not looking for work, then they’re looking for trouble. Lastly, why stop looking down on criminals? They’re criminals, they did something to harm society!
Instead of encouraging people to solve problems, TV plot “de-stigmatizations” teach them to embrace the problem. Viewers will think, oh, so there’s no problem being a drunkard or a drug dealer… so let’s get drunk or do crimes because we’ll be loved anyway! It’s better if TV continue to portray a character suffering the consequences when they make a mistake, and help themselves through discontinuing the wrong decisions. That if a poor guy is lazy, they will stay poor; if he decides to get a job and do it well, he should be portrayed as doing well, and not be portrayed as becoming villainous because he is getting rich. And, TV writers should study the laws of our country (a local TV episode had separated parents quarreling over custody of a child, when the law already said the mother automatically has the child upon separation), and should stop making stories that glorify lawbreakers.
The body-positive movement also demonstrates a misguided attempt at de-stigmatization. Telling a person to go in front of a mirror and say to themselves, “I’m beautiful, I’m beautiful,” doesn’t really reduce the depression long term. Instead, it caters to vanity. It can even cause more depression when the person steps out and finds that the world reacts contrarily to their “mirror ritual thoughts.” It actually goes the opposite way from the real solution to esteem problems: just give up the vanity search. It’s better get away from the mirror and think, just keep calm and carry on, and, “I’m OK and happy without all that vanity.” We need to stop the glorification of obesity, as it still has greater health risks. Convincing people to shed off fat is not fat-shaming. Just don’t go extremes either, such as going paper thin. Remember the normal level as health experts recommend.
There are some things that can’t be de-stigmatized, because they’re just wrong. Pedophilia for instance. Someone might say, oh how poor the pedophile is, he just wants love; but that’s the wrong kind of “love,” and it must never be given. But that’s the thing: some de-stigmatizers want to de-stigmatize the wrong things. As a result, they twist right and wrong. There are some things that remain “stigma” simply because they are harmful to people and society.
De-stigmatization efforts need to be rethought. They should stop trying to appeal to emotions and appeal more to reason. The message should be emphasized that you cannot force people to accept you or something that you are trying to de-stigmatize. People should not be punished for not supporting de-stigmatization efforts, as that can be bullying. Seemingly innocent things such as trying to gain acceptance can still run the risk of violating others’ rights.
Remember, many cultures are based on stigmas. You can’t remove the stigma without removing the culture that created it. It starts at the grassroots. The philosophy at its root is the desire to get rid of anything undesirable. Stigma helps identify something undesirable to you can get rid of it later. Unless you remove this philosophy of removing undesirables, you can’t get rid of stigma.
It’s also better to call for more support for the individual rights of people. A stigma can only be broken if a person decides to drop it by themselves – similar to how you let Facebook users decide on what is fake or not for them, and not let anyone else decide for them. Stigma is something you can’t force away in a flash, but is a slow and steady process. One had better be willing to work that long, arduous process to the end. But of course, remember to ask the question: should I really de-stigmatize this thing, or am I twisting right and wrong?
Then you have things like the Blue Collar Logic Youtube channel that says we still need stigma in society. This is because there are still norms to follow, and things that are not normal may need to be dealt with because they may harm us. Norms may change, such as changing of laws promoting racism and violence, but their purpose is to keep society stable and livable.
Even if we want to de-stigmatize or stop violence against perceived deviants, let us not forget what is normal. Changing the norms does not always have good motives, so there is reason to suspect each attempt.",Others
Is it even possible to “boycott” Chinese products?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/is-it-even-possible-to-boycott-chinese-products/,"Sure, it’s possible to boycott Chinese products. But you’d first need to invent a time machine. You’d have to bring the Philippines back to a time when it had no more than a third of its current population. You’d need to find the sweet spot in its history over which it mined, grew, and made stuff for itself.
The first one is easy. There was actually a time back in the early 1970s when there were only about 35 million Filipinos living in the islands. This was a time when it was still possible to feed all of them off cultivable lands within the archipelago. The second one is a bit harder. There really was no one period in Philippine history where all three — mining, agriculture, and manufacturing — were done domestically at a scale that could meet local Filipinos’ needs and demands.
When George Barcelon, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that while effecting a boycott of Chinese products in the Philippines is technically possible, it will require a “huge sacrifice”, he essentially cites a sacrifice no sane modern consumer is willing to make.
Our relationship with China has many aspects. When it comes to trade, we need China’s supply because it makes a huge part of our supply chain, not only in domestic consumption but also our exports. Our raw materials are from China.
[…]
Not only are our goods from China, but also a lot of our food.
The Philippines does not suffer from a China problem per se. It’s problem lies in its chronic dependence. A vast global supply chain operates at a scale that enables mass extraction, processing, and shipping of raw materials to vast production facilities that turn these into finished goods at such enormous quantities that make their per-unit costs so small as to enable distributors and retailers to make them available to even impoverished consumers at affordable prices. Without global trade, the Philippines will have to rely on its traditional tingi economy — an economy of cottage industries and small cooperative distribution networks trading in small quantities.
Even if that time machine was built, and Filipinos given a second chance to industrialise in a more self-sufficient manner — without developing a pathetic addiction to imports — from such a subsistence domestic economy, it would have remained to be seen whether or not Filipino society and culture ever had what it takes to achieve the industrial scale that created the surpluses and capital that make First World countries such amazing places to live in today.
The foundation of national wealth is capital and capital is created from innovation that improves labour productivity. Filipinos lack the essential scientific and technological traditions that creates that capital which is why it has come to rely entirely on foreign input to sustain its enormous population. Without that foreign input — whether it be trinkets from China or Japanese engines to power its Jeepneys — Filipinos will have to make a huge sacrifice and opt for stone-age lifestyles in order to satisfy their daft jingoism and boycott Chinese products — or, for that matter, any non-Filipino product.",Others
Vice President Sara Duterte shouldn’t have said those things,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/vice-president-sara-duterte-shouldnt-have-said-those-things/,"This is, after all, an age when even “harmless” jokes can get you in trouble with HR at the office. What Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte did in what came across as a grave threat against Philippine President Bongbong Marcos is inexcusable. Duterte, after all, is second in line to the top job. Indeed, the whole point of her role as vice president is invoked if the president is rendered unable to fulfill his role in any way — such as if he is killed by an assassin.
Interestingly, that is exactly what Duterte reportedly suggests might happen.
Don’t worry about my security because I’ve talked with somebody. I said ‘if I’m killed, you’ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke…
Not a joke, as Duterte herself asserts.
This is not to discount the possibility that there may, indeed, be a threat to her life as she claims. Even then, the Vice President shouldn’t have said those things. What cannot be excused is her inability to get a grip. An ability to keep a level head and maintain one’s aim under fire is what sets apart a well-trained and seasoned soldier from a street thug armed with a recently-purchased (or stolen) paltik.
Imagine then what kind of president Sara Duterte would have made. She evidently is not her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, and possesses none of his gravitas. The daughter matches the father’s faculties for wit and tongue-in-cheek eloquence with no more than hysterics. Perhaps, the only thing she inherits from the former President is his vast cult following. It is precious capital she now wastes.
Then again, the Dutertards are exactly that — a cult following. Like the BTS Army, they will apply their mental faculties not to critical thinking but to the task of justifying every one of Sara Duterte’s infantile actions. They make an emotional choice and not an intellectual one as one might have observed of any cult following for that matter.
If Sara Duterte truly aspires to build on the immense political capital her father leaves her, she needs to step up and be a bigger person. Rather than rest on the assurances of her rabid fans, she needs to lead them to be better citizens. The alternative is to see her squander her father’s legacy or, worse, end up in prison. The former may not be in the cards yet, but the latter becomes a strong possibility with every ill thought out word she utters and with every adolescent theatric she delivers before the cameras. Filipinos who want to be better Filipinos deserve a bit more in a potential leader than that.
To be fair, there really isn’t much of a better landscape of options outside of the Duterte cult to begin with. Then again, this is Philippine politics where voters decide amongst lesser evils and not the best among the good.",Others
Is #GilasPilipinas coach Chot Reyes cursed by his support for Leni Robredo?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/08/is-gilaspilipinas-coach-chot-reyes-cursed-by-his-support-for-leni-robredo/,"Most basketball fans are a superstitious lot. Following an embarassing loss to the Dominican Republic in one of the first games of FIBA Basketball World Cup hosted in the Philippines this year, old questions regarding the competence of Gilas Pilipinas coach Chot Reyes are being raised again.
Observes social media personality Mark Lopez, “it was that last 5 minutes of the game which unmasked the systemic coaching problem of our National Team.” Lopez goes on to issue an indictment of the system that perpetuates these losses…
…when the consensus is that Gilas Pilipinas could have been performing better with a more cerebral head coach and program director who can really harness the amazing talent and skill of our players, pakinggan nyo.
The incompetence is glaring.
Most glaring of all is Reyes’s public endorsement of failed presidential candidate Leni Robredo in the lead up to the 2022 national elections. Yellowtard news organisation Rappler “reported” with glee back then how Reyes “threw his support behind Robredo through a minute-long video showing reasons why he wants to vote for the lone female presidential bet in the May elections.”
The only five-time PBA Coach of the Year said Robredo possesses the “puso” – Gilas Pilipinas’ battle cry – for the country and the Filipino people.
“Puso ay ang pagmamahal sa bayan na nakikita sa mga gawaing nakakaangat ng buhay ng ating mga kababayan,” Reyes said.
The trouble with all this is that bringing politics into sport divides rather than unites a people. Basketball is enjoyed by Filipinos of any colour, faith, or creed. Reyes does a disservice to the sport by dipping into a realm that can only bring trouble for him. Worse, it could bring bad luck for a team that Filipinos would like to have faith in.
Luck, bad or good, of course has nothing to do with winning or losing consistently. Having “heart” for the game — or any endeavour, for that matter — helps. Unfortunately for a people who are all “heart” and not much else, it takes a lot more than emotionalism to achieve.",Others
Filipinos need to Stop Believing in Famous Names,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/03/stop-believing-in-famous-names/,"Many Filipinos are too lazy to think and this is demonstrated in their voting habits and approach towards people. They think of the first name that comes to mind, or that is more familiar. There’s often no bother to dig up the history of the person. They probably assume, ah these guys will automatically do the job anyway, because they are famous names. Thus, we end up with other people lamenting, “why did these guys get voted?”
This belief in famous names is not just an effect of starstruck ignoramusness. Or rather, part of the starstruck ignoramusness is that Filipino culture promotes breadlosing; they want to live on hand-outs Juan Tamad-style. Connected to this behavior is sucking up to people who they believe can give them this, plus other favors.
In this time of Covid-19, there’s that obvious PR machinery buildup for Pasig mayor Vico Sotto, even to the point of making that premature and juvenile call for him to go for a national office. Still more starstruck ignoramusness (but most likely trolls), but it could mean the “opposition” is dropping Leni as their banner-holder and are looking for someone with more charisma (i.e. showbiz appeal) to be their figurehead.
But aside from this, fixation on famous names brings up another part of the Philippine psyche. Filipinos see fame as part of the road to getting the Juan Tamad lifestyle. As a result, there is a lot of crazy behavior Filipinos drag themselves down to just for this. For example, dumb Tiktokers, Filipinas leeching off foreigner husbands and that Filipino maid in Singapore who donned her employers’ clothes without permission.
Heroes’ Descendants Baloney
There are self-proclaimed descendants of heroes. Some believe that these people should continue to lead us, because, as the myth goes, “talent/greatness/put-in-your-magic-trait-here is in the blood.”
But being a descendant of a hero does not make one a hero; in fact, they can be the opposite. They become government officials and get embroiled in corruption. Even when not in government, they can still get into trouble in other ways.
It’s annoying when a descendant boasts his “hero heritage,” implying that he is always right and he is superior to everyone. That is toxic entitled arrogance. Even if he is a descendant, he deserves no honor. It’s better to avoid people like them.
We have to stop believing that greatness, talent, intelligence, good character and such are genetic influences. Rather, they are the result of decisions people make. Leadership is not destined, but earned.
I also understand that some descendants carry the name and feel that people expect of them to be a “hero” in their own way. I call baloney on this. Nothing of the sort should be expected of them. And they should stop assuming that they need to live up to their own name. Just living a decent private life is better.
When I voted in the 2016 and 2019 elections, I decided to look for unfamiliar names and research on them. While I still put in a few familiar ones, like Dick Gordon, I believe I should have gone for all unknowns but with specific platforms I like, such as charter change. Better to have those people than familiar ones who don’t know what they’re doing. I have willingness to try unfamiliar ground in elections, and perhaps other people should be encouraged to do the same.
Resisting Others’ Charms
I also implied in a past article that we should learn to resist the charms of other people. Filipino culture teaches us to give in to bola-bola and be taken in by others. Perhaps some misanthrope tendencies should be taught more widely. Teaching our kids not to trust strangers should be supplemented by teaching them to be careful of the charms of other people. Helping in that would be teaching them to avoid wanting to please people or seeking validation.
We should also learn to stop being taken in by someone’s appearance. We should remember sayings like, “beauty goes only skin deep,” which is often proven in divorces by men from their lovely but toxic wives (or perhaps some would like to cite Mocha Uson). Same with someone who is a “young politician.” Oh c’mon, you think being young means being untainted? You obviously haven’t learned of corruption in Sangguniang Kabataan.
We should excise this tendency to follow famous names and teach resistance to it. Wokes and commies keep on crying “revolution,” but the kind of revolution they want is stupidity and bunk. A real revolution would be getting rid of our showbiz ignoramusness. We’d best get on it now.",Others
Erik Matti whines about K-dramas instead of rallying the local industry to step up,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/erik-matti-whines-about-k-dramas-instead-of-rallying-the-local-industry-to-step-up/,"Thanks to this pandemic, people have more time in their hands to binge-watch on Netflix and the like without guilt.  After all, staying home is considered an act of valor these days, with the national government even threatening to do a Martial Law type of enforcement against people who err on quarantine protocols.  So this is a rare instance when you can simply sit back and do nothing but watch all day and come out of the ordeal feeling like you have done your share for your fellow men.
So it’s no surprise that Netflix and social media would take the top spot as the most time-consuming activities these days. And it’s also in Netflix that  Filipino filmmaker Erik Matti found information that made him rant on Twitter against K-dramas that have apparently taken a hold on the country as far as patronage and viewership is concerned.
According to reports that quoted his tweet, the director was not too happy about the dominance of Korean dramas among the Pinoy market. He went on to describe them as “Faux cinderella stories with belofied actors whiter than white”.  And went on to how could people watch things about “love” in the middle of a pandemic.
Had these tweet been done by a highly opinionated nobody like me on Twitter, it would have been totally fine. In the scheme of things, we all have our say on matters that do not have a great impact on the world with or without our precious opinions added to their existence.
But this is a Filipino director talking shop and making his thoughts known about international competition that we’re talking about here. And to be blunt about it, talking trash about the competition for outplaying you and blaming the consumers or the audience (watching “love stories” in the middle of a pandemic) for not supporting local fare is a defeatist, self-pitying stance that is not only counter-productive, but also comes across as garden-variety whining: It’s always somebody’s fault.
To be fair about it, a number of people on Twitter responded directly to Matti’s tweet, calling him out on his negligence to mention the deplorable quality of our local dramas. A Twitter user summed it up accurately:
I’d rather see kdrama that has sense and depth and tackles taboo topics that I can gain knowledge from than the topics of the dramas in the Philippines that would ALWAYS have kabit, barilan, patayan, sampalan, kidnapping etc. So you want us to watch Tagalog dramas? Give us better.
Perhaps the next time Erik Matti issues an opinion about how “bad” things are because the industry is being dominated by the international competition, it would be about stepping up and applying continuous improvement as work ethics instead of simply relying on credentialism and artistic integrity as ways to entice an audience.",Others
We are Deceived to Crave Likes on Social Media,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/likes-and-dislikes/,"A man who rode his motorcycle up to the altar in the Taal Basilica and sat on the priest’s chair might have not done it for Likes (he did it under the influence of pot). But many other people do similar dumb things for the sake of Likes or clout.
Facebook, Youtube and other social media platforms are filled with Like buttons. “Content creators” who have periodic uploads on their channels fish for Likes on the impression that they will receive money from these. Or, they fish for Likes to stoke their ever-hungry ego, which is called “Main Character Syndrome.”
I started writing this article during the rash of online “challenges” like Tide-pod eating, blackout/choking challenge, and Birdbox challenge. These days, we have that incident in Taal as well as Tiktok idiocies and stunts from “content creators” that go wrong (like having selfies at trains and getting injured or killed in the process), so it is still timely. Young impressionable people with their not-so-developed brains are easily tricked into doing dumb things for the sake of clout.
They are also made to believe that making money is as easy as making funny faces during a selfie, while the reality is that views and likes don’t always translate into money. Youtube and other platforms have stringent rules on monetization which have discouraged and even stopped some content creators’ channels. Young wannabe content creators likely have no idea of the work they need to do. Plus, one dumb mistake and it’s all over, like what happened to once-famous Youtubers like Mr. Beast and Nas Daily.
There is no shortage of commentators who deem the collection of Likes a futile lifestyle, one that can be adverse to mental (and even physical) health. Like-hunters assume that they are building a great career or propping up their dignity, when in fact they are just being made to spend money on Like-hunting products and serve business interests. Some who feel they have failed to get enough Likes get depressed and sometimes commit suicide. This makes it worth talking about Like-craving as a major problem.
Likes and Clout are not entitlements
I know that people naturally want to be liked. However, it does not justify demanding likes and holding the idea that other people not “liking” them should be considered hateful. If you don’t give people the Likes they are fishing for, even if there is no dislike (meaning there’s an in-between), you are called a bigot or other such slur. “You have no appreciation for other people,” “you don’t care about others,” or other such moral gaslights. You have to Like people or else you’ll be pounced on by the deceived, maddened mob.
One of the problems here is the application of false dichotomy, in which people demand that either you like or hate something, there can be no in-between. That is untrue; there is an in-between wherein you don’t like something but you know how to let it go and don’t need to hate it. We may call it ambivalence, which is a legitimate thing. However, people with partisan mentality like social justice warriors and unsophisticated Filipinos hate it. They carry the George Bush attitude of “either you’re with me or against me.” They hate the right of other people to be ambivalent (in the end, they will hate others’ rights at all) because they want everybody to side with them. But, first of all, why demand people to “side” with you, is there really conflict in this?
My theory is that this fixation on Likes actually draws from the survival instinct, although the Like-hunters will claim that it is part of a drive for higher level actualization. It comes out as “I’m proud, so don’t step on me,” but it can devolve into, “I’m proud of myself so you should like me and validate me so I can like myself!” However, other people are more likely to interpret it as looking for a fight. That’s why I see loud self-projection like pride marches as little more than narcissism. It actually doesn’t help their goal of survival and it may actually reveal that the person is insecure about themselves.
Some may reason that you need to like people or else they may get ostracized or killed. But for me, if you are worried about not being liked, then you might actually approve of the culling mentality itself, that ostracizing or killing some people is justified. It’s the victim joining the victimizer. It’s better to believe that people have the right to live despite being unliked. Others’ dislikes or such should not affect them.
“Girly Group” Dynamics
Another theory I have is that it is one small group assuming that everyone should be like themselves. Youtuber and writer Abbie Emmons, in her advice video titled “7 Cringey MISTAKES Writers Make with MALE Characters,” advised aspiring writers to remember that “guy groups don’t act like girl groups” (and vice versa). Her explanation was that women are like a flock of sheep, an effervescent cloud of compliments and nurturing energy (though she flashed a subtitle saying “but not mean girls,” acknowledging the dark side of women). Guy groups on the other hand are more like wolfpacks, with banter and ironic humor, but that is not a bad thing. There is more individuality in guy groups – that is a really good thing.
It occurred to me that social media toxicity is the girls’ “complimenting each other” mentality being unnecessarily magnified. Many people, including males, have taken on these “girly attitudes” that they feel entitled to compliments. And if they don’t get compliments, they attack those people perceived to have “failed” in giving these. Feminists and LGBTQ+ “activists” are likely among those trying to push “girly attitudes” on others. It is a bad idea that led to widespread arrogance and toxicity. The male attitude counterbalances this, because it is more like, letting an insult slide because it is just banter, and so you don’t demand compliments. Let compliments come organically.
The Myth of Universal Taste
One other aspect about Likes and Dislikes is how people want others to have the same Likes and Dislikes as them. Instead of respecting differences, they want to insist that everybody be the same. But, as I said in my article about the topic, such people will want everyone else to follow them rather than be willing to accept others’ ideas. This is selfishness.
One of my points in my articles about Art and Sameness Insistence is that people are born with the right to different Likes and Dislikes. People who want everyone who have the same Likes likely hate others’ rights to be different. An aggressive desire for Likes can lead to disrespect for others, and encourages narcissism and true selfishness.
I also tend to be skeptical of those who claim that they can “like everything.” I doubt that liking everything is actually a sign of moral superiority; in fact, it can be more of a deception and hypocrisy. I agree with the Biblical passage “everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial.” It implies that not everything is good, so not everything needs to be liked. Should you like even the things that harm or offend you? So it doesn’t make sense to “like everything.” They may use the gaslight, “if you don’t appreciate everything, you’re immoral/a bigot/ bad/etc.” This is nothing more than a narcissist trying to impose their way on others.
Ultimately, everything is niche, no specific cultural taste or such can ever be universal, and we will all be different in the end. Likes and dislikes differing with each individual is the norm.
Dislike ≠ Hatred
Dislike is not hatred. The range from Like to Dislike to Hate has degrees. A simplistic “either you like it or hate it” approach reflects lack of understanding. The simplistic approach is also a tool for seeding hatred and inciting people to attack others.
The reason for proper treatment of other people is not based on Likes, but on respect and basic decency. Treat people with respect whether you like them or not.  If you mistreat people you don’t like, that is abuse and malice. People have the right to live as they want whether they are liked or not. This is best mentality to have in order to get through life without voraciously seeking Likes or trying to shut down others’ Dislikes.",Others
On Liberation Theology and Ivory Tower Mentality,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/02/liberation-theology-ivory-tower/,"I went through the liberation theology subject during my last college year at Ateneo (1996-97). We got immersed in an Aeta reservation in Bataan for a few days. It’s an attempt to make us “privileged” students aware of the plight of poorer people in remote areas, with the part-expectation that we would return and try to help them with some sort of “charity.” Perhaps a few did, though I remember some returned with more the intention of leisure than help.
But even if real help came, help for the long term is rare. Short-term assistance is the likely kind that students will give. It will not work without the intention of teaching the “fish-receiver” to go fishing themselves. That’s one flaw of “liberation” theology.
Another flaw of this ideology is its basis on the rich-versus-poor conflict. Let’s say you’ve got a job in this world’s “capitalist” system and bought luxury goods for yourself. Liberation theology implies that you stole from poor people just by gaining wealth. That’s accusing someone of a crime they never committed.
Mother Teresa seems to be one figurehead of liberation theology. She’s been in a lot of controversy lately. One of her charity houses has been closed by police after children were found to have been sold from it. But aside from this, critics especially hit her controversial core beliefs, especially saying that “suffering is beautiful.” It’s implied that she rigged her charity houses to keep people poor, to make sure people stay suffering – because it’s beautiful for her. That is contrary to Biblical teaching that encourages relieving or removing suffering.
The Ivory Bubble
I hold that in monastic orders such as Mother Teresa’s charity, their being locked away for a long time affects their views of the real world. Trapped in a bubble, they are forced to see the world through a colored lens. They often are unable to see other lenses. Their bubble limits their understanding of the world
But this is not just limited to clergy. This attitude is borne by lay or ordinary people as well, especially those who are spoiled by their ivory tower lifestyles. Perhaps some have mothers who would scream, after the children bought a snack for themselves, “how dare you buy for yourself! Next time, when you buy a snack, buy for everybody!” Those who give in to this would begin to make a habit of treating people out, though for no reason. I respect more the people who resist this.
Then it moves to children seeing more of the world, such as the provinces, squatter areas, or people poorer than them. They are so used to their own lifestyle that they are shocked upon seeing others in different states of life. But there are certain beliefs that can add to a person’s reactions to what they experience. One belief is to accept that one’s lifestyle and ideals are different from others, and they accept this, there’s no need to make the other the same as you. The other is to believe that one’s own lifestyle and ideals are the only right ones and should be the standard for all, so if others are do not live by them, one must enforce it on the others. Musician and famed “ambassador” to white supremacists Daryl Davis is the former. He accepts and befriends white supremacists despite their beliefs. The latter is what leads to people becoming “woke.”
In other words, being spoiled tends to create these knee-jerk “caring for the world” idealists. These kinds of people could have joined the monastic orders I described and or become laity who use the church, schools and other places tools for spreading out their ideals. They may become school administrators of the likes of St. Scholastica and subversive “revolutionists” in U.P. and in the mountains, with the goal of imposing their ideas on the world.
How One Goes Woke
Some of these people might also have been raised with servants in the house. They grew up with “assistance” and little independence. Then they see people in the poor areas of this country and other countries. They get shocked and say, “these people need assistance!” without taking a closer look and understanding how different people’s ways of life are. Still driven by the idea that everything must be the same as them, they become like the child who throws a tantrum because a person refuses to do what they say.
Since they believe that their way is right, they desire to make it a hegemony and force it on the world. If someone disagrees with that, they want to get rid of that someone. They join the terrorist New People’s Army to get the means to do that. They look for easy scapegoats to blame, such as President Duterte, based on barbers’ tales (kwentong barbero) of people executed en masse by him. But in the process, they themselves become murderers, and support people who are also murderers.
Other similar people might find someone who doesn’t give to the poor at all, they will publicly scorn such a person. They tend to believe that goodness and giving should be forced. They will promote reckless giving, even if such giving is actually terrible and could help the wrong people. Such people become reckless in other things as well.
One such reckless belief is the Mother Teresa one described above. It’s based on the idea that if you can’t make poor people as rich as others, then pull the rich ones down and make them poor. That is probably why suffering could become beautiful – it’s revenge. It’s reckless, stupid and wrong.
The problem with such people is that they are not willing to check whether their beliefs could be mistaken. They are seized by a stubborn arrogance and self-deception with a touch of Dunning-Kruger effect. My way of life is right and perfect, I cannot be wrong! So they hate people who are not like themselves.
The feeling of invincibility of youth makes it easy for them to believe this. The irony is, they often join such “activism” saying their parents are “dictators,” but when they go out and do their thing, they are dictators themselves. They’re so out of touch with reality that they call living a normal life “adulting.”
The attitude above is not liberation. On the other hand, it is enslavement. Such people are enslaved by their bubbles and narcissism, leading them to deceive themselves that the wrong they do is right. They are not free; they are slaves of their desire to shape the world according to themselves.
The Real Kind of Liberation
A myth about empathy is that, if you’re not carried away by the emotion of the moment (in Tagalog, hindi ka nadadala ng damdamin) , you have no empathy. Ergo, you are uncaring and evil. No. If you get carried away by emotion, it does not result in useful action. It more likely results in knee-jerk reactions. This is what I believe drives the monastic orders and ivory tower laity to the kind of beliefs I described above. True empathy has thinking along with feeling. You try to understand with sobriety what one needs, and you are careful not to force what you assume they need.
So I imply that the wokes are not following Biblical doctrine when they claim to be; they are deviating from it and using their own interpretation in its place. This is what I pointed out in my article “We are not our brother’s keeper.” I attend an evangelical Christian church instead of a Catholic one, and we do not promote reckless giving. Help is better when purposeful and not reckless. It also reminds us of the part of the Bible that says he who refuses to work should not eat, and that ildeness is a source of a lot of wrongdoing in the world (2 Thes. 3: 6-12). Anyone who promotes freeloading while defending it and denying that it is idleness are doing wrong.
So wokes want to liberate others from things such as poverty, disease, corruption, and more. But people are limited. For example, wokes assume that bringing down a dictator such as Marcos or Duterte will immediately bring in a golden age. But history has shown that after deposing one dictator, another or even more, worse, ones will replace them. They might start a feeding or aid program in another country, but might get shocked later on that their program did not work or the aid got stolen. That’s how reality is; just because you have a good idea does not mean it will always work. We are not entitled to success in everything we do.
Another angle to this is that the wokes hate the feeling of powerlessness. Facebook shares, attacking perceived “dictators” and “dictators supporters,” forcing people to give and share and attacking people with different values from theirs is all for gaining a sense of power. Problem is, that kind of power is corrupted and selfish, because they’re doing it all for themselves, not for others. They have to accept powerlessness in life in certain areas.
Another thing about life they need to learn: hardship is not always man-made, and thus isn’t something that you should find someone to blame for. It comes naturally, and we should accept it and go through it.
You might ask me, so you don’t want people to be liberated from suffering? Of course I do. But we must do it the right way.
Self-empowerment is liberating. Cutting down entitlement is liberating. Learning to let go when we need to is liberating. Accepting that the world will not obey us and doesn’t need us is liberating. Not being demanding is liberating.
But here’s something that “liberationists” will hate: Sometimes, you have to liberate people from yourself. You have to let people solve their own problems. You can encourage and assist, but never take over from them.
I encourage such people within the liberation theology school, or any forced sharing/giving/”goodness” school, to rethink their ideals. When they move on to more practical ideals, they will realize how wrong and useless ousting “dictators” and forcing their “goodness” on the world are. They will realize that no one can control the world, and such desire for control is what the “evil ones” really do.",Others
When Will Filipinos Wake Up? More Betrayals from the US,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/when-will-filipinos-wake-up-more-betrayals-from-the-us/,"Once again, Filipinos find themselves betrayed by a supposed ally. The United States regularly claims that the Philippines is a “friend,” “partner,” and “ally,” but history and present reality tell a different story; one of exploitation, manipulation, and abandonment.
Henry Kissinger once said, “It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy, but to be America’s friend is fatal.” For the Philippines, this has proven painfully true.
A Historical Pattern of Exploitation
The relationship between the Philippines and the United States has always been unequal. From the very beginning, America’s so-called friendship has come at a steep cost to the Filipino people:
Colonial conquest under false pretences
The US justified its occupation of the Philippines in 1898 by claiming to “civilize” Filipinos. In reality, it was a brutal war of conquest, with over a million Filipinos dead and Filipino resistance labeled as “insurrection.”
Forced Parity Rights
After “granting” independence in 1946, the US forced the newly sovereign Philippines to amend its constitution to allow Americans the same economic rights as Filipinos. This wasn’t partnership— it was economic colonization.
World War II betrayal
Over 250,000 Filipino soldiers fought under the American flag during World War II, promised equal benefits and citizenship rights. After the war, the US rescinded these promises. Veterans died waiting for justice and compensation that came decades too late—if it came at all.
Damages by US military bases
For decades, the US operated bases on Philippine soil. The damages left behind—environmental destruction, broken communities, and economic dependency—was never compensated adequately.
Repeated interference in domestic affairs
From supporting and abandoning dictators like Marcos Sr. when it suited them, to pushing one-sided policies that benefited US corporations at the expense of Filipinos, America has constantly meddled in Philippine internal matters, always under the guise of “help.”
Modern-Day Betrayal: A Friend in Name, a Bully in Practice
Fast forward to today, and nothing has changed.
The Philippines continues to give America everything, yet receives little in return:
One-sided visa policies. Americans can enter the Philippines visa-free. Filipinos, meanwhile, endure long lines, humiliating interviews, and must pay thousands just to apply for a US visa—no guarantee of approval.
Tariffs and trade barriers. Even as the Philippines bends over backward to please Washington, the US has not hesitated to impose tariffs and sanctions that hurt Filipino businesses and consumers.
US military expansion—on our dime. Under the guise of “defense,” the Philippines has opened its doors to more American military bases that we host and maintain, paid for by Filipino taxpayers’ money. This has increased tensions in the region and put the Philippines on the frontline target of America’s enemies!
Filipinos jailed and mistreated in the US. From documented OFWs being jailed and deported, to Filipinos being among the top victims of anti-Asian hate crimes, the “special relationship” clearly doesn’t protect the lives and dignity of our people abroad.
Overpriced and outdated weapons. Our own Ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, proudly facilitated arms deals that will cost the Philippines ₱350 billion for outdated missile systems—while millions of Filipinos go hungry. This is not diplomacy. This is betrayal.
The F-16 deception
As part of the supposed “modernization” of our military, the US is pushing the Philippines to purchase F-16 fighter jets, even though these aircraft are decades old and cost more than newer, more advanced models from other countries. While nations like South Korea and Turkey develop or acquire stealth fighters and drone squadrons at a lower cost, the Philippines is being sold overpriced, obsolete hardware—further deepening our dependency while draining our limited defense budget.
The Illusion of Partnership
The United States continues to treat the Philippines not as a sovereign partner, but as a dependent colony. Military agreements, trade deals, diplomatic engagements—always tilt in favor of American profits.
Remember when former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shamelessly admitted: “We lied, we cheated, we stole.” These words aren’t just rhetoric—they reflect a foreign policy doctrine that sees allies as pawns, and Filipino lives as expendable.
Time to Wake Up
Filipinos have long been generous with our friendship and forgiving in our judgment.
But there comes a time when we must ask:
How many more betrayals must we suffer before we assert our dignity as a nation?
The Filipino people deserve better than to be endlessly used by foreign powers.
We must reassess our so-called alliances. Real friendship is based on respect and reciprocity—not manipulation and abuse.
It is time to wake up.",Others
Sameness Insistence is A Major Cause of Conflict in the World,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/11/sameness-insistence/,"If we all become the same, will we finally have peace in the world?
I think not.
In fact, I think that such an attitude, which I’ll call sameness insistence, is one of the causes of wrongdoing and suffering in the world.
First, think of the times when people demand that all be the same. Who would be the basis of sameness? Of course, themselves. Even if other persons may actually have better ideas, values, practices, or propositions, they will insist that everyone follow them. So if some one tells me, being different means you are selfish, I beg to differ. As long as one makes oneself the basis for others to follow, sameness insistence is selfish. What’s worse, if other persons refuse to be like the sameness insister, the latter will want those differers punished, at times to the point of having them killed. If you ask the sameness insisters to follow someone else’s idea, they’ll be hopping mad (“Why should I follow someone else? I am the one who’s right! I am offended”). They are the ones who will be dictators even if they claim to be against dictators.
Marxism is one of those belief systems that turn people into these “sameness karens.” Sameness insistence though first occurs in old folk beliefs, tribal societies and other such cultures, primitiveness that seems to fascinate Marxists and similar. All over the world, some quarters of society will assume that achieving sameness is the right state of things, the state of paradise. Same beliefs, same habits, same manners, same approach to all situations, eat the same food, have the same kind of house, wear the same kind of clothes, etc.
Actually, that would be a nightmare world.
Bigotry and Sameness Insistence
People were riled up about racism in the US after the death of George Floyd. But they should realize that sameness insistence is the very premise of racism. Why? Apparently people see one’s own race as the norm. Anyone not of the race is the enemy or a threat to survival. Discrimination is based on the notion that you should treat someone well only if they are equal with or the same as you and different people are to be mistreated.
This racism problem is not limited to Western countries; it is present in all people and societies, whether Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, Native America, and more. Communists, Nazis, Khmer Rouge, Stalinists/Soviets, old tribes who set out to destroy enemy tribes. Discrimination and bigotry are rooted in culture, so to address these, cultural change is necessary.
If people were serious about ending any form of discrimination, they would end sameness insistence and accept differences and distinctions as the norm. Hasn’t it been the said by the true peacemakers that you should not oppress those who are different? Thus, peacemakers should not insist on sameness.
The answer against discrimination and conflict is not the homogenization of all people, but accepting people and their differences. Instead of requiring sameness before acceptance, practice acceptance without demanding conformity. If you find some differences offensive, best practice reason and patience because you might actually be offended over a non-issue.
Differences are Natural and Keep Us Alive
As is my observation on many other things, sameness insistence is one of the ways people try to obtain security and is a reaction to the difficulties of physical life. Difference is seen as an existential threat. But that seems to be a cognitive dissonance when you look more closely at the reality.
Nature makes us all different. While we all have the same fundamental needs, such as food, water, air, and mental stimulation, we have many differences in height, weight, facial features, tastes, talents, abilities, allergies, and genetic disorders. When trying to cancel out these differences and insisting on sameness, people oppose nature and reality.
For example, a person with a food allergy wants to ban other people from eating the food as well to force solidarity or parity. But that is also selfishness (or the “naghahanap ng karamay”/misery loves company mentality). A militant vegan/vegetarian who wants to ban other people from eating meat is another example. They may claim that they are helping other people by doing so, but they are actually doing it for themselves. It goes for the other side too, people who want to force others with food allergies to eat the allergenic food or force vegans to eat meat.
Now some may remark, these differences are so inconvenient and cruel. But that’s the reality. I would turn it around and say that differences are in fact our friend in in dealing with the difficulties of reality and helping with our survival. Sameness insistence may even harm our chances of survival.
If people demand something that is in limited supply, they are likely to fight over it because it will be depleted quickly. Imagine if all people are only pork-eaters and didn’t eat chicken or beef. Pork would probably be long depleted or people would be waging wars over it. Since they all ate the same, if that same resource gets depleted and they eat nothing else, then they all starve. Different tastes help us survive.
If we all had the same vulnerabilities and sicknesses, such as allergies, then we all go down together when the same pathogen or allergen strikes us all. If your doctor is like this, they get sick and die with you. Or, think of a drowning person caught in a deadly undercurrent. The one who could save a drowning person should not also be caught in the undercurrent, which puts them in a different position. If they are on the shore or on a nearby boat, they can throw a life preserver or a rope, or just go near and pull the person up. Jumping into the water to drown together with the person, the “nakikiramay” attitude (it may seem kind but it is also misguided), only increases the number of casualties. If we were all club-footed, for example, how can anyone run?
When people pull together and work together in times of need, it is not a way of making them all the same. Rather, it is the useful application of their differences; different talents, skills and knowledge, in different roles and tasks. Not everyone can be a farmer, carpenter, leader, doctor, or whatever you name. I’ll bet no one can successfully multitask in all those roles, as people are limited.
Lack of differences also stifles innovation and forward thinking that builds societies. Innovations come from people who came up with a different thought from their contemporaries, leading to inventions like nitrogen fertilizer, refrigeration, cargo containers, medical advances, and the Internet. This runs counter to the tendency of Filipinos to simply imitate their neighbor when going into business or such. That happened with the marble makers of Romblon, shawarma, mik tea, barbecues, fries and many others. Many iterations of the same business exist side-by-side in the same area, causing saturation and making them more likely to die out. Then the owners look only for the next business fad instead of thinking up something unique that they can sustain. This demonstrates Filipinos’ lack of creativity and fear of doing things differently.
Sameness and Equality: Not the Same
Sameness is often seen as synonymous with equality, so say Marxists especially. I think not. In an analogy that I used in my personal blog, suppose there are two people, one is born big, the other small. Let’s say the big person eats two pounds of food a day. The small person eats one pound a day. Each has different needs to be equally satisfied. That is all right.
But it’s not all right for sameness fanatics like Marxists. They will want both to eat the same amount: one pound or two pounds both. But would this be right? Either the big guy eats too little, or the small guy eats too much. They wouldn’t be properly satisfied.
The “Weird Solution” some will propose is to make the bigger person eat less and the smaller person eat more. They assume it will lead to the heights or builds of the said people adjusting until they become the same. This is ridiculous of course, because it ignores the actual rules of biology. I’d also call it improper use of resources.
Equality here does not depend on people eating the same amount but on the end result, which is being appropriately filled after eating. People have different levels of being filled. Making everyone eat the same amount will never solve world hunger. All efforts at achieving equality through sameness will fail because that is not how reality works. Catering to each and every person’s differences is still the better solution towards the ideal world.
Now there’s the issue of haves and have-nots. I say not all have-nots are bad; not everybody needs to own the same things. For example, I’m a scale modeler and have scale models, or an artist with art supplies. Does that mean others should have scale models and art supplies too? No. Why would they need it if they are not artists or modelers? Then others will say, give out your scale models and art supplies, redistribute your wealth! Or, get rid of your models and art supplies, as we have determined that you should not have them so you can be equal to others! Nah. That’s what you call tyranny.
Disparity is not automatically injustice. What we find wrong are the effects noticed among the disparities: hunger, disease, abuse, bullying, etc. But disparity is not the only cause of these things and disparity does not always lead to them. Claims of disparity can also be subjective at times. I believe that people have to look more closely at each case and understand the nuances.
The pic for this article is a funny meme showing poor office ergonomics. I’m using it as a demonstration of imposing sameness on people, such as expecting them to fit equally in the same space. You can’t, and a bigger guy will need bigger space. Best cater to it. Of course, people will be all up in arms saying, you’re so unfair, you oppressor, you evil person! That will never change the reality of different needs.
Sameness insistence leads to Totalitarianism
Despite Marxism’s claim that each will get what they need (from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs), it will fail to deliver because it is a sameness insistence ideology. To accomplish what it seeks, it deprives people of individuality and the right to control one’s own life. It is nothing but totalitarianism (as any other sameness insistence culture other than Marxism will lead to).
I know this question will be raised: Shouldn’t we all have the same values? If we achieve the state wherein all believe that differences should be accepted by all without anyone getting angry, doesn’t that make us the same? Why yes, for this particular value, this is the right kind of sameness! While nuance remains key in understanding this, this is still the eventual state that I hope society reaches.
Of course, I understand that forcing others to accept my values and beliefs is wrong. Writing this article isn’t forcing but sharing ideas for other to see if they find it worth applying. The ones more guilty of forcing others to accept their values are the woke and the Leftists (or even karens, super-conservatives, and tribal people) who seem to oppose everything that does not agree with them.
The Gaslighting of “Different” as “Evil”
Let’s say people have differences that are so abhorrent to you. For example, “Yellows” think of supporters of Bongbong Marcos or Rodrigo Duterte as evil, and some Americans see Donald Trump as evil incarnate. However, instead of saying “don’t vote for these people,”, they said, “vote for my candidate or you are evil!” – sameness insistence. Or, on the Ukraine War, some people want you to fervently voice support for Ukraine and not be neutral, or contribute to funds for Ukraine. You have to pick a side, because if you are neutral, or you don’t donate to Ukraine and such, you are on the side of the oppressor (as Marxism puts it, on the wrong side of history)! This is gaslighting in order to find a reason to go on a witch-hunt against people who disagree.
Another erroneous mindset I see in some sameness insisters is, if we don’t have the same values, the world will collapse! Not true, though. We are already in a world where people have different values and it’s not collapsing. Atrocious and heinous things may be happening, but they’ve been happening for years without the world collapsing. If anything can make the world collapse, it would be when sameness insisters have their way.
The wokes claim to be for diversity (DEI – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion). But they are actually sameness insisters. They are not actually pushing for diversity, but want everybody to be the same as them. DEI is just a cover for a power move to get people fired and take an institution so that those who take over can impose their agenda on others. Connections to communism aren’t farfetched, especially since the Chinese government has connections to companies with DEI/ESG programs. Supporters and skeptics of this claim will call it a conspiracy theory, red-tagging or such. However, already too many voices are raising the alarm and it is not that easily dismissed.
Other Pitfalls of Sameness Insistence
Marketers and sellers take advantage of sameness insistence to gaslight people to buy things and of people’s fear of being different. In selling a product, they try to make you afraid of not having the same product as others, with the message that you’ll get ostracized or ridiculed for being “uncool.” And then you also come to ostracize others who don’t have it. You become Stockholm-Syndromed into commercial bigotry. If you don’t feel the need to be the same as others, you won’t be taken by this tactic (and, those who apply this tactic should be taken to task).
Sameness insistence can also become a pitfall in leadership. Some “leaders”  believe that it’s best to make their subordinates the same as them, especially if they are accomplished people whose success has gotten to their heads (or even those who think they’re accomplished but are delusioned). Not only may they require subordinates to adopt their exact principles and practices, but they may able to make these subordinates suffer the same abuse as they did. They may claim making others go through the same bad experiences as them will make those others understand them. Nope, that’s spreading one’s own misfortune to other people. Good leaders seek to prevent what they suffered from happening to their subordinates. They also identify the differences in a team and use them for the benefit of everyone.
Filipino culture of course, being very tribalist, has rabid sameness insistence. Get Real Philippines has been criticizing this part of Filipino culture from the start. Stubborn insularism and tribalist attitudes have been stifling innovation and improvement and have been keeping the country backward in comparison with much of the developed world.
I also believe multiculturalism efforts (such as lax immigration policies) are doomed to fail because they fail to take into account sameness insistence. A multicultural society does not work because most of the people thrust into it carry their tribal backwardness with them. They will still look only for people who are the same as them and will be hostile to those who are different. Also, multiculturalism may also be applied with the assumption that people will eventually become the same; this is a dangerous assumption. It’s better not to force multiculturalism in the end.
In my articles about music and art, I emphasized that people have different tastes because that is what makes things more enjoyable. If all people have the same taste, it would mean that they’ve lost their free will and their “taste” is not real. It may have happened that someone imposed their taste on everyone. Such tastes would not be sincere and are therefore false. Thus, having different tastes means we are still human and free.
Overcoming the Sameness Insistence Bug
Trying to make others the same as you will not help them understand you. We can never literally get into another person’s head and feel exactly the same things that they felt in order to understand them. The act of understanding by itself has the concept of being outside of someone else; that’s why you’re trying to understand them in the first place. If you can approximate the idea about another person’s experience, you can already understand or have empathy for them. The inability to perfectly understand others is not wrong. It is a mistake by humanity to assume that failure to perfectly understand another is evil. The resulting response if they assume this is to *force* understanding.
I also see sameness insistence as related to any belief, religious or otherwise, that promotes monism or the merging of everything into one. Usually, these beliefs will posit that individuality and people’s differences are abnormalities. To become “normal,” we work towards deindividuation, break down individual identities, and get absorbed into a whole, a hive-mind (maybe like the Eternals merging into the Uni-Mind in Marvel Comics). Everyone will become the same, everything will be become one form, everyone will think the same thoughts and be in unison in all actions and other things like that. That’s just like John Carpenter’s “The Thing,” a nightmare.
According to Marx’s writings, man is estranged from himself (unable to achieve ultimate godhood, according to James Lindsay) because of the division of labor. Division of labor could be understood as differences in life. Basically, we are can’t become “god” if we don’t eliminate all our differences and become all the same.
Why do people insist on sameness despite evidence that it could be harmful? Well, one seeming reason is that they don’t know any better. The assumption of sameness for all is a perception brought about by shortsightedness and ignorance. People tend to act on what little they know and they lack knowledge on the differences that are out there. When they encounter those differences, they react violently. Or, maybe people just don’t care, similar to cars drivers who don’t care if their actions endanger others on the road. They don’t care even if they know that their actions to enforce their ideals on others causes harm.
Also, I also think sameness insistence is caused by the illusions in the mind brought about by deindividuation or groupthink. When you’re accepted in a group and you feel that you’re all the same with them, there’s a bit of a warm fuzzy feeling from the feel-good brain chemicals. While this is not bad at first, the problem is when a person decides to embrace deindividuation at all costs. It will lead to the person becoming more susceptible to proposals to commit wrongdoing without any remorse.
Many dollops of life wisdom support accepting differences over sameness insistence. I recall that, as a kid, I would expect other people to be the same as me. But as I grow up, I learn that I should accept people’s differences and treat them with respect. Sameness insistence partly stems from immaturity. Also, the advice “don’t compare yourself to others” can mean “you don’t need to be the same as others.”
Difference is Being, Existing
Differences also serve an ontological purpose. If everyone were completely the same, with no distinctions or differences whatsoever, they’re all clones, drones, or zombies. In a way, it’s like they don’t exist. Differences are among the signs of being, proof of existence. I would argue that sameness insistence (especially in the way Marxists, woke, and similar want) is a vicious assault on being.
People should not see differences and inequalities between people as “lamang” or taking advantage of others (Filipinos especially are obsessed with being “lamang”). Different treatment should not be seen as special treatment. As differences exist naturally, it is no one’s fault that people are different and neither is being different a fault.
People will also need to overcome the selfishness of wanting everything to be the same like them. I know that I have the same wish, as I am fond of science fictional stuff, retrofuturism, and out of this world stuff, and I do wish I had friends with the same exact tastes. However, I understand that there are no such persons and I have to adjust to that and this nuanced world. I will keep my own tastes and resist other peoples’ efforts to alter my tastes to their desire, but I won’t try to alter theirs as well. We will have to live with our differences.
Other people would say, catering to different needs instead of making all people being the same in order to simplify the meeting of needs is a stupid, unrealistic, and logistically nightmarish ideal that’s even offensive! But take note: this is the ideal, it represents something to work towards while recognizing that we cannot perfectly achieve it. I would also argue that meeting many different wants and needs was better fulfilled by the free market (which Communists gave the strawman term Capitalism), rather than central control that seeks to make everyone the same and put them under dictatorial control.
Thanks for bearing with this rant. While I will admit that this may not be the ultimate answer to world peace, I will point out that nothing will be since humans will always be imperfect. However, to make a bit of “impact” on the world, I believe that the more people accept the reality and necessity of differences, the easier it will be to avoid conflict. We can at least get closer to peace with the reduction or elimination of sameness insistence.",Others
"Rather than complain about the government COVID-19 lockdown, Filipinos should learn to be RESOURCEFUL",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/04/rather-than-complain-about-the-government-covid-19-lockdown-filipinos-should-learn-to-be-resourceful/,"So-called “political analyst” Antonio Contreras’s position on the matter of the ongoing impact of the government’s lockdown on Filipino lives fails to take into account an inconvenient reality of modern society — personal accountability.
Sa gobyerno. Kung ayaw niyong lumabas ang tao, kayo ang magbigay ng mga sumusunod na serbisyo:
•Mamalengke at mag-grocery para sa amin
•Bumili ng gamot namin
•Mag-withdraw para sa amin
•Magpadala ng pera o kumuha ng pera sa LBC, Palawan, Western Union at mga iba pang padala centers
•Magbayad ng mga bills namin.
•Magdeliver sa amin ng mga orders namin
•Umayos ng mga sira sa bahay namin
•Magpainit sa araw sa apo ko pag umaga
•Atbp.
Kayanin kaya?
E sa pagdeliver nga ng relief goods, hindi pa maayos.
Should we be taking the “professor’s” post seriously? This is essentially a spoilt brat response to what are measures implemented for the common good. To be fair to Contreras, he offers his proposed solution. The trouble is, his solution is one that requires that the government do all the thinking. He is essentially saying that Filipinos ought to just sit on their asses and wait for the government to help them.
This is precisely the sort of attitude that is behind Filipinos’ beholdenness to “heroes” and the “salvation” theology preached by their state religion. It is the very kind of ingrained thinking that creates influential demagogues and gets unqualified leaders elected in the Philippines. When you have a citizenry conditioned by their “thought leaders” to feel entitled to government “help”, crafting an entire campaign platform based on empty promises works like a charm every election time.
This Juan Tamad and mentality (also referred to as the infamous palamunin culture Filipinos are renowned for) is at the core of what impoverishes Filipinos to this day — in mind, spirit, and, of course, finances. Contrary to what generations of Filipinos are taught, money does grow on trees. You just need to know what kind of tree to plant and actually get off your ass and plant it to begin with.
People like Contreras miss the opportunity staring everyone in the face here. There are business opportunities for new products and services whenever things change. Most basic of all is that people can once again revisit the lost science of backyard agriculture, for example. Indeed, Philippine society remains a fundamentally agrarian one. Unfortunately, “globalisation” had basically turned Filipinos into farmers dressed in scientists’ robes. They look like modern people on the outside but remain subsistence cultivators on the inside.
Such a society struggles to draw a line differentiating god figures from civil servants. This is why the dishonest rhetoric of their “thought leaders” resonate — because most of them play in that easy space that validates such primitive thinking. It is also why hollow figures like Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto make headline news and attract a vast fan base of starstruck ignoramuses.
Filipinos need to get a grip and focus on sorting themselves out rather than spend their days looking up with gaping mouths waiting for the proverbial guava fruit to drop from the sky. That goes to say whether in times of COVID-19 pandemic or in times of abundance. It’s time Filipinos learn to be independent and turn their back on their debilitating colonial, palamunin, and squatter mentalities.",Others
Why Filipinos are More Enamored with America than with China,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/06/why-filipinos-are-more-enamored-with-america-than-with-china/,"It was reported that the Chinese Embassy in Manila has accused the United States (US) of stoking tensions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). Chinese Embassy officials further claimed that the US is doing this to advance its own geopolitical interest in the region. Of course, right on cue, Duterte sycophants, who are likened to a bunch of Beijing Kool-Aid drinkers, have marched to the drumbeat of the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo. So many articles and blogs are being disseminated by these Duterte worshippers that even Stevie Wonder could see their effort in shifting the narrative from Chinese aggression and encroachment of our territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to the “White American bad boys promoting their self-interest at Filipino expense” from a mile away. Such nonsense idea that the whole conflict is merely about America’s “Proxy War” against China seems so glaringly obvious to favor the Chinese position (besides being factually and historically wrong). For a while I thought these Duterte worshippers were just being useful idiots. Now I realize that they are just plain idiots. However, despite going on overdrive with their pro-China messaging, Filipinos still trust the US the most when it comes to the WPS issue, among other things. China, on the other hand, is dead last when it comes to being trusted by Filipinos. Where might this awe of America over China be coming from despite America having lost to China when it comes to military and economic strength, as Davao blowhard, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (FPRRD) said?
I am not going to repeat my critique of the Duterte sycophants’ claptrap. I believe that I have already pointed out many flaws in their propaganda and the intellectual bankruptcy of the Chinese Brown-nosing Policy that their fentanyl-dosed deity seems to be championing. What I would like to dwell on are probable reasons why Filipinos still have a higher regard for America compared to China. Afterall, data shows that the US has the highest number of emigrants from the Philippines while China’s numbers don’t even appear on the radar when it comes to places Filipinos choose to move to. If Americans are so evil and dumb as what the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers seem to be pontificating, why do Filipinos choose to pursue the American dream over the promise of Chinese luck and prosperity? Why do Filipinos still seem to trust gas station sushi more than China?
Don’t get me wrong, I do not intend to minimize China or its contribution to our country. Afterall, how else can I afford to buy a matching Louis Vuitton belt and a pair of loafers for five bucks? How else can our beloved FPRRD continue (pain-free) with his incoherent rants against President Bongbong Marcos (PBBM) and America without China’s role in making sure fentanyl supply is flowing like the Niagara Falls? So, shouldn’t China’s great contributions and values be looked at more favorably than those dumb knuckle-headed fascist “American Imperialists”? What makes America so great in the eyes of the Filipinos? Let’s assess these Yankee characteristics, in terms of military strength, economic status, (scientific) intelligence, and cultural impact, shall we?
Military
Throughout history there have been a few countries that have dominated the world in terms of military strength. There was Egypt, Rome, the Mongols, Spain, France, Britain, and others. Presently, America has the most powerful military in the world. What separates America, especially in recent history, is its magnanimity after defeating its enemies. American military greatness is not just evident in its firepower but also in terms of its use of power. Case in point, after defeating Nazi Germany and after levelling Japan, America helped rebuild those countries. After World War 2, America’s military force remained intact as it had the most battle-hardened navy the world has ever seen, it possessed sky darkening clouds of B-29 bombers, and it possessed alone (at that time) the atomic bomb and the will to use it. The world was still licking its wounds from the war in 1945 and America could have conquered any recovering country in the world back then had it been the same as any other military superpower throughout history. But what did America do with the once in a lifetime military advantage it had? America actually scrapped many of its naval ships, drove steel bars through the wings of their B29 bombers and began the largest demilitarization process in the history of the world. It also sent billions of 1940s dollars (through the Marshall Plan) to its former mortal enemies to get them back up on their feet. This isn’t just a one-off but actually a pattern. In 1991, the US military routed Iraq and drove them away from Kuwait, a country invaded by then Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. America could have taken the oil but what did it do? America helped Kuwait put out the fires that Saddam Hussein caused and went back home. Throughout the decades after World War 2, America has only gone to war in response to aggression and not to conquer or subjugate other countries (even though it could have).  On occasion the United States intervened in other countries like Grenada or Haiti or Bosnia, but it never stayed to rule those countries. Now what about China’s history of invasion? Did any Duterte sycophants ever fact-check Chinese Communist Party spokesperson Mao Ning for her claim that China has never invaded any country? Yeah, not holding my breath on that one. If China cannot be trusted for its whitewashing of its blemished history in terms of military aggression and invasion, can we really blame the Filipinos for distrusting the Chinese when it comes to respecting our sovereignty and sovereign rights?
Economics
America, by far, remains the largest economy in the world with $28.8 trillion US dollars in GDP and $85,370 in GDP per capita. The runner-up, being China, has $18.5 trillion US dollars in GDP and $13,400 in GDP per capita. Interestingly enough, America has 332 million people compared to China’s population of 1.4 billion people. Since the world’s population is roughly 7.9 billion, it is interesting to point out that despite America only having around 4% of the world’s population compared to China having around 18% of the world’s population, America still produces more than 1.5 times the GDP of second place China even with just a little more than 23% of China’s population. Sure, things like Lebron Nike shoes or Apple iPhones may be manufactured in China but the ideas to create such money-making products still come from America. In fact, America has been on top of the innovation age in recent history. There have been about three waves of innovation ages since recorded history. There’s the agricultural age, the industrial age, and now we have the Information Age. During the 19th century America became the world’s largest grain exporter. During the late 1880s to the early 1900s, America became the world’s leading industrial nation. Now in the Information Age, America leads the world in terms of global information and communication technology market share. Sure, your laptop or your iPhone may very well be manufactured in China, but it is still America who keeps most of the money. It is worthwhile to point out that it actually is where ideas come from that is important and that many of the innovative ideas that propel the world’s economy primarily comes from America. Is there really anything new that comes from China or are they just good in stealing technology and reverse engineering American innovation? I’ll leave that question for my readers to discuss. What is important to point out is that America is not just economically massive, but it is economically nimble as well. Filipinos often migrate to other countries for a better life. Given America’s economic success borne out of its creativity, innovation, and economic nimbleness, is it any wonder why America’s grass looks greener than the shrubs of China’s Gobi Desert?
(Scientific) Intelligence
So how many times have we heard that Americans are dumb? Social media certainly is replete with Americans deserving of the Darwin Award. We have American kids being shown on TikTok being clueless on what year the War of 1812 was, which state the State of Utah is in, or how many states make up the USA. But is it really true that Americans are stupid, and the Chinese are far more intellectually superior? So let us do a comparison of scientific output and impact of the two countries. America still leads the world in terms of the volume of scientific publications produced. The metrics remain consistent in terms of citable documents, citations, and if we look at citations per document China does not even come close to America’s numbers. Why is this information significant? We have to realize that each year, scientists around the world write research papers and these papers produce scientific citations which is tantamount to a measure of how much groundbreaking science is being performed and produced. From 1996 to 2023, America had more than 515 million citations whereas China only had 145 million. This means that America had more than 3.5 times as many as the country that the Duterte supporters glorify. Is this just me being an America worshipper? Maybe that is the case if there were no empirical evidence basis to support my argument. Unfortunately for the Duterte Kool-Aid drinkers, the numbers are there for everyone to see. America, by far, still trounces China in terms of scientific intelligence and America is beating China’s butt even with just around 4% of the world’s population and only 23% of China’s. Even just looking at inventions, America is the hub of all innovative inventions as most new technology was invented in America. Just by comparing the numbers of patent grants alone from 1980 to 2022, America has received a total of 6,184,653 while China received 4,570,636. Wow! It sure looks like a rude awakening for the Duterte worshippers to see that the country they worship is actually scientifically inferior to the “nation of idiots” they love to bash and vilify.
Cultural Impact
In terms of cultural impact let us look at the comparison of the highest grossing movies of all time. Data shows that America, by far, has produced the most in terms of highest grossing films. In fact, most of the movies (if not all) in the Top 50 were produced in America. The highest grossing movie of all time in China, “The Battle of Lake Changjin”, did not even appear on the World’s Top 50 list. In terms of music, America still holds the most number of albums sold in the world with Michael Jackson lording it over the musical world.
I am not, by any means, discounting the talents of people outside of America. There certainly are a lot of people with amazing talent all over the world and China certainly has no shortage of talent. However, the most successful products that came from amazing talents mostly came from American production. Jay Chou, is the all-time king of Chinese music record sales, yet his most successful album does not even appear on the world’s all-time top list. Empirically speaking, America still tops the list of countries that have the most impact in international popular culture. Remember, such cultural impact to the world with America having just around 4% of the world’s population compared to China’s 18%.
Look, let us not unnecessarily stretch this any further, although we could as it is so much fun bursting the Duterte pro-China bubble. The point is that it is not surprising why Filipinos generally still look more favorably towards Americans and America compared to the Chinese and China. Am I merely drinking the American Kool-Aid here? Perhaps. However, the numbers actually do show that America still seems to dominate China in aspects that are a lot worthy of awe and respect. We have not even touched on the current geopolitical turmoil between China and the Philippines yet. A study by Mark Gabriel Wagan Aguilar reveals that the primary drivers for Filipino distrust towards China point to the perceived Chinese threat, their displayed aggressiveness, and superiority complex. But that is for another day to discuss.",Others
Super Bowl Monday Why It Might Be Fun Even For You,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/super-bowl-monday-why-it-might-be-fun-even-for-you/,"It  is a weird premise: early Monday morning party with the possibility of beer. Now how could  it  be fun even if one could care less about the NFL?
Food and Drink Really Early
My friend Alan and I have been going or attempting to go to Super Bowl viewing events in Manila since around 2005/ 2006. At some point during the game we order beer and wings. Some places will have a buffet . Some  places will  just serve their regular menu. These places will usually have something for every one. Even draft beer at 7 AM.  Warning : you know it is a crucial moment in the game because the waitress is more likely to ask you  if you want one more.
Unique Atmosphere
The United States has the best professional basketball, hockey and baseball in the world . Yet the interest in those sports ( based on US TV ratings)  is dwarfed by the interest in the NFL. A sport that has no significant corresponding league overseas.  In 2024,  of the top 15 most widely viewed programs in the US – 13 were NFL games. The other two were the Oscars and the Biden- Trump debate.
The good thing about watching the Super Bowl in an Asian country is people care but not too much. There will be cheering and yelling during certain events plus liquor is served. What I have never seen is people who are  so passionate about a team that arguments erupt or even worse. Some places will have promos . Prizes I won over the years include a Philadelphia Eagles cap that I won in 2006 that I still wear today and an ESPN 5 shirt .
Goes without saying that the Super Bowl is big in the US. People love football . It is an honor for the teams to play in it, the announcers to call it , the cities who host it and even the musical performers who play during halftime.  In Philippines even the guys let alone the females don’t know the difference between the punt and field goal. They however will mention that the only thing they know about  the Super Bowl is the halftime show.  The ones I talk to assume that the halftime show is why the Super Bowl is successful. Why not? They heard about the musical acts playing and they only watch games with a shot clock.  They are of course wrong. The tail does not wag the dog. First of all review that stat I gave you earlier about the Top 15 TV events in 2024.   I hate to bring logic and empirical evidence is an a piece about passion but how about this nugget? The halftime performers in the Super Bowl do not get paid. They get promoted in a way that they never have been promoted and never will be promoted. The performers want the Super Bowl more than the game wants them.
“I am not a morning person. Except the second Monday in February. “
Best Commercials In One Place
YouTube has demystified commercials that are done better than  ones we find locally in the Philippines.   Last year it cost $7 million  to air  one 30 second commercial .
To put that   in perspective. The PBA in 2022 earned a record income of $3.5 million
Normally commercials during a game are a good time to go the bathroom at your friendly neighborhood pub. You have no idea what you will miss when you leave for the can during the Super Bowl. I seem to remember hosting a few friends decades ago making club sandwiches and this came on during the pregame.  I remember this cute Volkswagen ad. ( Google their founder)  This commercial is even more epic considering the foreshadowing of what happened with a certain celeb couple.
John Keating  (Robin Williams ) said “the human race is filled with passion“.     What is strange is that in a country where the general population only knows a team sport with a round orange ball, I see that passion every year on a Monday morning in February. You get to witness that passion at a sports bar near you  Feb 10 , 2025 . Show up with a  football literate friend or two and learn some new things and maybe have more fun that you ever thought a Monday morning could be.",Others

Do Filipino brains lack an engineering chip?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/01/do-filipino-brains-lack-an-engineering-chip/,"Everywhere you look — physically or conceptually — in the Philippines and you find systems and solutions that cannot scale. The most famous of these is the jeepney. The jeepney “system” (if you can even call it a system) is a public transport solution that requires more labour input with every unit of capacity expansion. This is why as the populations of the Philippines’ cities ballooned to their enormous sizes today, so too did their jeepney infestations.
The same can be said about the country’s economy. It is a predominantly labour-added value and consumption-driven one. It needs disproportionately more warm bodies to churn out every additional unit of the low-value commodities the Philippines is renowned for. It also needs more people to keep spending to prop up the consumption pyramid scheme.
Worse, aside from being labour-intensive, the Philippine economy is also extractive. It relies on stuff being dug out of the earth and pulled out of women’s wombs for much of its exports. Because these economic models are such strong traditions, the Philippines’ crooked politicians know nothing beyond extracting their wealth in similar fashion to fund their worth — pretending to be “concerned about the poor” (the greatest political resource of all) while colluding with one another to channel the fruits of labour export, mining, and mall development into their secret bank accounts.
Why can’t Filipinos’ spot this pattern and act on the insight in said patterns? Perhaps it is because they are inherently incapable of wrapping their pointed heads around the bigger scheme of things. Systemic thinking necessarily requires broad cognitive vision — perhaps a mental skill that decades of habitual small-mindedness had irrevocably atrophied in the Philippines. One, after all, needs a strong grasp of large scale systems in order to take a long view on cause-and-effect relationships.
Engineering is, at its core, the systematic study and modelling of cause-and-effect. In this definition lies the answer to why Filipinos fail to innovate at every corner of their collective history. Much of what hampers Philippine progress begs engineering solutions — turning input into greater output at scale. Because Filipinos aren’t engineers they are, perhaps, doomed to forever fail at what is, essentially, the ultimate source of per capita wealth growth.",Others
Compliment Addiction and Making Everyone “Girly:” Why Current Feminism Fails,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/04/compliment-addiction-feminism-fail/,"The Blue Origin NS-31 space flight that included singer Katy Perry has recently been the topic of mockery on the Internet. Feminists are hailing it as the next major milestone for women since Valentina Tereshkova’s historic mission in 1963. They may also say that it is the women’s right since they have the money for it and we “peasants” are just jealous. However, I agree with critics pointing out that the “crew” were actually just passengers on an automated flight that was funded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos – making it just another rich man’s hobby toy and 10-minute rich girls’ “road” trip. It’s just as hyped as movie star weddings.
Aside from the over-hype, I think it brought along some toxic feminism among the defense. If you don’t praise the women involved or acknowledge their “astronautness,” you are a bigot or misogynist (I might be called one for writing this article after all). Something from the communist playbook.
“Girly-Group” Behavior
I’m also thinking the “girls’ complimenting each other” habit that I mentioned in my Social Media Likes article contributes to the toxicity. I thought that this tendency is something that should stay within girls’ circles; don’t let it get to males. Now I realize that it already has been in males… and many other groups, such as the LGBT+ movement. They make compliment-giving and positive affirmation requirements for others and try to “cancel” anyone who doesn’t comply, even if compliments and affirmation are undeserved. As long as compliment-seeking becomes an obsession in any group or gender, bloated egos, unreasonableness, and toxicity spread.
“Women’s Logic”
Perhaps it’s just the so-called “women’s logic.” Of course, it is a stereotype of illogic (should it be “women’s illogic?”) and even men can have it. When women are angry while illogical, the Filipino word for it is “toyo” or soy sauce; in American pop culture, it’s the ”karen.” As a married friend said, some women seem wired to whine. Being a scale modeler with other hobbies, I have heard of women partners angrily demanding that their men stop their hobbies and just pour all the money on them. That’s somewhat like the pokpoks in this country seeking to leech rich foreign visitors of their money.
Some have probably heard of the joke where a woman in an airplane complained about the window in the plane’s bathroom, fearing that someone will be peeping at her from outside. At least it was another woman, a flight attendant, who retorted that at this altitude, if someone is peeping at you, they deserve to see everything! Gives me the impression that women are more likely to believe fanciful magical thinking like The Secret and Manifesting (or at times, it could be schizophrenia or other mental conditions, leading to loss of touch with reality).
This may be a personal gripe, but I don’t like it when mothers sometimes take some of their children’s clothes and other belongings and give it to other people without the children’s knowledge. Also, I remember when I was told to give off my old phone to a family member rather than sell it off. Problem is, that encourages mendicancy. That makes me theorize that socialist ideas actually started in families where the mom or other family member is a whimsical “redistributor.”
We Compliment-Fishers Must Rule!
I think the “girls’ complimenting attitude” gives the illusion that women are better than men, so they want to rule over society. Of course, this is a theory on one of the real drivers behind feminism as well as Wokeness. When they don’t succeed in their takeovers, they lash out with their “bigot” and “despot” namecalling.
So if compliment-fishers think they are better than men or others, they will only accept others who are like themselves and hate those are unlike them. This might also fuel the claim that if everyone were more like women, the world would be more peaceful. Yeah, right, as if thinking you are better than others isn’t toxic itself. I have heard that some females can be worse than males when they become abusive while in power. It may be a moot topic, but it’s a lie to say females have no toxicity.
Do Easy times Create Weak People?
I surmised that one reason for the idea of “women’s illogic” is the female culture (as well as culture of the youth) that developed after World War 2. With the end of the war, women were no longer needed in factories and other lines of work where they used to be mainstays. This meant that they stay home most of the time as housewives. They had more idle time to gather with other wives and gossip (like in ancient times, creating “Old Wives’ Tales”). Further fueling the potential for misinformation was mass media in the form of radio and television, which gave them topics to gossip on, including celebrity worship. This spreads to other members of the family (even the men at work).
Advertising and marketing teach women to focus on vanity, appearance, and self-aggrandizement, and this later spread to men. Celebrity worship culture (i.e. Katy Perry and the other women on this flight) was built up in order to facilitate the consumerism. The marketing messages also encourage treating anyone not following the trend as “out.” Some people who are anti-racist or against discrimination seem to fail at criticizing discrimination of the “untrendy.”
Also, the recent fiasco on the live action Snow White movie reminds me of how some people today could be called Disney Princesses, spoiled people expecting to be treated like princesses. As the princesses are the main characters of the story and are spoiled by their “Prince Charmings,” the young people develop main character syndrome and become as obnoxious as Rachel Zegler was during her notorious “promotion” of her movie.
Conclusion
My suggestion that people (not just “girls”) should overcome the compliment-seeking habit and stop seeking such as entitlements (or stop seeking any entitlement at all) is more likely be slammed as “sexist hate speech.” But feminists and their ilk have to understand that real peace is obtained by being tolerant of even what seems offensive. For example, closed-minded girls often find boys offensive and rude; but they must understand that male traits contribute to the survival of the species.
As esteemed webmaster Benign0 recently wrote, people are so addled by social media that they get trapped in their main character syndrome bubbles, ready to explode if they don’t get enough compliments. Wait… as if that syndrome didn’t infect Filipinos already for years as evidenced by the Pinoy Pride mantra – Filipinos deserve compliments, or else you are Anti-Filipino! That core of Filipino culture will have to change if we want real improvement in our country.",Others
