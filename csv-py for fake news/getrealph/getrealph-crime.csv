Patricia Evangelista’s bullshit published on The @NewYorker,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/10/patricia-evangelistas-bullshit-published-on-the-newyorker/,"The basic problem with Rappler‘s journalists has always been their reportage adheres to the cliché of the “rules-based international order,” which is whatever is the latest dictate in the West about social and moral mores. At the country level, they don’t bother to take into account what the reality is on the ground.
The latest source of high-profile Western “insight” into the situation in the Philippines, however, revolves around former Rapplerette Patricia Evangelista. She, along with her new book Some People Need Killing, are the subjects of a piece published on the New Yorker and authored by David Remnick. Remnick calls Evangelista “a very rare talent” who has “written a journalistic masterpiece”. Basing his views on what he was told by Rappler CEO and Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate Maria Ressa, Remnick writes…
Ressa would surely be the first to say that there would have been no Nobel, and very little truth in the Duterte era, were it not for the meticulous reporting of Evangelista and others like her. Evangelista was on the street every night, surveying the horror, examining the corpses, talking to the grieving families, and prodding the police. She wrote news pieces, and she wrote longer investigations.
…or so he and many of us keep being told.
Ask any average Filipino if they thought the drug problem of the country in 2016 was serious or not and their answer would be yes. I saw it for myself and several of my friends had close kin who had drug problems, particularly ones involving shabu. I had verified information also that several officials of the administration of the late former President Benigno Aquino III were protectors of drug lords. It was why the problem was prevalent and most or the majority of the barangays had to contend with it.
Evangelista writes about impunity but she fails to take into account the bigger picture; the menace to society and what effect it had on the victims of heinous crimes as a direct effect of the problem and that of the drug addicts and pushers families themselves. More laughable is how Evangelista claims that she had to move to New York because her life was in danger.
Now, how long has it been since you left the Philippines?
A few months, give or take. It was recommended that it was in my best interests.
What does that mean?
It means we don’t know the risk of my having released this book. There was a security assessment, and the assessment was, Get the fuck out.
And do you think you’ll go back?
Yes, absolutely. When I’ll go back is not certain, but I have to go back. It’s not moral patriotism or anything—that’s my home. And the story is ongoing. It’s not over. People are still dying on the streets. Journalists have been shot in Manila. And there are many other stories that have to be told about my country. I am a field reporter; that’s where I belong.
Bullshit. Evangelista’s mother is the sister of a good friend of mine. Their ancestral home is in Heroes Hills QC. No journalists, who were staunch critics of former President Rodrigo Duterte, were killed during his six-year term. It’s common knowledge that cRappler is funded by American liberal interest groups and the CIA front organizations as well. The very people who are against Duterte can hardly be called Filipinos because they don’t think and act like the typical Filipino. Maria Ressa herself is an interloper because the Philippines allows her to have dual citizenship.
Patricia Evangelista didn’t move to New York because of death threats. She moved to New York because that’s been her lifelong dream; to be an American and move in the intellectual and literary circles of the journalistic elite in America.",Others
Leila De Lima is the new martyr-saint of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/leila-de-lima-is-the-new-martyr-saint-of-the-yellowtard-communist-axis/,"“Maintenance cost for a now defunct alliance…” These are the words used by noted Inquirer columnist Manuel L Quezon III in his latest piece to regard the detention of former Senator Leila De Lima as the “cost” of the political alliance of the Marcoses, Dutertes and former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the leadup to the massive electoral defeat of the Yellowtards in the 2022 national elections.
Of this detention, MLQ3 writes…
The time stolen from De Lima was stolen from the Filipino people, too. It deprived not only those who voted for her, but the entire national constituency that elects senator, of representation. It likely robbed her of a second term, as well, as she took a reputational hit from the attacks mounted by former president Rodrigo Duterte and his entire infrastructure.
Were the Filipinos who voted for De Lima in 2016 robbed as MLQ3 claims? Start with the facts. De Lima didn’t almost make it into the Senate in that election. The margin between her and then candidate and former chief of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Francis Tolentino was narrow enough for Tolentino to file allegations of electoral fraud against De Lima. This puts a bit of a reality check on the idea that De Lima was a leading opposition or personality at the time.
The more important unanswered question, however, is this: Did De Lima have enough evidence against former President Rodrigo Duterte on her charges of human rights offenses? If she did, why didn’t she file a case against him when she was still chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR)? It was quite obvious that De Lima was tasked with the demolition job on the then president, hitting the ground running just as soon as the Senate began sessions after her proclamation. The narrative was from an old playbook which was used to oust former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada in 2000. They thought it would work against Duterte, another plurality president, since they successfully applied this approach against Erap, who swept De Venecia in 1998.
If De Lima was abandoned by her peers, then that’s just how politics is in this country as it is Duterte’s turn to be marginalized. Filipinos have notoriously short memories seeing how there are only few who mention the preponderance of even circumstantial evidence against De Lima which showed her partying  with notorious drug lords inside the Bilibid compound and her admission of her frailties by indulging in an affair with her driver who was married which, going by the revised penal code, is an act of adultery punishable not only by the penal provision but also disbarment for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar. Is she not guilty of this act as well even with her admission?
The Yellowidiots have always been practitioners of the double standard. De Lima is now being “martyrized” like the late former senator and “national hero”  Ninoy Aquino before her. She’s also being sanctified like former President Cory Aquino. The other question is, did her being granted bail come with a quid pro quo from the Americans and Europeans who have been clamoring for her release from “unjust” detention? Did the Marcos administration give in to the wishes of the “rules-based international order” in exchange for its continuing validation as a friend, partner and ally?",Others
Leila De Lima threatens to sue former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Will she succeed?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/11/leila-de-lima-threatens-to-sue-former-philippine-president-rodrigo-duterte-will-she-succeed/,"Former Senator Leila De Lima, newly released on bail and now surrounded by Yellowtards, priests, and “journalists” is locked and loaded. “It’s reckoning time,” she reportedly crows — a battle cry made today’s top headline by no less than the Inquirer.
But of course, right?
But how much credibility as a practitioner of law does De Lima wield? This is someone, after all who seems to bow more to a foreign “court” than to the authority of the Supreme Court of her own country. This is evident in how, even today, she makes the International Criminal Court (ICC) a pillar of her threats against former President Rodrigo Duterte.
She also scoffed at the former president’s remarks against her after she voiced her support for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC).
ICC is investigating the previous administration’s campaign against illegal drugs.
Duterte previously said de Lima can “go together” with ICC, as he tossed the matter aside.
In reaction, de Lima asked, “Am I a human rights violator? Am I a killer, let alone a mass murderer?”
“Siguro ang ibig sabihin lang niyang ‘magsama-sama’ ay gusto lang niyang may makasama siya in that lonely cell at ICC,” she said in jest.
(Maybe what he means by ‘go together’ is that he wants someone to go with him in that lonely cell at ICC.)
Indeed, back in 2019, De Lima exhibited behaviour unbecoming of an officer of the judiciary which could even be regarded as grounds for disbarment. De Lima at the time had counted on an initiative being mounted by the US government back then to coerce the Philippines into releasing her from detention by banning Filipinos seen to be instrumental in her detention.
Think about it for a moment. The US is implementing a measure to ban Philippine government officials on the basis of someone’s opinion that they had “persecuted” Philippine Senator Leila De Lima. This is a position taken regardless of what any Filipino court has so far ruled. It just shows how, to Americans, the Philippines still remains a quaint little colonial outpost.
The Philippines’ Supreme Court at the time upheld a June 2018 ruling on De Lima’s arrest and detention on drug charges…
The high court denied “with finality” De Lima’s motion for reconsideration and said it would no longer entertain future pleadings or motions.
“…No substantial arguments were presented to warrant the reversal of the questioned decision,” the court said in a notice.
The Yellowtard-Communist Axis that make up much of the Philippines’ so-called “Opposition” nonetheless continue to make the ICC intervention into domestic affairs a pillar of their ideology. Old habits die hard and the Philippines today remains a laughingstock of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — the only country in the region that lacks an indigenous conviction robust enough to get over a historic fixation on its “victimisation” by former colonial masters. Today its “thought leaders” remain locked in quaint “debate” over which global power to cling to — United States or China — as camps use local politicians as proxies to organise themselves into polar cults of personality and loyalty to the day’s global hegemons; the administration of current President Bongbong representing the influence of Uncle Sam and the Duterte clan representing that of the People’s Republic of China.
Where does the influence of an independent Philippines fit in this picture? Well, what exactly these “thought leaders” mean when they drop the term “independence” is the subject of yet another idiotic Filipino-style “debate”. So let’s not hold our breath waiting for an answer to that last question.",Others
"Red tagging is not a crime. Communist genocide, on the other hand, is.",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/red-tagging-is-not-a-crime-communist-genocide-on-the-other-hand-is/,"It’s just a tag just as “reactionary” is a term used by communists to label their enemies. Imagine for a minute a future where the communists had successfully mounted their violent “people’s revolution” and installed their “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Why, the first thing these crooks would do is hunt down these “reactionaries”, drag them from the nice houses they built with their hard-earned money and put them in front of firing squads.
This is exactly what the commies did in Cambodia. The communist party of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge, went on a massive killing spree that resulted in the deaths of millions of “reactionaries”. So bad was this massacre that Cambodian journalist Dith Pran coined the term “killing fields” to describe the thousands of mass grave sites that were used to bury the victims of this “revolution”.
Mr. Dith saw his country descend into a living hell as he scraped and scrambled to survive the barbarous revolutionary regime of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, when as many as two million Cambodians — a third of the population — were killed, experts estimate. Mr. Dith survived through nimbleness, guile and sheer desperation. His credo: Make no move unless there was a 50-50 chance of not being killed.
Back then, and in many other parts of the world that they infested, communists engaged in the very same activity they claim to be victims of today. Their rabid supporters merely pointed a finger at a person they summarily deemed a “reactionary” and their respective Gestapos took it from there. The very same “revolution” is being mounted by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) through its terrorist group, the New People’s Army (NPA). In an interview published in Esquire magazine in 2017, the late founder of the CPP-NPA, Jose Maria “Joma” Sison, articulated his vision of the armed revolution his people are waging…
The people’s war answers the central question of revolution, which is to seize power. Even before nationwide seizure of power, local organs of the people’s democratic government are already being established to displace the reactionary government. Socio-economic revolution is going on through genuine land reform, promoting cooperative production and favoring Filipino-owned industries. The cultural revolution is going on. It is advancing the cause of a national, scientific and people-serving cultural and educational system. Revolutionary educators, writers and artists, scientists, and technologists and other cultural workers and the great mass of activists of the national democratic movement are waging a cultural revolution.
As recently as 2020, the then soon-to-croak founder of the Party described the nefarious objectives of the NPA…
Combatants are rotated so that everyone has combat experience and contribue to the drive for increasing the arms of the NPA by launching tactical offensives to wipe out enemy units. The long-running plan of the CPP is to raise the armed strength of the NPA from 10,000 high-powered rifles to 25,000 in order to reach the strategic stalemate and launch tactical offensives with companies and battalions.
The key difference is that, today, the Philippines is a democracy with a functioning criminal justice system and a civilian police force. Any political camp is free to label the other something — “Yellowtard”, “Dutertard”, “DDS”, “Lenitard”, “fascist”, bayaran, “troll”, and, yes, “communist”. It’s no different to how other woke communities like feminists and “gay rights” activists come up with all sorts of terms to categorise people based on their sexual orientation and reproductive equipment (whether natural or artificial). It’s just part of the human condition, the human mind being a wondrously complex classification engine and our species being one that is tribal at its cultural core.
Communist “activists” make it sound as if they are a special class of people — one that is exempt from being labelled and tagged. Thus, they now come up with the idiotic notion that being “red tagged” is a crime. Well, all we can really say to these “special” people is this: Welcome to the club. There is nothing special about being a communist.",Others
Leila De Lima’s acquittal ultimately counts for nothing for the Philippine Opposition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/leila-de-limas-acquittal-ultimately-counts-for-nothing-for-the-philippine-opposition/,"“Thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition are once again doing the Dance of Joy over what they see as their latest “win” against the “Forces of Darkness”. That, of course, is on the assumption that the Opposition led by the Yellowtard-Communist Axis are the “good” in a “fight” versus “evil”.
After spending more than half a decade in jail on charges of drug trafficking, this recent acquittal of a charge that she received money from drug traffickers is just the second of three cases filed against former Senator Leila De Lima. This means De Lima will continue to remain imprisoned pending the outcome of the third. The Opposition, as expected, are making this all about “long overdue justice” finally being served. They put this within the context of their insistence that De Lima was a “victim” of persecution perpetrated by the government of former President Rodrigo Duterte who, they say, was behind what they describe as “trumped up charges” levied against De Lima for being critical of his government.
In doing so, the Opposition are of the belief that “bad” things happen to “good” people like De Lima because of “bad” presidents. One wonders then whether if they now believe that a “good” president is behind this “good outcome” for said “good” person — which brings us to an important point. The bottom-line question here is whether or not a good outcome for De Lima will score political points for the Opposition. After all, a camp that went to lengths to politicise the “plight” of a person they painted as a “victim” would expect a return on that investment, right?
Unfortunately, De Lima — an Opposition “asset” that had seen better days — will likely not contribute much to the already scant political capital that the Opposition hope to apply to their goal of winning an election any time soon. The problems of the Opposition lie far deeper than the scarcity of able leaders they had long suffered. While confronting evidence that their efforts to win the 2022 elections failed because of the profound incompetence of their campaign stares them in the face, the Opposition has so far exhibited an inability to learn important lessons from that experience. De Lima herself whose “victimhood” was fodder for this dysfunctional campaign was part of the very collateral that failed to deliver results to the Yellowtard-Communist Axis in that last “important” election.
What new fodder for the ongoing power grab the Opposition continues to mount against the government could be squeezed out of the De Lima circus is anyone’s guess. The “Human Rights” Card has already been overplayed for decades and the dismal showing of the Opposition in the last election should have been a wake up call to them to apply a bit more creativity, original thinking, and listening skills to their messaging. Sadly for the Philippine Opposition and the Yellowtard-Communist Axis that presumes to lead it, it seems their severe learning disability will persist over the foreseeable future.",Others
Send the Army back to Marawi City!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/send-the-army-back-to-marawi-city/,"And so it starts again. Rising criminality and emboldened terrorists. They are an ominous sign that bandits that kept their heads down at a time when the Philippine Government was willing to shoot people to keep the peace are now back in the game.
The recent terrorist attack that saw at least three innocent people killed in Marawi City may, unfortunately, be just the first. Three people died and seven were hurt after a blast reportedly occurred at the Dimaporo Gymnasium in Mindanao State University (MSU) in Marawi City Sunday morning.
The blast occurred at 7:30 a.m. as a Mass was being held at the gym attended by students and teachers, according to a report by GMA Integrated News stringer Ferdinandh Cabrera on Super Radyo dzBB.
The emergency room at the regional hospital in Marawi City has been placed on code blue as a result.
Investigation is ongoing regarding the incident.
Marawi City, we recall, was, in recent years, the site of a fierce battle between Philippine Government forces and Islamic terrorists that the city had been host to for years. The battle involved one of the biggest mobilisations of military resources in recent Philippine history and, in the aftermath of the fighting, the city was left utterly destroyed. Nonetheless, it seems criminal elements there are back with a vengeance. Perhaps they need to be given a reminder of why doing bad things does not pay.
The Philippine Government needs to be more vigilant nowadays. This is, after all, an age when terrorism is openly celebrated around the world what with cheerleaders of Hamas’s terrorism sharing equal bandwidth on traditional media with those who fight them. The subtle effects of this tacit tolerance for terrorism in media and amongst “polite” circles cannot be ignored. In the Philippines, terrorists and crooks keep their heads down in times when the Philippine Government exhibits a will to act swiftly, decisively, and with force when peace and order are threatened. The fact they now openly perpetrate their violence on ordinary Filipinos with utter impunity perhaps says something about the perceived character of the government of President Bongbong Marcos.
The first step in dealing with crooks and terrorists usually comes in the form of a message — a strong one. When it comes to elements that speak only one language — violence — there are really few options to evaluate. The clearest message of all is to show that they are out-resourced and outgunned.",Others
“Hunger strikes” are so Last Century,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/hunger-strikes-are-so-last-century/,"Yes, the Mahatma Gandhi did it. But then he was the Mahatma. Will the stunt currently being undertaken by SMNI anchors Lorraine Badoy and Eric Celiz deliver the same public indignation that launched the revolution of the sort that transpired in India that is credited to Gandhi? Very likely not. Will it move those who perpetrated their unjust incarceration to reconsider? Certainly not.
On the contrary, those who contribute to  and support what many claim to be a demolition campaign being mounted against Vice President Inday Sara Duterte are gleefully watching and hoping Badoy’s and Celiz’s “hunger strike” goes through to its natural conclusion. One noted “thought leader”, in fact, quipped, “A person can survive maybe 21-60 days without food so matagal pa”.
The real question is whether Congress actually does possess the authority to detain people. This is an important point in light of people interpreting Badoy’s and Celiz’s “plight” as karma for the situation former Senator Leila De Lima found herself in during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte. De Lima, however, was detained on orders of a Philippine court. Badoy and Celiz, on the other hand, were detained apparently on the bases of mere whims of legislators who form a congressional inquiry “in aid of legislation”.
The Philippine Star reports further…
Badoy was cited in contempt for flip-flopping on the information she provided the panel regarding the network’s advertisements.
After apologizing for making the allegation against Romualdez, Celiz has asked to take back his apology from the record because he supposedly issued it without legal counsel.
Perhaps, indeed, these are grounds for citing the two in contempt as both had been found to have committed or technically admitted to perjury. For now it remains debatable whether engaging in publicity stunts while in prison helps any “victims” of state power (the legality of the latter being the subject of ongoing “debate” notwithstanding). It certainly didn’t help De Lima or, for that matter, the later former Senator and “national hero” Ninoy Aquino himself who had, since the 1980s, been the inspiration of illustrious copycats.
Indeed, throughout this drama, Badoy’s half sister and noted Yellowtard “thought leader” Gang Badoy sits in the sidelines snickering over her sibling’s “plight”.
Therein this sliver of insight into their internal family dynamics shared by Badoy above lies the irony in this so-called “hunger strike” waged by Badoy and Celiz. If one is not consistent, one opens themselves to scrutiny and derision when one engages in “activism”. It seems Badoy and Celiz had become the very characters they rail against. For what groups, after all, are most renowned for their inconsistency than those that form the Yellowtard-Communist Axis. Even if Badoy gets out of jail before Christmas, it is evident that there will be no Christmas cheer coming from her own family over the holidays.",Others
CPP-NPA should be held to account for war crimes as a condition to any “amnesty”!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/cpp-npa-should-be-held-to-account-for-war-crimes-as-a-condition-to-any-amnesty/,"Are the communists genuine in their efforts to make peace with the Philippine Government? The answer to that question is quite simple. No. Communists have one and only one goal — to overthrow any legitimate government through violent means (what they call their “people’s revolution”) and install their “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Yet, current negotiations between the Philippine Government and officials of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) reportedly aim to “end their armed struggle and transform into a political movement, according to Norway, which has facilitated the South East Asian island nation’s peace process for around 20 years.”
Notable however is this aspect…
Removing the communist party and affiliated groups from a government list of designated terror organizations was included in the talks, government Peace Process Adviser Carlito Galvez told a press conference in Manila.
How convenient for these terrorists. It remains important that the CPP be held to account for the actions of its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). The NPA is a perpetrator of numerous war crimes. Among these is the use of landmines which is prohibited by the “Ottawa Convention” or “Mine Ban Treaty” that came into effect on 1999.
States-parties commit to not using, developing, producing, acquiring, retaining, stockpiling, or transferring anti-personnel landmines, which are defined by the treaty as mines “designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more persons.” APLs that are remotely triggered, such as claymores, is not proscribed, nor are anti-vehicle mines, including those equipped with anti-handling devices, which are designed to protect anti-vehicles mines from being tampered with or moved.  The treaty also forbids signatories from assisting or encouraging any other state or party from engaging in the activities outlawed by the treaty.
The NPA was found to still be using these weapons which had resulted in the tragic deaths of Far Easterner University (FEU) footballer Kieth Absalon and his cousin Nolven Absalon in an explosion in mid-2021. Despite the CPP-NPA taking “full responsibility” for these tragedies, actual consequences for their crimes has not been forthcoming since. Even more disturbing, the tweet in which NPA spokesperson Marco Valbuena issued said apology and admission of responsibility seems to have been deleted (screenshot of deleted tweet exhibited below).
We can see here just how dishonest and duplicitous the CPP-NPA are. They cannot be trusted to be party to any sort of “peace agreement”. Indeed, Vice President Inday Sara Duterte reportedly described the recent initiative to talk “peace” with these terrorists as one that could result in an “agreement with the devil”.
“Mr. President, the government’s statement with the NDFP in Oslo was an agreement with the devil,” Duterte said in an address streamed on her Facebook page.
“They will use this peace negotiations to betray government and deceive the public.”
History repeats itself yet again as the current administration of President Bongbong Marcos goes down a path the CPP-NPA had long hoped a Philippine government would tread — one that leads to the same sort of trap that killed Absalon, many brave Filipino soldiers, and many ordinary Filipinos going about their day trying to make an honest living.",Others
SMNI should take stock of the lessons that can be learned from the “plights” of ABS-CBN and Rappler,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/12/smni-should-take-stock-of-the-lessons-that-can-be-learned-from-the-plights-of-abs-cbn-and-rappler/,"That Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI) finds itself neck-deep in trouble comes as no surprise. Like its Yellowtard counterpart Rappler, SMNI sprung out of nowhere at a time when the Philippines’ political situation demanded targeted media coverage in aid of certain politicians’ personal agendas. The readily-evident relationships at the top make its intent a foregone conclusion. The head and founder of SMNI is none other than Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, leader of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) and the “spiritual adviser” of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Indeed, SMNI started out as the media arm of KJC with which Qiuiboloy broadcast his televangelist services.
It does not help that Quiboloy is also reportedly wanted in the United States for alleged sexual offenses.
The US Department of Justice said the sex trafficking scheme was organized through Quiboloy’s church, called the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name (KOJC). The operation allegedly ran for 16 years until 2018.
Police arrested three men in the US on Thursday. Quiboloy, however, is still believed to be in Davao City, in the Philippines along with two other suspects named in the indictment.
Known to his six million followers in 200 countries as “The Appointed Son of God,” Quiboloy used a bogus Californian charity to bring the girls and women to the US to work as personal assistants, or “pastorals.”
The women and girls ranged in age from 12 to 25.
More recently, the Philippines’ Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) today reportedly suspended two of SMNI’s programmes, “Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa” (From the Masses, for the Masses) and “Laban Kasama ang Bayan” (Fight Together with the Nation). According to the MTRCB
The MTRCB said complaints were filed against the “Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa” October 10 episode where Duterte aired a death threat against ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro.
The board said it also received another complaint about an alleged death threat and profane language by a guest on the same show on Nov. 15.
The MTRCB said it issued a warning to SMNI that similar incidents will be dealt with more sternly. The TV network committed to pre-record and review episodes before airing.
The program “Laban Kasama ang Bayan” was also brought to the attention of the MTRCB after Celiz claimed on-air that House Speaker Martin Romualdez spent 1.8 billion for travels this year. The host admitted in a House hearing that the information from his Senate source was unverified.
It is interesting then seeing the way members of the Dutertard community are now throwing monumental tantrums over the actions taken by the MTRCB against SMNI. Perhaps people need to first step back, take a deep breath, and get a grip. On the basis of mere perceptions alone, it is evident that SMNI is not being run like anything resembling a professional news media organisation. To be fair to others like Rappler and ABS-CBN News, those two went to great lengths to craft exquisite veneers of legitimacy and at least pretend they were taking a balanced approach to delivering “journalism” to the Filipino people. Rappler even went as far as campaigning aggressively for the Nobel “Peace Prize” that its CEO Maria Ressa proudly sports today.
What are the next steps for the Dutertard community seeing that facts don’t seem to get in the way of their persistent cult-like loyalty to the media arm of the Duterte clan? Perhaps it will do them well to learn from the “plight” of ABS-CBN when it failed to secure renewal of its franchise to broadcast and, following that, mounted a campaign to paint itself as some sort of “victim”, incite disruptive street rallies (to the extent of putting participants at risk of COVID infection), and tap its pool of indentured “talent” to mobilise their fantard communities to back their “cause”.
All that did not work despite the mightiest honchos of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis backing the embattled conglomerate. The fact is, SMNI does not have even a fraction of the manufactured legitimacy and engineered institutional backing enjoyed by ABS-CBN and Rappler in the times both played the “victim”. As always, pana-panahon lang yan. The Philippines lacks a professional civil service and its regulators act more on the behest of the powers-that-be than on any bases that upholds the public interest. The short of it is that those who can’t at least keep their nose clean in the best of times better learn to play the game well in the worst of times.",Others
Assassination attempt on Donald Trump: illiberal means to “save democracy”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/07/assassination-attempt-on-donald-trump-illiberal-means-to-save-democracy/,"Quite confronting that an assassination attempt on a former American president and the Republican candidate in the coming presidential election in the United States could still happen in this day and age. Following shots fired during former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania resulted in the deaths of a member of the audience and the shooter. A seemingly bloodied Trump was seen on video being whisked away by Secret Service personnel. He was reportedly injured in the attack on the “upper part of [his] right ear”. Two other audience member were also reportedly critically injured.
The Secret Service said the shooter fired multiple shots from an “elevated position” outside of the Trump rally before he was killed by agents. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination, according to law enforcement officials.
As expected, content rolled off social media filled with both support for and vitriol against Trump. The campaign of current US President Joe Biden exhibited grace. Reuters reports…
US President Joe Biden said he was briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump’s rally and that he was ‘grateful to hear that he’s safe and doing well. I’m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information’
It does not take a political “expert” to issue an educated guess on how liberals are feeling in the aftermath.
Before all this, it is widely known that the liberal establishment had been mounting a well-funded concerted effort to stop Trump. Noted thought leader Fareed Zakaria in a March op-ed piece published on the Washington Post warned them about going overboard in their quest to “save democracy”…
Liberal democracies should avoid the temptation of using illiberal means, even when they confront views and positions that are forthrightly hostile toward liberal democracy itself. I worry about some of the court cases against Trump. While they might be technically legitimate, some involve offenses that happened years ago and for which he was not charged at the time. Would he have been charged for these were he not the controversial political figure he is today?
Indeed, of the “excesses” of the left, Zakaria further writes, “[they] want to ban those who have ‘wrong’ ideas from speaking. They want to achieve racial equality by quota or decree. They want to use education or art to achieve political goals rather than educational or artistic ones.”
As this is a developing story, it is, of course, prudent to refrain from any further speculation as the investigation on this breaking incident progresses.",Others

It’s been interesting to compare the current Senate investigations into Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) spearheaded by Sen. Risa Hontiveros to the parallel investigation going on in the House which has made a bit of a folk hero of Batangas Rep. Gerville Luistro. The House, to my mind, seems, for once, to be demonstrating some pretty effective teamwork which means there is good coaching going on behind the scenes.
Aficionados of investigations point to the satisfying manner in which police officials, for example, have been asked about their work and the people they deal with, only for the police officials to be confronted, at the end of their testimony, with pictures and videos demolishing the claims they’d just made. Even the manner in which Harry Roque was brought to heel, from being rather pleased with himself to becoming thoroughly entangled in his own evasions and contradictions, was outstanding.
Funny thing is, it’s the judiciary which determines the probity of the evidence and the guilt of the accused. It makes you question what the Senate has turned into, when its primary purpose is legislation. The bete noir of the Yellowidiots couldn’t resist taking a swipe at Sen. Ronald ‘Bato’ dela Rosa’s proposal for a law to ban the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the country. It’s actually stupid and you wonder if Bato really had the balls. Of course, no Senator has come out in support of his proposal and what’s good for Santa Saba Leila (De Lima) is also good for Bato, going by MLQ3’s logic. Fair enough. Bato should have balls because he does have balls. Leila has balls because she eats men’s balls for breakfast. Maybe lunch and dinner as well, given the testimony of her security escorts.
The Senate has actually turned into a circus. It used to be that it would not pass up the opportunity to investigate a sitting president. Former President Joseph ‘Erap’ Estrada was tried by the Senate. During the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (GMA), it conducted several hearings into alleged anomalies which earned GMA the title of the most unpopular president. But witness how the present crop of Senators whitewashed the investigation of Bato’s committee about the drug use of the president and the diamond star. This is in stark contrast to Hontiveros forcibly linking Alice Guo to Duterte. The same is true with Harry Roque and his legal sleight of hand with the arrest of the foreigners renting his house in Tuba. I don’t know about you but this makes me puke.
There isn’t any reason to vote for Senators in the midterm election. Each of them cost taxpayers about P400M a year. Their new building’s cost is at P23B and counting. While we’re at it, the house of representathieves should be abolished as well. Most, if not all, of the congressmen are legitimized criminals addressed as “honorable”. The present state of our country is such that a revolution can easily be launched. But the main drawback is we are stupid Filipinos who continue to put up with the shenanigans of our elected officials.
We get the government we deserve and this is why most of our regional neighbors see us as a joke. When do we put an end to this?",Others
Maria Ressa won her Nobel Peace Prize by being DISHONEST,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/maria-ressa-won-her-nobel-peace-prize-by-being-dishonest/,"The news that Maria Ressa, CEO of Philippine online “news” site Rappler, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee has been met with more disgust than kudos by Filipinos. Those who were disgusted could not fathom how someone who has been spreading fake news and is a convicted felon could manage to receive a supposedly prestigious international award.
Those who were congratulating Ressa claim that she “brought honour to the country”. However, that claim has baffled a lot of Filipinos as well because, firstly, Ressa is also an American citizen and doesn’t even speak Filipino well. Her critics say her loyalty does not lie in the Philippines. That’s not too farfetched considering she didn’t grow up in the country. In fact, Ressa is quite often out of the country on her many PR blitzes or promoting herself and her body of “work”.
Second, Filipinos who are proud of Maria Ressa for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize either do not understand why she received it or don’t care if she painted the Philippines in a negative light before the international community just to win accolades and awards. Ressa once claimed before a 60 Minutes interviewer that “the situation in Manila is far worse than any war zone that I’ve been in”. That was a big fat lie. The situation in Manila was never like a war zone. A foreign journalist by the name of Ted McDonnell was outraged by Ressa’s claim and tweeted that it was “unadulterated bullshit”.  He said he has worked in the Philippines for five years and knows that it is safer than many places in the USA.
Filipinos who do not feel outraged by what Maria Ressa said should have their own loyalties examined. How can they let her lie like that? As Manila Times columnist Rigoberto Tiglao wrote in his column, Ressa was never a war correspondent. It wasn’t like she was on the ground as the fighting was going on. So her claim of being in a war zone was a lie as well.
Ressa would like everyone to believe that she is God’s Gift to Journalism and that she is saving the country from being torn apart. In every interview she has had with foreign journalists, her claim is always the same -– that journalists in the Philippines are “under attack”. It’s a complete fabrication. The truth is, there are Filipino journalists who don’t even like her because she acts like she is so full of herself. One journalist admitted to me that she is not well-liked in the industry. She is not really one of them. I can believe that because she is practically a foreigner. She sees the Philippines through the eyes of an expat. Her stint in ABS-CBN as head of the news division prior to creating Rappler was not great. There was talk of a toxic environment when she was there. Let’s just say that her colleagues did not miss her after she left.
In an recent interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Ressa said the biggest problem in the Philippines is the spread of misinformation. But the biggest source of misinformation in the country is mainstream media. There are journalists who are allied with politicians who publish negative propaganda against rival politicians. This was evident when former President Noynoy Aquino was still campaigning for the Presidency and even more evident during his six-year term. Ressa’s Rappler was a constant source of propaganda against Aquino’s enemies. Rappler kept publishing article after article against Aquino’s perceived enemies like the late former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona. As a matter of fact, it was an article published against Corona that got Ressa and her journalist in trouble with the law.
Ressa’s bias is very evident in the way she criticises current President Rodrigo Duterte. She is relentless in publishing inaccurate articles against him. It wasn’t the case with the previous President. She was kinder and handled Aquino with kids’ gloves. This was odd considering Aquino’s term was disastrous and resulted in thousands of deaths due to his bungling management style. The environment was even more dangerous for journalists during Aquino’s term. I have not heard of journalists being murdered under Duterte’s term. It was only right for National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose to say that Ressa does not deserve her Nobel Peace Prize. Democracy is alive and well in the Philippines and that’s no thanks to Ressa. No journalist is in jail or in trouble just for criticising Duterte. The only reason why Ressa is in trouble is because she broke the law on foreign media ownership and for publishing of libelous content against a private citizen.
It’s disappointing how many foreign journalists fell for Ressa’s exaggerated statements about the real situation in the Philippines. It just goes to show that they will believe anything a fellow foreigner like Ressa would say just because the Philippines is a Third World country. It’s also further proof that a lot of foreign journalists are elitist and do not respect the country’s sovereignty. They prefer to apply their own version of “democracy”. What they don’t realise is each country has its own nuances and capabilities as a society. It is not always black or white.
Maria Ressa’s supporters and those with a misguided sense of national pride are asking why people can’t be happy for her. It’s because she won it by being dishonest. She painted herself as a victim of “oppression” and “tyranny”. The truth is, she has used her publication to terrorise people she personally does not like. The Nobel Prize committee just gave her more ammunition to continue what she does best – to divide and destroy the national fabric of the Philippines. Her Nobel Peace Prize is a big sham, indeed.",Others
SHOCKING: Award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa is an INSULT to the Filipino people!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/shocking-award-of-the-nobel-peace-prize-to-maria-ressa-is-an-insult-to-the-filipino-people/,"News just broke that Rappler CEO Maria Ressa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is an astounding demonstration of the extent to which Ressa had managed to hoodwink an entire profession into lapping up her dishonest narrative of “attacks” on “press freedom” being supposedly perpetrated by the Philippine government. Al Jazeera reports that Ressa, along with Russian Dmitry Muratov “were given the prestigious award ‘for their courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia,’ Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said on Friday.”
One wonders if this Norwegian Nobel Committee actually did their homework. It seems all they did was consult members of a vast echo chamber that envelopes much of Western Big Corporate News Media. Indeed, if they had, in fact, used “journalists” as resources in their “research”, it all the more makes Ressa’s win quite suspect. Across a large swathe of this community seems to be a common denominator — eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. In their article “How One of America’s Premier Data Monarchs is Funding a Global Information War and Shaping the Media Landscape”, Alexander Rubinstein and Max Blumenthal write…
With offices in Washington, Silicon Valley, and six foreign countries, the Omidyar Network propagates the neoliberal ideology of its billionaire namesake through “impact investing” and a “property rights” initiative. Outside the U.S., the Omidyar Network funds an array of foreign media outlets, like Ukraine’s Hromadske and the Philippines-based Rappler, that have participated in pro-Western information warfare-style campaigns against rogue governments. In Zimbabwe, where the Omidyar Network supports a series of oppositional youth organizing initiatives through the Magambe Network, an Omidyar employee was arrested, accused of attempting to stir up a revolt through online organizing, and ultimately released (the incident is detailed later in this article). This February 12, Rappler editor-in-chief Maria Ressa was arrested as well, accused of “cyber-libel” by the Filipino government for a 2012 article. The Omidyar Network and the Omidyar-funded Committee to Protect Journalists have set up a $500,000 legal defense fund for Ressa.
Back in 2019, under intense grilling by Ezra Levant, “Rebel Commander” at The Rebel in a conference on “media freedom” hosted by Omidyar,  Ressa inadvertently admitted that she had received $4.5 million in funding from Omidyar.
Interestingly, Levant’s question was initially directed to Nishant Lalwani, Director of Investments of the Omidyar Group challenging the sense of his hosting such a conference when, Levant points out, “no one here is not on your payroll”.
Lalwani then categorically stated, “we gave some money to Rappler…” after which he was abruptly cut off by Ressa who then proceeded to hijack the rest of the response to Levant’s initial query.
Watch the video…
Indeed, Ressa behaved really badly there. She had been discussing an ongoing case she had with the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a public forum. To Ressa’s claim that she was “winning” this case, Levant pointed out that “Omidyar gave up his stock,” suggesting that Omidyar had, perhaps, recognised then the risk in his exposure to Rappler.
At some point, Ressa was forced to point out that the amount involved was “only” $4.5 million.
Only.
After a few more minutes of Ressa carrying on in her usual shrill manner, Levant finally reminded her that the question was not originally addressed to her — perhaps recognising the disproportionate defensiveness she had just exhibited.
Clearly Maria Ressa was being absolutely dishonest in her so-called “advocacy” to “protect” whatever “press freedom” was, she insists, “under threat” in the Philippines. The truth is, this was, even then, a time-wasting sorry excuse of an advocacy manufactured by a discredited thought leader to whitewash the utterly failed venture called Rappler.
Earlier that same year, no less than the Associated Press (AP) itself fell victim to Ressa’s lies. The AP had to delete a tweet it posted and implied that it was misled by statements provided by Ressa…
The AP deleted a Wednesday tweet on journalist Maria Ressa’s arrest. It incorrectly said she was arrested for criticizing Philippine President Duterte. Authorities said she was arrested over a libel complaint, but Ressa argues the government misapplied the law to target her.
This was a landmark retraction by a major news media organisation as many others continued to “report” misleading information about Ressa’s arrest on charges of libel.
Erstwhile respected “journalist” Christiane Amanpour, for example, seemingly stood by the very significantly slanted take on the matter that the AP now distances itself from…
You know a government is desperate when they arrest a journalist.
President Duterte: FREE @mariaressa NOW.

Evidently, Amanpour needed to be reminded of the most relevant fact of this matter — that only a Philippine court can decide on that which she called for.
On reflection, it would have been a reasonable ask at the time that the rest of the global “journalism” community get a grip and step back from all the misleading emotionalism kicked up by Ressa in her desperation to sidestep the task she was being taken to back then. It could have been an opportune time for the community to revisit the core values of the journalism profession and understand the root cause of the crisis of relevance and credibility that the corporate news media industry suffers today.
Respected Filipino columnists were already on to Ressa even further back. In his January 2018 Inquirer column, Oscar Franklin Tan pointed out the dishonesty in the public statements Rappler had been publishing about her case after the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a shutter order to Rappler for violation of constitutional provisions banning foreign control of media businesses in the country. Notable among these was the idea that the SEC move was the start of some sort of “assault on press freedom” being mounted by the government of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. According to Tan, this was not consistent with the SEC position which was very clear on the specific items in regulation surrounding the issuance of the types of funding agreements in question. The SEC report pointed out that clauses that extend “veto rights” are provided in Rappler‘s agreement with its foreign funder Omidyar Network. These rights are not found in similar instruments issued by ABS-CBN and GMA to their respective investors.
Indeed, the SEC order did not, in any way, present a future threat to any other news media network. This was all about Rappler‘s violation of the Constitution. And the threat to “press freedom” was all in the minds of Ressa and her Rapplerettes.
If there had been any actual threat to “free speech”, it could be found in how Rappler went about reporting about its own predicament at the time. Rather than highlight the true facts surrounding its case which all pointed not just to Ressa’s negligence as CEO but to a seemingly deliberate effort mounted by her company to circumvent corporate regulation, Rappler‘s reporters put up mere strawmen.
Ressa and her henchwomen were actually the ones abusing their freedom by baldly misleading the public. Tan put it quite succinctly: “Free speech cannot justify Rappler’s misleading coverage of Rappler”. Ressa should heed the words of the venerable Oprah Winfrey: Time is up. So is the jig.
Rappler had, at many times since it sprung up seemingly out of nowhere in 2012, been all but exposed as a non-viable business venture and, worse, a channel out of which dishonest journalism is served to an unwitting Filipino public. Norway is a long way from the steaming Philippine political and business scene both culturally and geographically. If the trustees of the venerable Nobel Foundation value the brand equity of their hallowed “Peace Prize”, they should revisit their decision to award it to Maria Ressa. Do a bit of homework. Talk to real Filipinos. It really can’t be that hard.",Others
Parties and politicians opposed to the Anti-Terror Bill put partisan agendas first before Filipinos’ safety and security,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/parties-and-politicians-opposed-to-the-anti-terror-bill-put-partisan-agendas-first-before-filipinos-safety-and-security/,"One of the issues being raised by the Opposition in the coming 2022 election is the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which is an updated version of the Human Security Act of 2007. It has come under scrutiny because its main sponsors are Senate President Tito Sotto and Sen. Ping Lacson, who are running as a ticket for President and Vice-President under the NPC-Reporma-NUP-UNA coalition. Lacson and Sotto have been tagged as “Duterte-enablers” by the Opposition as a result. Never mind that the two have been vocal in their description of their tandem as neither pro-Opposition or pro-Administration, but pro-Philippines. The bill passed the Senate last February 26, 2020, with Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Pia Cayetano, Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, Grace Poe, Imee Marcos, Manuel “Lito” Lapid, Joel Villanueva, Cynthia Villar, Emmanuel “Manny” Pacquiao, Win Gatchalian, Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, Richard Gordon, Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, Bong Revilla, Francis “Tol” Tolentino, Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, Majority Leader Migz Zubiri and Senate President Vicente C. Sotto III voting in the affirmative while Senators Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan and Risa Hontiveros dissented.
The Opposition would like to make the law an election issue because they claim that its provisions violate the human rights of an individual who is identified as a person of interest. What are objectionable to the Opposition and its allies are the provisions which severely curtail the ability of suspected terrorists and terrorist networks to operate once preliminarily identified by the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), which is tasked with implementing the Anti-Terror Law and the authority of the ATC to order a freeze on their bank account and request for wiretaps from the judiciary. The members of the ATC are the Executive Secretary, who is the Chairman, the National Security Adviser as the Vice-Chairman, the Secretary’s of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Interior and Local Government, Finance, Information and Communications Technology, Justice and the Executive Director of the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat.
“We think this is against the constitution,” said human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno. “Given the broader definition of terrorism, the administration’s critics could be tagged as suspected terrorists.” Opposition Congressman Edcel Lagman said Duterte was “tightening the noose on suspected terrorists at the expense of the protection of human rights and civil liberties.” In the meantime, Senate Minority Floor Leader Franklin Drilon of the Liberal Party said “I signed it on the basis of my best judgment that strikes a balance between protecting our people against abuses by the state and protecting the state itself. All I can say is I tried my best. I can face anyone and say I am not favoring anyone.It was in my desire to have a balance between the desire to prevent terrorism and balance it with the rights of the people. I have done my best.”
At present, there are thirty-seven (37) pending petitions at the Supreme Court questioning the Constitutionality of its provisions. The 37 petitioners, clustered into six groups for the purpose of final position papers, have all submitted their memoranda to the High Court on June 25. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) has also submitted its 800-page memorandum in defense of the law, which means the countdown has started in the Supreme Court. “By the sheer number of petitions it might take some time before the Court can at least prepare its draft, but hopefully within the year perhaps we can have a decision on [those] 37 petitions before the year ends,” said Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo in a chance interview last July 8.
Sen. Ping Lacson was initially included in the list of Presidential candidates that convenor group 1Sambayan was considering in an effort to come up with one candidate to represent the opposition against the administration in the May 2022 polls. Lacson removed himself from consideration by way of a formal letter to former Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, the lead convenor. Lacson said that after seeing Carpio’s television interview, “I have been under the impression that 1Sambayan colation has effectively precluded a possible association with this representation, since you made it clear, as its lead convenor, that it would be ‘inconsistent’ and ‘incongruous’ for the group to endorse, let alone, be identified with somebody who is one of the authors and the principal sponsor” of the Anti-Terrorism Law. While you have explicitly and repeatedly made a remark during the interview that you have ‘no problem’ with me running again as a senator in the upcoming national elections, I could not possibly reconcile how much would be the case if it has been publicly disclosed by the former Associate Justice that his misgivings are anchored on this representation’s stand in earnestly sponsoring a measure in the exercise of my sworn duty as one of the elected lawmakers of the land,” Lacson added.
Subsequent events have led to the present imbroglio between the Lacson-Sotto camp and that of the Opposition as the two went ahead with their formal declaration that they were running for President and Vice-President after talks with Vice-President Leni Robredo failed. The impression given the public was Lacson initiated the talks but Sotto later clarified that it was the Vice-President’s Chief of Staff who sent a text message to his counterpart in Sotto’s office to arrange the meeting. Sen. Lacson later disclosed that the Vice-President rejected his proposal outright at the onset without even taking the time to give it serious consideration.
The Anti-Terror Bill has become more essential in light of the Taliban regaining control of Afghanistan after the US’s hasty pullout. Terrorist groups again have access to a safe haven from which they could operate from and plan attacks in the future. The problem with the Opposition is they refuse to look at the law from the point of view of national security, giving preference over the issue of civil liberties. It has been made worse by their supporters labeling the Lacson-Sotto tandem as “Duterte-enablers” even if the the sponsorship of the law was made clearly in the interest of protecting the Republic and its citizens from threat of terrorism, domestic or otherwise.
National security is also an election issue seeing as how we are caught in the middle of the rivalry between the US and China in the region. The Anti-Terror Bill is an update over the Human Security Act of 2007. It is clear that it is not meant to strike down civil liberties but to prevent acts of terrorism and even organized crime syndicates from endangering the citizens of the Republic.
As Sen. Lacson said, “we are neither pro-Administration or pro-Opposition. We are pro-Philippines.” Lacson added that he and Sotto would stick to the conduct of an issues-based campaign instead of the usual mudslinging and black propaganda saying that the Filipino people deserve nothing less during this crucial juncture of our nation’s history. The challenges the country faces needs a serious, credible and responsible leader.",Others
Former President Rodrigo Duterte arrested on orders of the International Criminal Court!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/former-president-rodrigo-duterte-arrested-on-orders-of-the-international-criminal-court/,"So former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested today on the back of a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The arrest was effected at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport as Duterte returned from a trip to Hong Kong. This follows widespread speculation propagated by detractors — mostly members of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis — that Duterte was there to evade this arrest.
So what happens now? It seems that very little is within the control of Filipinos or their government from hereon. An Inquirer report points out that the ICC “has jurisdiction over individuals who bear criminal responsibility for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression.”
Once an order for surrender is issued, the person is delivered to the Court, and held at the Detention Centre in The Hague. The ICC Detention Centre operates in conformity with the highest international human rights standards for the treatment of detainees.
What do Duterte’s supporters plan to do? That remains uncertain too. It is likely that the usual indignation activities, various forms of protest rallies, social media storms, and other similar initiatives are the only options left for them. For his part, current President Bongbong Marcos whose father was given a hero’s burial under Duterte’s administration is doing a Pontius Pilate.
As predicted, the Philippines has once again assumed the all-too-familiar position as welcome mat to Western foreign powers’ preferred world order and the agents of institutions they lend legitimacy to.
As I wrote sometime back…
The fact is, the Philippines risks huge loss of reputation if it subjects itself to an ICC “investigation”. In southeast Asia it is only the Philippines and East Timor that had, at one time or another, been parties to the Rome Statute. Not that there’s anything wrong with being an African country but being the first Southeast Asian nation to succumb to the “authority” of the ICC will make Philippines come across like one of those dysfunctional states in that continent. It seems, members of the Yellowtard-Communist Axis are willing to burn an entire house down just to kill a couple of rats. And then there is the issue of convincing an electorate that said rats actually are rats.
Perhaps Duterte did commit all those crimes he is accused of and, now, in the custody of a foreign “court” for. But, see, that is something that should have been left to Filipinos to investigate and account for within their own country’s legal frame and criminal justice processes. Sadly that opportunity for the Filipino people to demonstrate a sovereign capacity to sort themselves out under their own terms has eluded them again and laid bare their continued beholdenness to all things colonial.",Others
"Apart from Bamban Mayor Alice Guo, We Have Foreign Meddling in a Boracay Property Dispute Too? (Part One)",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2024/05/apart-from-bamban-mayor-alice-guo-we-have-foreign-meddling-in-a-boracay-property-dispute-too/,"I’d say the Philippines has more than enough to contend with in as far as foreign meddling is concerned.
Having watched and read news of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo’s now questionable citizenship and alleged connection with illegal activities in a POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator) sitting on property in her town, I feel drawn towards the impression that the Duterte Administration was operating the Philippines more like a brothel house solely for his Chinese national cronies rather than protecting and serving the welfare  and interests of the Filipino people.
Foreign meddling seems like an abstract concept until one considers the victims of the crime and corruption of POGO operations. In the case of the Bamban POGO, the victims were people who were lured into human trafficking or tricked out of their money through various scams. (If illegal drugs, torture, and killings somehow came into the picture, I wouldn’t be surprised because who knows what really happens in these POGO enclaves.)
Over in Boracay, a resort town on an island North of Panay, is another sort of meddling by a 73 year old British national who makes it appear on social media that he is legally operating a media enterprise of a sort in the Philippines. Although, how he could manage to do that in a country that restricts the foreign ownership of mass media is unclear to me at this point.
The Philippine Constitution limits the ownership and management of mass media to citizens of the Philippines or corporations, cooperatives, or associations that are wholly-owned and managed by citizens.
The 12th Regular Foreign Investment Negative List (RFINL) issued in June 2022 prohibits foreign equity in mass media, except for recording and internet. The Anti-Dummy Law (ADL) also prohibits foreigners from being appointed to management positions in nationalized or partly nationalized businesses.
Foreign journalists and newsmen need to apply for a temporary visitor’s visa to visit the Philippines. They will need to provide a curriculum vitae, work credits, sample article, media organization background, administrative arrangements, equipment list, flight details, and photographs.
To operate media enterprises in the Philippines, foreign media must apply for an IPC Accreditation Form and Bio-data/General Application Form for Special Work Permit at the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID). Each crew member will need to pay P6,440.00 plus P60.
As for engaging in advertising and promotions, Section 11, Article XVI, 1987 Constitution. “xxx Only Filipino citizens or corporations or associations at least seventy per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens shall be allowed to engage in the advertising industry
Thing is a simple search on Facebook reveals a multitude of posts of him promoting events and places in Boracay. Below are just two recent posts by Jeffery.
Moreover, foreigners are not allowed to influence/lobby for the creation and implementation of policies. As such, a number of Jeffery’s posts on Facebook gives the impression of being able to get officials in Aklan to pass or revise a number of policies favoring foreign nationals as well as tourists.
Victor Jeffery, who portrays himself on Facebook as being married to a Filipina, has taken on the cause of championing the “rights” a Canadian couple whom he claims were victims of intimidation and forcible eviction. Likewise, the British national has also taken the cause of a lawyer who claims to be the owner of true owner of the place where the Canadians were evicted from.
Jeffery would appear to be some sort of crusader setting the heathens straight, UNTIL you learn about the other side of the story he isn’t telling on Facebook.
Since Jeffery published an account of events which took place at a place called The Cliff on Mt. Luho in Boracay, it is in the public interest to know the other side of this story which he has HIDDEN in attempt to gain sympathy for the Canadian couple and the lawyer claiming to be the owner of The Cliff.
In Jeffery’s account, which was published in the Facebook Group named Boracay Island News where he is an administrator, he states:
Boracay Community.
What’s going on up at Mt Luho?
Angry property disputes have started again at several locations in the Mt Luho area despite many court cases over the past few years.
Can we not handle these matters at local level before they blow into an international incident and bring disrepute and damage to Boracay’s reputation. (Emphasis added.)Surely, due legal process instead of heavily armed security should be the order here. These residents have rights also.
While not directly accusing Ramos of using intimidation, harassment, skirting due legal process, and disregarding rights, Jeffery’s public Facebook post containing bare allegations unfairly portrays Ramos in such a bad light that it could have already damaged her reputation. A sure sign of the bad reputation Jeffery’s Facebook post inflicted upon Ramos were negative comments that could be construed as being directed at Ramos.
Case in point is an exchange between Jeffery and a Facebook account holder named Rosemarie Sen.
Rosemarie Sen
Victor Jeffery
Several people I know who are longtime occupants there hold court documents stating they own their properties Rosemarie. One is a Supreme Court ruling. Apparently, all the invading security guards have are guns – no paperwork.
Surely the ‘rule of law’ should be upheld and provide adequate protection for those who have already had legal rulings on their cases.

Boracay Community
The Philippine National Police (PNP) has been asked to revoke the permit of a security agency over its role in the alleged illegal takeover of a property at world-famous Boracay Island in Malay town, Aklan province.
Lawyer Lucas C. Licerio urged the PNP Supervisory Office for Security and Investigation Agencies (SOSIA) to terminate or suspend the permit of Safety Protection Yielders Security Agency (SPY) Security Agency over the incident.
Licerio pleaded in a letter dated May 2 to Police Col. Marlou Roy Alzate, SOSIA chief, to act against SPY Security Agency. “The security agency is implementing unlawful orders from its client,” Licerio said.
He said that SPY security guards have taken over armed men and assumed jurisdiction over the Licerio Estates since April 24.
SPY security guards reportedly denied entry to individuals who have private villas inside the Licerio Estates, including foreign nationals from Canada and Russia.
This was the latest incident in a more than a decade-long legal battle over the Licerio Estates.
Licerio, who represented his family as co-heirs, initially sold 700-square meters of the more than one-hectare property to Dolora Khanna in May 2007.
Not long after, Khanna filed an injunction plea against Licerio to vacate the entire property.
The injunction plea that was eventually denied by the court in Kalibo, Aklan led to the discovery that Khanna falsified documents that made it appear that she owned the entire Licerio Estates. She also sold portions of the land that she did not own.
Khanna would later be convicted of estafa through falsification of public documents by a court in Kalibo. She had a warrant of arrest but she reportedly has fled the country.
Licerio said that before Khanna left the country, Khanna tapped Marichi Ramos of Bacolod City to be the attorney-in-fact to manage the Licerio Estates.
Ramos allegedly took over the management of the estate that Khanna does not legally own while claiming she has legal rights over the land.
Police reports said Ramos and German national Charles Schmidt went to the Licerio Estates on the night of April 23 with armed men to physically take over the property.
By April 24, SPY guards came to the Licerio Estates to render duty for the camp of Ramos and Schmidt.
“The SPY guards, therefore, are committing illegal and criminal acts either as principals or accessory in violation of their sworn duty as deputized agents of the PNP to uphold the law,” said Licerio in the letter to Alzate.
Licerio called on SPY Security Agency “to immediately cancel or terminate its contract with Ramos or anybody acting on her behalf involving Licerio Estates.”
A copy of the letter was also furnished Police Brig. Gen. Jack Wanky, Police Regional Office-6 chief.
Again, Jeffery puts out a one sided story where he claims lawyer Licerio alleges that Ramos had illegally taken over his property and it would have been believed by the PNP SOSIA if Ramos hadn’t written to the office to counter Licerio’s allegations.
In her letter to Philippine National Police PRO Region VI Regional Commander, Brigadier General Jack Wanky, Ramos alleges that Licerio, without contributing anything to the construction, forcibly took over the resort using armed men pretending to be police officers, and has been illegally selling and leasing the property ever since. She further claims that Licerio turned over the villas to Canadian nationals who were not authorized to own properties in the Philippines, and that they engaged in human trafficking by operating a brothel.
Ramos also mentions a previous complaint filed against Licerio for the illegal takeover, where the Security and Investigation Services of the Philippine National Police (SOSIA) ruled in her favor. This order, Ramos argues, prohibits Licerio from deploying any security agency at The Cliff Resort without complying with certain requirements.
The letter presents a complex case with multiple allegations of wrongdoing, including:
Illegal takeover: Ramos alleges that Licerio forcibly took over the resort using armed men, violating her property rights.
Fraudulent activities: Ramos claims that Licerio has been illegally selling and leasing the villas, defrauding potential buyers and renters.
Human trafficking: Ramos claims that the Canadian nationals who took over the villas engaged in human trafficking by operating a brothel.
Violation of SOSIA order: Ramos argues that Licerio is violating the previous SOSIA order by deploying another security agency without fulfilling the necessary requirements.
(It’s important to note that these are just allegations made by Ramos. The veracity of these claims requires further investigation and legal proceedings.)",Others
Rowena Guanzon a hypocrite for leaking her decision on Bongbong Marcos disqualification petition,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/rowena-guanzon-a-hypocrite-for-leaking-her-decision-on-bongbong-marcos-disqualification-petition/,"Commission on Elections (COMELEC) commissioner Rowena Guanzon should have know better. Leaking her decision on the disqualification petition against administration candidate Bongbong Marcos to the media was wrong because it violates the “sub judice” rule for cases that are still in review. No less than COMELEC spokesperson James Jimenez himself explained in his piece “Sub judice” published in the Business Mirror on April 2018 this rule that Guanzon now violates with impunity…
It is a rule that, in essence, restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to pending judicial proceedings, as a well settled limitation on the freedom of speech. It encompasses not only the participants in the pending case, including the members of the bar and bench, the litigants and witnesses, but also to the public in general—necessarily covering statements made by public officials.
Jimenez goes on to write about what he thinks motivates people to break this rule and why he disagrees with their reasons for doing so…
I understand why people choose to ignore the rule, and why some quarters would rather hear—or read about— battling soundbites. It’s certainly more exciting that way and, on a more practical note, probably provides a comforting buffer against an uncertain (or predictable, depending on how you look at things) outcome. I understand, sure, but I disagree. Despite the adrenalin rush of being in a wild-wild-west environment created by ignoring the sub judice rule, the fact remains that it ultimately does not advance the cause of determining the truth about the issues at hand. Quite the opposite.
Even more interesting is that Guanzon herself is a stickler for this rule and seems to apply it selectively on parties that are, shall we say, associated with political camps that are opposed to those she is evidently loyal to. In 2019, Guanzon invoked the sub judice rule while overseeing the review of petitions filed against former National Youth Commission (NYC) chairman Ronald Cardema whose application for substitution as the first nominee of the Duterte Youth party-list was being protested at the time by the College Editors’ Guild of the Philippines, the National Union of Students of the Philippines, and Youth Act Against Tyranny. Guanzon reportedly warned participants in the review…
“Refrain from giving interviews since he [Cardema] is already sub judice,” Comelec Commissioner Rowena Guanzon said during the first hearing of the case.
The same Inquirer report notes; “A violation of this rule is punishable under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court”, suggesting that Guanzon could be in contempt as it applies to quasi-judicial bodies such as the COMELEC. Nonetheless media organisations allied with the Opposition are only too happy to indulge Guanzon’s impunity with Rapplerette Paterno Esmaquel II getting up close and personal with the “embattled” COMELEC commisioner.
NOW: Rappler’s news editor @paterno_II sits down with feisty Commissioner  @rowena_guanzon to dig deeper into the infighting among Comelec officials and what led her to cast a vote against the candidacy of the ousted dictator’s son.#RapplerTalk: https://t.co/Pib497VMqf

It is clear that rules, as far as Yellowtards see them, magically turn into mere recommendations whenever it suits their dishonest agendas. In this particular case, it is quite evident that Guanzon is acting in desperation — desperation to fulfill her role as the Yellowtard COMELEC commissioner the Opposition are counting on to commandeer her office to the noble mission of preventing another Marcos presidency. And these crooks wonder why Filipinos are so on to them and their dishonest campaign.",Others
Duterte “arrest” in the Philippines possibly non-compliant with Rome Statute Article 59 arrest procedure,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/duterte-arrest-in-the-philippines-possibly-non-compliant-with-rome-statute-article-59-arrest-procedure/,"Questions have been raised around the way former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was picked up by police at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila, bundled up, and shoved into a private jet bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands where he now waits to face the “International Criminal Court” (ICC) in The Hague.
Article 59 of the Rome Statute spells out in Item 4 that “the custodial State shall consider whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty to surrender the person to the Court.”
Arrest proceedings in the custodial State
1. A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.
2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:
(a) The warrant applies to that person;
(b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and
(c) The person’s rights have been respected.
3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for interim release pending surrender.
4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a) and (b).
5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the escape of the person, before rendering its decision.
6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status of the interim release.
7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon as possible.
The “custodial state” in this instance may have been the Philippines although, to be fair, the Philippines withdrew itself from the jurisdiction of the ICC back in 2019 under Duterte’s watch.
Some have speculated that the above procedure may, instead, be performed in the Netherlands which remains a signatory to the Rome Statute and, presumably, is a valid “custodial state” in the context of Article 59 as such. According to a recent news report, “Duterte was taken to a detention center on the Dutch coast ahead of an initial court appearance in The Hague.”
No mention of whether Item 4 of the arrest procedure will be conducted as of this writing.",Others
Only criminals and terrorists benefited from the UP-DND military ban agreement,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/only-criminals-and-terrorists-benefited-from-the-up-dnd-military-ban-agreement/,"What makes students of the University of the Philippines so special that they get to study in an exclusive sanctuary against state security forces that no other student bodies in the Philippines enjoy? The fact is, all Filipino students and all jurisdictions that are subject to Philippine law already protected by the Bill of Rights which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly. Why then are the communists and their “woke” comrades in the Philippine Opposition framing this issue as some sort of “assault” on “academic freedom”?
The Communist Party of the Philippines and the honchos of its vassal front groups would like everyone to believe that all Filipino students are beneficiaries of an agreement between UP and the Department of National Defense (DND) that makes UP campuses “safe” from the the military. This is a lie. The only real beneficiaries of this agreement are none other than communist elements. They enjoy a parasitical relationship with the UP student body effectively using them — including most ordinary students who merely want to study in peace — as human shields. This is the true crooked intent of the CPP in the outrage fad they are now drumming up to “protest” the termination of this agreement by the DND.
As a matter of principle, an agreement to ban soldiers from the UP campus is nonsensical — because it is a redundancy. All Filipinos are guaranteed individual rights by the Philippine Constitution against persecution and arbitrary arrest and detention. Why then is an agreement on top of that necessary? Is such an agreement even legal? Imagine the Ayala family signing a similar agreement with the DND to make the Ayala Center a sanctuary from the Philippine Police or Army. Ridiculous, right?
The bottom line here is that UP students are not criminals that need to be fearful of state security forces. The only people defending this ludicrous sanctuary “agreement” between UP and the DND are criminals and terrorists. Usually it is the simplest explanation that is most likely to offer the most sound reasoning. No need to go into lengthy treatises and statements — not to mention obsolete Cold War era slogans — to justify protesting against the termination of a nonsensical agreement.
The communists and their “woke” lackeys in one or the other “activist” group as well as those “reporters” under the employ of Big Corporate Media should stop insulting the intelligence of Filipinos. It’s hight time things are simplified and all these redundant and unnecessary complications that hinder efficient law enforcement and military intelligence gathering be dismantled. Now na!",Others

Dick Gordon’s blue ribbon “investigation” into DOH procurement: in “aid of legislation” or in aid of ELECTION CAMPAIGN?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/09/dick-gordons-blue-ribbon-investigation-into-doh-procurement-in-aid-of-legislation-or-in-aid-of-election-campaign/,"The traditional sins of omission of Senate investigations “in aid of legislation” are on exhibit again this being the an election year. Politics is tough in the Philippines. It’s tough everywhere but it’s tougher here because there is no such thing as a principled stand. It is mostly the business of show as an entertainer once said about showbiz. In his PhilSTAR piece today, Boo Chanco gives space to defend Philippine Red Cross (PRC) CEO and Senator Richard Gordon in his piece “The virus is the enemy”. Gordon had recently been accused by President Rodrigo Duterte of using the PRC as a “milking cow” to fund his political ambitions. This comes as Gordon heads the Senate blue ribbon committee “investigating” the deals of the Department of Health (DOH) related to the purchase of pandemic response facilities.
If, indeed, it was proven that some people made money at the expense of the taxpayers at a time of pandemic, we have enough laws to deal with that.
It is horrible to hear Duterte calling Gordon fat and throwing out innuendoes that damage the reputation of the local Red Cross as an institution.
Gordon merely heads the Red Cross and it cannot be denied that under his watch, the institution has expanded its activities to quickly respond to the needs of our disaster-prone country.
Dick Gordon is probably the only Ateneo alumnus who wanted the Presidency so bad but couldn’t make it. Noynoy Aquino beat him to it in 2010 and all he had to show was his provenance. We all have our biases so we cheer when Gordon roasts a Yellowidiot like in the Dengvaxia hearings and then hate him with a compunction when he turns and trains his guns on the administration. The difference lies in the proof or the evidence presented. In the Dengvaxia fiasco, the dots were all connected. The same with the Janet Lim Napoles “Disbursement Allocation Program” (DAP) scam and the bribery of Senators during the impeachment trial of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona. Of course the disentes didn’t raise a howl because that would be an admission of guilt. But as we came to know about them more, we found that their hypocrisy showed no bounds. They will bend and break the Constitution to suit their needs. All in the name of “good” versus “evil”. The ends always justify the means in their book. It helps also that the propaganda arm comes out swinging with accusations and “analysis.” The Opposition has Rappler for that. Even if there is no factual basis, their “reporting” is de facto “truth” in their minds. Maria Ressa shouldn’t wonder anymore why she’s been hit with libel cases. It really is libel within the definition provided in the Revised Penal Code.
Thing here is the Senators grandstand at our expense. It’s our centavo they’re fucking around with every time they go fishing in aid of reelection or in aid election to higher office. The Commission on Audit (COA) hasn’t released a notice of disallowance for their findings with reference to the DOH audit. Why? Because they still have time to address the issues. That’s the process. It has to be followed because it is in the Audit Manual. Healthcare workers are up in arms over their delayed special risk allowance. Part of the blame is on the COA too. I’m a government consultant at present and I haven’t been paid my professional fees for three months since I started and my engagement is only for six months. Even if I complain, the bureaucracy does not move. Come September 15, it will be four months that I haven’t been paid. It makes me wonder if our Senators are so stupid that they have no idea of how the system works. But that can’t be since they’ve been in government for the longest time. It leads one to ask the question, what’s all the fuss about?
In light of the pandemic, no one has clue about how to go about the campaign for 2022. No mass gatherings unless you can guarantee testing and proof of vaccination. So candidates have this huge headache because there won’t be much of the actual interaction with voters that happens in campaign rallies and sorties. A motorcade is the only option left unless the candidate is willing to learn to ride a motorcycle and do a tour of key cities in the country. The President has apologized to the public for his shortcomings on pandemic response yesterday. He has taken it upon himself to accept responsibility because he is the President. But he did get his licks in against the Senators. We will find out what office Gordon is aiming for by October 8 but he will most likely run for reelection to the Senate but not on the administration ticket that’s for sure.
What we should focus on is how to abolish the Senate and shift to a unicameral parliamentary system instead. The Senate is a waste of money. It makes more sense to have a parliament where the actual government is formed from its ranks. This was the original structure adopted by the Malolos Congress. It was only the Americans who rammed down this stupid bicameral legislature down our throats. It was reestablished in the 1987 Constitution as a control mechanism for the oligarchs and the political elite. The pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses in our political and economic sectors. These need to be addressed to deliver a more effective response to the disruptive nature of the pandemic. We can’t borrow our way to economic recovery. We need foreign capital to jumpstart the economy. Yet the legislature continues to sit on key legislation put forth by the Cabinet’s economic cluster. Under a parliamentary system, the Cabinet ministers are also members of parliament and they can introduce legislation that is more attuned to what the country needs. Under the present system, we’re at the mercy of roughly how many legislators, half of whom, at least, don’t know what their jobs actually are. This is why the 2022 election is crucial for our future and survival. We should elect candidates who present actual platforms with plans of action and not just the old motherhood statements.
The case is being made for Leni Robredo as the best option for 2022. If she’s the best then we’re doomed. She can’t even make a decision on whether she is running or not which highlights her lack of principle. It shows that she does not have the courage to stand by her convictions and make a stand during this crucial period in our history. There is a disconnect between her statements and her actions because she has said that the Philippines cannot afford another six years of a Duterte at the helm and, yet, she can’t make a categorical statement if she is running or not. This is not how a natural-born leader behaves. Yesterday, Erin Tañada tweeted his tweak of the Beatles classic, Let It Be, turning it into “Let Leni Be”. This does not suit Robredo. She is more of The Great Pretender.
If the Opposition can’t come up with an alternative platform and all they can do is put on a show at the Senate then they don’t deserve our vote. We should consider other options but it won’t really amount to much given the shallow talent pool. Even if Leni, Isko and Pac-Man ran together, their collective abilities still won’t amount to the point that it would make a difference.",Others
Are the Yellowtards and communists capable of assassinating Bongbong Marcos?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/are-the-yellowtards-and-communists-capable-of-assassinating-bongbong-marcos/,"News of an assassination plot against administration presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is making waves. The plot was reportedly uncovered on TikTok. On TikTok. Sounds ridiculous of course but then supporters of Marcos’s rivals in the Opposition aren’t exactly the brightest of the lot. It’s like this most recent video of Leni Robredo doing the “finger heart” gesture like an idiot that went viral on the Net recently. It seems to have been made as part of the same shoot of that  equally-idiotic Hadouken video that came out November last year.
The point is that much as the Yellowtards and communists try to keep their internal operations and conversations under wraps, there will always be the the odd idiot or two among their lot who just has to put something out on social media. As an old pal aptly puts it, KSP is the root of all evil. Another video possibly coming from the same production that, by now, is widely-recognised to have been astoundingly ill-advised somehow making it into social media again could be just the tip of the iceberg. A trove of rotten plans and initiatives — including, perhaps, an assassination plot or two, or three — may lay hidden behind the closed doors of the Yellow and Red camps of the Opposition, just a social media KSP away from being exposed.
An assassination plot is something that is hard to put past the strategists of the Yellowtards and communists. Over the last six to eight months, after all, they have tried everything to sink the BBM juggernaut. From traditional garden-variety demonisation, international demolition jobs, disqualification petitions, and debate baiting, the Yellowtards and communists have tried it. Yet they have so far failed to gain any ground. Marcos remains set to bag this year’s elections and, guess what, only death could stop him now.
Last week’s forming of an alliance between the commies and the Yellowtards is an interesting development. This is effectively the prayerful “good guys” getting in bed with people who are associated with the terrorist New People’s Army. Members of both groups would be hard-pressed to deny that they wish Marcos dead. It is difficult to imagine that, within their chi chi echo chambers, assassination hasn’t been brought up even at least once over the last 12 months.
A Second Marcos presidency is, indeed, unthinkable — if you are a Yellowtard or communist, that is. The loss of face would be inconceivable. Put yourself in the shoes of a bunch of people who’ve only known a world that sees them as the “good guys” and the Marcoses as the bad — no, evil — guys and you could at least begin to understand how so upside down and inside out the world has become for these bozos. So unnerving, perhaps, as to consider that final solution.
Just like how their pals thought the Hadouken and Finger Heart videos where good ideas at the time, assassinating Bongbong Marcos may be a temptingly good idea to them now. Same thinking applied to the same problem — preventing a Marcos return to Malacanang. Filipinos deserve an Opposition that think a bit further ahead than that — not just further ahead but differently. Surely, one might be tempted to think, assassinating Bongbong Marcos is too hideous a thought even for people like the Yellowtards and communists. Then again, look at Leni Robredo’s Hadouken and Finger Heart videos and the question “What were they thinking?” so naturally jumps out. How could they have even thought of coming up with such videos?",Others

UP officials could be criminally liable for obstructing police investigations or harbouring terrorists,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/up-officials-could-be-criminally-liable-for-obstructing-police-investigations-or-harbouring-terrorists/,"Aren’t all Filipinos subject to laws regarding obstruction of police investigations? This means any “accord” that gives special treatment to officials of the University of the Philippines (UP) by giving them power to deny police access to their jurisdiction is unlawful by nature.
Philippine law is quite clear about what constitutes obstruction of justice. Presidential Decree 1829 penalises persons who “knowingly or [wilfully] obstructs, impedes, frustrates or delays the apprehension of suspects and the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases”. This includes “harboring or concealing, or facilitating the escape of, any person he knows, or has reasonable ground to believe or suspect, has committed any offense under existing penal laws in order to prevent his arrest prosecution and conviction”. By command responsibility, UP officials who subscribe to the idea that UP campuses are sanctuaries from the police and military are arguably institutionalising a facility to harbour and even conceal criminal elements and activity.
One could also argue that UP officials are complicit in the misrepresentation of information that is vital to an investigation such as, for example, concealing or disguising the true natures of the “activist” front organisations operating within UP campuses. The idea, that these front organisation such as the League of Filipino Students, the editorial leadership of the Philippine Collegian, and groups like Anakbayan, among others that operate with impunity within UP campuses, are front organisations of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and, by association, tolerant of and even complicit to the terrorist activities of its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA) may be debatable. But in being so, that only makes that idea subject to further investigation by state security forces. In supporting a single position on the matter of these communist fronts and standing by measures that aim to impede investigation into that matter (such as the UP-DND “accord”), one can argue that UP officials are in violation of the law which states that “giving of false or fabricated information to mislead or prevent the law enforcement agencies from apprehending the offender” is a crime along with “publishing or disseminating the same to mislead the investigator or to the court”.
Why then should the UP and its officials be given special treatment if there is a crime — or suspected crime — that warrants investigation? Indeed, parents alleging that a crime has been committed within UP campuses — i.e. that their children have been recruited into the NPA — have long been pushing their case. The fact of this matter alone already warrants police presence in UP campuses. The Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights (CHR) itself went on record to clarify that it “does not tolerate armed rebellion and the recruitment of children as combatants”. Allegations that this sort of activity is happening within the jurisdiction of the University of the Philippines therefore must be investigated by the Philippine police. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) should get involved if the NPA — an enemy of the state — are found to be involved.
It is quite clear that the idea of an “agreement” between the UP and the Department of National Defense effectively making UP campuses a safe haven for communist terrorists to operate with impunity and under disguise is ridiculous and a contravention of equal application of the law to all Filipino citizens and jurisdictions. It’s high time that sense prevail over privilege built upon dishonest claims and “revolutionary” agendas. If UP officials see the junking of “accords” that ban state forces from their campuses as an outrage, it raises the question of why they would tolerate an infestation of communist terrorists in the same.",Others
"Religion and politics: an alliance of money, influence, and power",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/01/religion-and-politics-an-alliance-of-money-influence-and-power/,"If there is one event that sent chilling shockwaves to the whole world in 2022, aside from the Russian special military operations in Ukraine and the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign as the head of state of the United Kingdom, it would definitely be the assassination of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan, a country renowned for its public safety and pacifist image with virtually no recent history of gun-related violence, had witnessed its former head of government shot with an improvised firearm in broad daylight during the campaign trail. The perpetrator was previously a member of the Japanese Self Defense Forces, which is essentially to their Armed Forces because the current constitution inhibits Japan to organize its military. His words demonstrated the unholy alliance between religion and politics behind the curtains. This ended up opening new wounds regarding organized religion, remarkable considering that Japan isn’t even a deeply religious country in comparison to other nations.
The assassin’s primary motive for killing the renowned prime minister stems from the fact that the late leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) supported and received political backing from the Unification Church. This South Korean organized movement is labelled as a religious cult by some Japanese academes due to the organization’s use of unscrupulous methods to influence its members. Members of the Unification Church are compelled to purchase various goods at ridiculous prices to boost their “spiritual sales”. This forced some of its members to sell personal properties and even bankrupted numerous families including that of the perpetrator’s. These sales are remitted to Seoul to further expand the religion overseas. With a massive pool of financial resources gained from crippling Japanese families, politicians went close to the Unification Church for political support in the form of votes during the elections. With these politicians providing political recognition, the religious movement enjoyed blanket protection from having to answer to such controversies.
Aside from the Unification Church, Japan also had a horrendous history with another religious cult, the Aum Shinrikyo. This religious movement was the primary culprit for the 1995 terrorist attack in Tokyo’s subway, which had injured thousands and killed fourteen individuals. Sarin, a lethal nerve agent, was used by the perpetrators. The organization was also implicated in the murder of a lawyer and his family in 1989, as his actions as a religious cult buster was perceived as an existential threat for Aum Shinrikyo. In addition, the Matsumoto sarin attack, which served as a precursor to the 1995 sarin bioterrorism, was also linked to the aforementioned group. In the end, the Japanese government has decided to hang the perpetrators, including their founder, Shoko Asahara.
Religion and politics have a long, intertwined history in various parts of the world. Starting with the predominantly Islamic region of the Middle East, the commercial, scientific, and military successes of the Saracens through the formation of a caliphate eventually led Islam as its primary religion. Fundamental differences between its preachers and believers created a significant rift between its major sects, where Sunni Islam and Shia Islam ended up flexing their muscles in a race to gain influence in the world’s largest powder keg. This can be observed with the Saud family in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confronting the ayatollahs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Geopolitics plays a significant role in the Middle Eastern Cold War, but differences in their understanding and interpretation of the Quran adds fuel to the fire.
Despite its seven decade-long history of state atheism, the Middle East’s northern neighbor has also had its own share of religion being intertwined with national politics, which can be observed even today. Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, actively promoted the profession of atheism to its satellite states in the Warsaw Pact. However, unlike Communism, Eastern Orthodoxy stood the test of time, as more Russians are professing their faith to the Orthodox Church. Even though organized religions in Russia are compelled to declare and pay taxes, the administration of President Vladimir Putin provided tax incentives to the Russian Orthodoxy, which in turn supported his political career.
Russia’s immediate European neighbors are no strangers to religion and politics. Western and Central Europe witnessed the creation of the Holy Roman Empire, which unified European territories who share the Catholic faith. European kings and monarchs lead and govern through this idea of the divine right, which legitimizes the political power held by these monarchies. This gave birth to the excesses of the aristocracy and the clergy. Augustinian friar Martin Luther rejected the practices of the Roman Catholic Church through his Ninety-five Theses, most specially these indulgences that have filled the pockets of priests, bishops, and cardinals. The birth of the Protestant faith eventually led to the Thirty Years’ War in the next century, where it resulted to the formation of the Treaty of Westphalia. This Westphalian system forms the backbone of exclusive territorial sovereignty in international relations. Needless to say, the Thirty Years’ War earmarked the emergence of Protestant Netherlands at the expense of Catholic Spain in the European continent, according to Ray Dalio’s “The Changing World Order”.
As a predominantly Catholic country in Asia Pacific, the Philippines also has a lengthy history with organized religion. During the Spanish colonial period, the geographical distance between Madrid and Manila hampered efficient administration of the colony. This left the Governor-General with no choice but to depend on Spanish priests to act and administer the country on behalf of the state. With discontent brewing in the Philippine society, these Spanish priests were eventually confronted with armed revolts. This confrontation unfortunately placed the blame on secular Filipino priests in the late 1870’s, with the public execution of Gomburza.
Despite the inviolable separation of Church and State stipulated in the 1987 Constitution where there will be no state religion, Filipino politicians continue to associate themselves with various religious entities and groups, most specially during elections. After all, these political candidates direly need these votes to propel themselves to power. Numerous politicians are seen cozying up with these religious movements, as their arms are being raised by their respective founders, where these public endorsements serve as guarantees for their victory. Such has been the brand of Philippine democracy.
Freedom of religion has been a core tenet in liberal democracies and is considered as a fundamental human right, where individuals and communities are given the liberty to practice their respective beliefs. Through religion, virtues and values are taught that would aid in having individuals develop a sound moral compass. This is greatly beneficial to the society as a whole because well-guided citizens serve as the foundation for strong yet inclusive societal institutions to emerge. However, religion should never be allowed to transform into a means to feed the greed of the powerful, the influential, and the wealthy. Unfortunately, nobody knows how to hold these organizations, backers, and associates liable and accountable for these deplorable consequences.",Others

In a “joint statement”, the administrations of the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University (DLSU), the University of Santo Tomas (UST), and Far Eastern University (FEU) asserted that their respective institutions “neither promote nor condone recruitment activities of the New People’s Army and, indeed, of any movement that aims to violently overthrow the government.”

A News5 photo posted on Facebook clearly shows that the communist group Anakbayan operates with impunity in UST and actively espouses the overthrow of the Duterte government. A caption included in the photo post quoted Anakbayan UST (to which the photo is also credited) proudly proclaiming that “You can’t spell #GOUSTe without OUST!”
At the time, the UST campus newspaper “reported” that UST officials claim that “the guard assigned at the España gate did not find such a banner this morning.” However no further information on what actions UST administration have taken against Anakbayan-UST nor any of the participants in the protest action they instigated have surfaced.
Though not a signatory to this “joint statement”, the University of the Philippines (UP) is not consistent with the historical record with regard to its own communist denial rhetoric either. Photos abound of student “activist” protest rallies where students showcase similar seditious material with impunity. The following photo clearly shows the familiar acacia-lined streets of the UP Diliman campus as backdrop to what seem to be members of the UP chapter of Anakbayan doing their thing.
Neither is the student body nor campus “journalism” at the chi chi ADMU immune from communist infiltration. A “Black Friday” protest rally participated in by students of the Ateneo in 2018 shows the same sorts of slogans associated with communist “revolutionary” rhetoric as well as membership in the College Editorial Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) — a known Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) front organisation.
The ADMU Asian Center for Journalism which published the above photo further “reported” back then…
The participants were mostly student journalists from the campus publications Heights Ateneo, The Guidon and Matanglawin. They were later joined by their counterparts from the University of the Philippines’s Philippine Collegian and the University Santo Tomas’ The Varsitarian.
Other organizations such as Ateneo Entablado, College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP), League of Filipino Students (LFS), Anakbayan and Kabataan Partylist also participated.
One can easily see the common denominators that are readily-evident in these instances. Communist infiltration of these three Philippine universities is vastly more pervasive and profound than what their respective administrators are willing to admit (or are even aware of). Perhaps they turn a blind eye toward these inconvenient truths, yes? Well that all the more makes them accountable and, quite possibly, liars when they issue “statements” that assert things that are not factual.
How long will Filipinos continue to be in denial of the enormous problem of communists — and their terrorist henchmen — operating within the Philippines’ top university campuses with impunity? Only time will tell.",Others
Leni Robredo should be asked to comment on her role in alleged electoral fraud in 2016 and on Andy Bautista’s flight,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/01/leni-robredo-should-be-asked-to-comment-on-her-role-in-alleged-electoral-fraud-in-2016-and-on-andy-bautistas-flight/,"As poll after poll conducted by reputable survey firms over the last several years confirm beyond reasonable doubt the dismal voter base of of Opposition “leader” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo, the question of her role in the alleged electoral fraud that marred the 2016 election comes back to bite. What happened in 2016 remains shrouded in mystery. Short of conspiring with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to cover up many instances of suspicious circumstances that surrounded the tallying and counting of election returns back then, Robredo was at least a potential beneficiary of said fraud if it did occur.
Most telling is the flight to the United States — in the midst of the controversy — of no less than the COMELEC chairman at the time, Andy Bautista. How he managed to leave the country and, to this day, manage to fly under the radar of public and media scrutiny leads many to speculate that the conspiracy to whitewash the stink of electoral fraud that may have occurred in the 2016 elections transcends partisan camps — from President Rodrigo Duterte’s own seeming ambivalence to electoral reform and under whose watch Bautista managed to escape to the US to the Liberal Party and today’s Opposition keeping mum on the matter. Manila Times columnist Antonio Contreras back in 2019 wrote in his piece “Again, where is Andy Bautista?”…
Until now, it is not entirely clear how the State could allow Andy Bautista to just roam around in comfortable self-exile, when there is compelling evidence that the election process that he presided over was full of anomalies. And it is not just about straight lines of otherwise random votes, or of abnormally high percentage of undervotes which would have already sounded the alarm bell to any election scientist. We are talking here about actual evidence that points to tampering not only with the results but also with the process itself. Election fraud whistleblower Glenn Chong presented to the public a procession of damning empirical data that screamed at the need for validation through a serious investigation, and which could no longer simply rely on the denials by Comelec officials. Vote counting machines that have already been tested and sealed were already transmitting a day before the elections. An illegal fourth server was established and has not been vetted properly, even as the source codes were not properly vetted according to procedures prescribed by law. Shading thresholds of ballots were unilaterally changed by Comelec without informing the parties. Scanned ballot images are missing, or were apparently tampered with, causing the sequence number to exceed the total number of ballots cast. Signatures of those who voted did not match those who are registered. Ballot boxes were deliberately opened and tampered with, some drenched not only with water but with chemicals, and others stuffed with dirt, which was but apropos to the fact that our elections have been dirtied by fraud.
Fast forward to today. It is under the harsh light of these unresolved allegations of electoral fraud that blights 2016 that the mystery of how Leni Robredo, who supposedly beat rival Bongbong Marcos to the vice presidency then, could possibly trail the latter by such an enormous margin in poll after poll baffles so many. Where is that voter base today that could at least lend some semblance of credibility to her supposed victory over Marcos in 2016? Where are those supporters who supposedly voted for Leni Robredo in 2016? Do they even exist?
Such is the enormous burden of proof that rests on Robredo’s shoulders today. No less than Opposition “social news network” Rappler itself “reports” that “Leni Robredo says defeating the dictator’s son in the 2022 presidential race will put to rest his lie that she cheated him in the 2016 vice presidential contest”. Indeed, this is further proof that Bongbong Marcos is a key pillar of Robredo’s campaign and that without him, Robredo’s bid for the presidency literally has not a leg to stand on as she herself admits that she has to beat him to clear this whole mess up.
“Kailangan talagang talunin siya sa susunod na eleksyon para once and for all, mahinto na yung ginagawa niya na pagpapapaniwala sa tao nung narrative na gusto niyang i-push,” Robredo went on.
(He has to be defeated in the coming elections so that once and for all, his narrative [that he was cheated in the  2016 vice presidential race] that he is pushing will stop.)
Perhaps then it is time Robredo be queried on what she really knows about why Andy Bautista managed to escape to the US, remains at large, and is a subject matter that seems to be a no-go-zone for her allies in Big Corporate Media. What really happened in 2016 and what accounts for the discrepancy between Robredo’s apparent performance in the 2016 elections and her dismal preference ratings today? The mystery persists.",Others
"“Free Speech. Yes. Falsehood, No.” – press statement of Wilfredo Keng on Maria Ressa’s conviction",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/free-speech-yes-falsehood-no-press-statement-of-wilfredo-keng-on-maria-ressas-conviction/,"(Official Statement of Mr. Wilfredo D. Keng on the final outcome of the Cybercrime of Libel criminal case filed against Reynaldo Santos, Jr., and Maria Angelita Ressa, of Rappler, Inc.)
When I filed this private complaint more than three years ago, I knew that this was going to be a long and painful process for me and my family. Still, I vowed to see this case to the very end. This is my bid to protect my name, and my sacrifice for my children and our future generations, who deserve nothing less than freedom in the form of absolute truth.
Today, with the judgment of conviction against Ressa and Santos promulgated by the Hon. Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa, I have been vindicated, at least, to the extent possible considering that the damage had already been done. Even today, when the truth should have set me free, Rappler’s lies still resound after the bang of the gavel has faded away.
I have been a private, hardworking businessman for 37 years now. I started out in the humblest of beginnings, a young man selling my wares on a few feet of space in the banketas of Manila. Alam ko ang pakiramdam ng walang ni isang yaman kundi ang magandang pangalan, kaya pinagsikapan kong panatilihin itong malinis sa loob ng halos apat na dekada. It is the same name I have handed down to much children, ang aking pinakamahalagang pamana sa kanila. It is also the very same name which Ressa, with one click of a button, attempted to destroy.
Not today, Ressa.
Motivated by the sheer conviction that I have done nothing to deserve the false accusations against me, I decided to go on my quest for justice even if it meant going up against Rappler, a powerful and well-funded media entity with a global reach, headed by one of Time Magazine’s “Top 100 Most Influential Women in the World” – Maria Ressa herself.
Ressa portrays herself as an alleged defender of press freedom and as a purported target of the Philippine Government, but this in no way exempts her from respecting and following Philippine laws. If anything, being a public figure, mas malaki ang kaniyang responsibilidad na magsabi ng totoo at sumunod sa batas.
As I have proven in the course of the trial, I have never been investigated or summoned for, much less charged with or convicted of, any wrongdoing or illegal act by any law enforcement agency whether here or abroad. Ressa has never disputed this, but has simply attempted to hide behind a technical plea: na sa kabila ng kanilang kasinungalingan, hindi na ako maaring magreklamo dahil lumipas na ang panahon kung kailan ko dapat isampa ito. Justly, this attempt has failed.
Ressa then dares to publicly connect my private suit to an alleged governmental attack on the Philippine Free Press.
This case is NOT a case of the government. I am a private citizen and this is a private suit. I filed my complaint prior to and independently of any case the Philippine Government may have filed against Ressa. Unlike Ressa, who attended hearings but who refused to take the witness stand, I testified in open court because I believe that I am telling the truth. I went through all stages of the legal process with no shortcuts or exemptions. To repeat, it has been more than 3 years. Had the government been, as Ressa falsely claims, connected with my private suit, maaring matagal nang natapos ang kaso na ito
This is NOT a fight against the Press Freedom, an institution I deeply respect and uphold. For years, I have personally suffered from Rappler’s false accusations against me, which false accusations have no place in a responsible and free press. Indeed, it is an accepted legal principle that libel is not protected speech. My filing AND winning this case assures Filipinos that published falsehoods will not remain unchallenged and unchecked in this jurisdiction but will instead be dealt with by law, strengthening the people’s respect for the Philippine Media in the years to come.
Bukod sa pagkaso laban sa mga kasinungalingan at libel ni Ressa noong 2012 at noong 2014, I have filed another complaint against Ressa for yet another libelous act before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati, which I hope to likewise see to its lawful and just fruition.
It is of public record: My counsel had pleaded and begged with Rappler to correct their false public accusations that I am a criminal, or at the very least, to publish my side.
They refused.
They have denied me my right to clear my name. Where else can I go to seek justice and protection but our courts?
And so I did.",Others
Make no mistake. “Pinoy Weekly” is a COMMUNIST publication!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/make-no-mistake-pinoy-weekly-is-a-communist-publication/,"The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) calls it an “alternative media magazine”. Pinoy Weekly is supposedly a “legitimate news organisation” the NUJP insists in a subsequent tweet. Why then would it be a subject of interest for the Philippine Police who, presumably, are looking out for the safety and security of the Filipino public, they ask.
Interestingly, this “legitimate” news organisation seems to have ready access to the Communist Party of the Philippines’ (CPP) terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.
Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya.
Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows.
Pinoy Weekly is cited as a “member of the Altermidya” in a tweet fielded recently by the official Twitter account of the group as part of a thread that denounces a recent police operation that raided the Bulacan office of squatter advocacy group KADAMAY in Pandi where copies of the publication were seized and a “local urban poor leader” arrested for having these in her possession.
Not surprisingly, a who’s who of top honchos of known communist front groups such as Raoul Manuel, President of the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), have come to the defense of Pinoy Weekly.
Indeed, the police are actually right when they cite being “anti-government” as a chargeable offense. Communists are anti any government other than the “dictatorship of the proletariat” they aspire to install following that violent “people’s revolution” they continuously conspire to incite. They don’t seek a change of leadership within any legal frame and certainly not one framed by the current 1987 Constitution. They seek nothing short of the complete destruction of the Philippine government in its current form. That is the singular mission of the communists. Make no mistake.
Is Pinoy Weekly part of this terrorist network? We’ll leave it up to intelligent Filipinos to connect the dots.",Others
Maria Ressa’s criminal conviction is a victory for the Filipino people,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/maria-ressas-criminal-conviction-is-a-victory-for-then-filipino-people/,"They said the whole world was watching. If that was the case, then the whole world knows Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and her former writer Reynaldo Santos Jr are now convicted criminals. This was after a Manila court judge found both of them guilty of violating the cyber libel law. The question is, are members of the international community going to respect the decision of a local court or are they going to look down on this decision because they assume everything that happens in a Third World country like the Philippines is a “travesty”?
Indeed, as soon as the decision was handed down, foreign journalists and high-profile individuals like former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their outrage on social networking site Twitter. There was enough support for Ressa to convince us that she would have been more successful as a lobbyist than a journalist. She certainly had a lot of foreigners fooled — foreigners who already had preconceived notions about the Philippines being a “rogue state”, no thanks to Ressa herself who has been telling everyone who cares to listen that “it’s worse than a war zone”. They all think “democracy is dead” and that “press freedom” is being undermined by the current government. They all blame President Rodgrigo Duterte and accuse him of “weaponizing” the law.
As expected, Ressa and supporters both local and abroad were all “shocked” by the verdict. They thought her PR blitz around the world would be enough to acquit her of the libel case filed by Wilfredo Keng – a private individual who was wronged when a 2012 Rappler article written by Santos published damning claims that Keng lent his sports utility vehicle to then Chief Justice Renato Corona. This was during Corona’s impeachment trial and Rappler played a big role in demonising the former magistrate. A series of articles painting Corona under a negative light were published during the trial including that particular one claiming Keng was involved in human and drug trafficking. They were trying to convince the public that Corona was hanging out with the “wrong” crowd.
I guess you could say the ghost of Corona is still haunting the people who wronged him. He died a broken man shortly after being removed from his post in the Supreme Court. Ressa and her Rappler team played a role in his removal by engaging in character assassination. Those who support Ressa, especially those who did not follow Corona’s trial almost a decade ago, have no idea what they are talking about. Rappler published libelous content against a private individual just to help convict a former Chief Justice. Ressa deserves what she got for supporting former President Benigno Simeon Aquino’s crusade against an innocent man he considers his enemy. Keng is not Ressa’s only victim, but Keng brought justice not just to himself but also to Corona and the public who saw the injustice Ressa was committing then.
Expressions of support for Ressa would have you believe that the judge who presided over the case is corrupt and only bowed to Duterte’s wishes. They are disrespecting the rule of law by saying this. It is quite baffling considering Ressa still needs the court for her appeal. A smart person would want the judges to be on her side. That’s not going to happen if she keeps saying they are in cahoots with Duterte. It would be stupid of her and her supporters to malign members of the judiciary and paint them as Duterte’s lap dogs. The judiciary is an independent branch of government. Duterte cannot dictate his wishes on the judges. To say Ressa’s conviction is because of Duterte is tantamount to saying the court judges are corrupt. Whoever is saying that should be prosecuted.
Ressa and her supporters do not feel sorry for Keng. Rappler damaged his reputation but they still do not want to accept that the article they published broke the cyber libel law. She is not remorseful and doesn’t seem to have any plans of apologising. She keeps insisting that she is entitled to “press freedom”.
The concept behind press freedom is having the right to print or publicise factual information that is vital to the interests or safety of the public. It is not about the right to malign others without suffering the consequences. As a matter of fact, Ressa abused her power as a so-called journalist. She violated other people’s right to due process. She condemned people like Corona and Keng by publishing unverified and false information about them.
Ressa also continues to condemn Duterte before the international community by insisting he stifles dissent and is killing democracy. But Ressa and the rest of the Opposition have been saying that since Day One of Duterte’s Presidency. They contradict themselves everytime they say that. They have been enjoying their freedom to complain under Duterte for years. Proof of this is the fact that Ressa’s jet-setting lifestyle was not affected despite her incessant accusations against Duterte. She can go in and out of the Philippines without any hassle.
The members of the press will be fine as long as they don’t publish libelous content. I really hope other members of the media will learn from this. The conviction of former Rappler staff Santos Jr together with Ressa for violating the cyber libel law should serve as a warning to other Rappler staff. Ressa got Santos in trouble because she is a bad editor and her other cases still pending could prove she is a bad CEO. That could spell the end for Rappler. If I were them, I would look for another job now and not wait for the company to fold.
It’s getting tiring to read articles painting Ressa as a victim. She is not. She has a powerful tool — a media company that can and did ruin people’s reputations. She is just hiding behind the “press freedom” mantra. That freedom doesn’t include maligning others she doesn’t agree with.
I hate to rain on everyone’s parade, but it remains to be seen if Ressa will meet her cell mates any time soon. She is out on bail and will appeal before the highest court in the land. She is already using her conviction to advance her agenda to have Duterte removed by an international syndicate. We will see if her American citizenship will get her US support. But that can only mean the Philippine government can charge her with treason. I don’t think that is bailable.",Others
Maria Ressa is indeed a fraud,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/07/maria-ressa-is-indeed-a-fraud/,"No less than Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reportedly said it. “Ressa is a fraud. Believe me,” Duterte said in a speech last Wednesday. Duterte evidently echoes growing public sentiment over (or, more likely, apathy toward) Rappler CEO Maria Ressa’s incessant positioning of her person and that of her media organisation as hapless “victims” of an imagined government “assault on press freedom”. Indeed, many observers have, on their own, come to the conclusion that this is all just a pile of lies Ressa and her cohorts are heaping before a clueless foreign press that uncritically lap it all up and leave the Philippines copping an unfair bathing in bad light on the world stage.
What does Ressa have to say for herself in response to the Philippines’ enormously popular chief executive? Not much other than deliver even more of the all-too-familiar drivel on Twitter lifted from her worn-out victimhood playbook…
4 years: spewing hate on social media, manipulating Filipinos, weaponizing the law. We call a spade a spade. Was he referring to me? Maybe the President is just seeing too much fraud from where he sits. 🙂   #CourageON #DefendPressFreedom #HoldTheLine
Evidently Ressa hadn’t taken much on board in the way of learnings following a hard-talking she copped from veteran journalist Stephen Sackur on his BBC talk show. “If you are talking about manipulated public opinion,” Sackur asks, then she is, he continues, “de-legitimising” the people’s right to choose their government; that if, as she asserts, their opinions are “fake”, then democracy does not work. Ressa evidently believes that Philippine democracy is broken confirming on record that “democracy is dead” — a claim that is flat out inconsistent with the clear-as-day reality of the Philippines that surrounds her.
Ressa is, indeed, a fraud. This is not just Duterte talking as even his own critics attest to the dishonest nature of Rappler’s brand of crooked journalism as “concerned citizen” Andrew Fornier writes…
I have little patience for the kind of journalism she has represented, in which the reporter is a celebrity of greater importance than the stories she has to tell. There’s a constant undercurrent of arrogance that oozes from the paragraphs of Rappler, particularly from its opinion pieces, which seems content to berate the common citizen for their “ignorance” and proclaim, in all self-righteousness, that there is only one way to look at the news.
Clearly not a fan of the Duterte administration, Fornier bristles over the “boneheaded stupidity of whoever masterminded this farce of a trial” that resulted in the conviction of Ressa for offenses against libel law. Nonetheless, whatever motivated Wilfredo Keng to slap charges against Ressa and her hapless patsy Reynaldo Santos Jr is beside the point as former Chief Justice Artemio Panganiban points out. The law is the law, and it is being dispensed by a functioning judiciary which Ressa sought to and continues to seek to belittle. Indeed, such was the arrogance of Ressa that she refused to dignify the courts with a sensible defense! Panganiban laments, “Ressa and Santos should have testified to defend themselves and to widen the crack in the prosecution’s armor…” Panganiban continues referring to Ressa’s ill-fated legal strategy…
As I have always said, judges decide cases only from the evidence vetted in court, not from street parliaments and media utterances. It is unfair to accuse the judiciary of bias, incompetence, subservience, or corruption for ignoring out-of-court tirades.
Looking back to all that, it seems Duterte was actually being kind when he called Ressa a fraud. Ressa is actually a moron. She was made moronic by her own arrogance. At least frauds aspire to be clever in the perpetration of their crimes. Ressa, however, is a sad accidental criminal on account of her hubris. That is way more tragic than being a fraud.",Others
Libellous allegations of “plagiarism” vs GRP tweeted by @znsuzara (a.k.a. Budget Babe) illustrate the dishonesty of the Yellowtards,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/libellous-allegations-of-plagiarism-vs-grp-tweeted-by-znsuzara-a-k-a-budget-babe-illustrate-the-dishonesty-of-the-yellowtards/,"At Get Real Post (GRP), we put in reasonable effort to ensure the content we publish is of the highest possible standard. This, of course, does not stop our detractors from dismissing it as a “fake news site” (bizarre, considering GRP is not and has never claimed to be a news site). Even more notable is how the same detractors claim that we publish “trash”, again a strange conclusion considering most of them cannot even prove that they have actually read any of our articles. All this is, of course, nothing new when one considers that most Filipinos generally don’t read and are more comfortable being told what to think rather than thinking for themselves.
So the most recent stunt launched by Twitter personality Zyza Nadine Suzara (a.k.a. Budget Babe), a former staff member of the infamous Aquino-era Budget Secretary Butch Abad, involves accusing us, specifically Yours Truly and author Ilda of plagiarism.
Suzara uses as bases for these accusations a tweet from Twitter user @sienabs05 (a.k.a. “Tita Siena”) who, in an earlier tweet, exhibited a screenshot of a “plagiarism checker” app she applied to GRP article “A year after the Ukrainian crisis: what’s for the Philippines?” authored by our contributor who goes by the handle “The Unpopular Opinion”.
“Tita Siena” went on to draw conclusions from this, further tweeting (translated to English): It is on record that the most recent blog entry of one fake news-peddler-cum-pseudo-political-analyst-from-the-land-down-under is not an original work. We’ve found that these were taken from other political analysis sources. Interestingly, “Tita Siena” seems to have stopped short of using the word “plagiarism” in her own tweet thread. More on that later. What is notable is how users of what seems to be the same app (check-plagiarism.com) “Tita Sena” cited had reported on its unreliability and dubious accuracy in a thread on StackExchange.
Here is the accepted answer to the above question recorded in the StackExchange community the gist of which is as follows…
Answer: They are inaccurate, but moreover – they are simply not “checker[s] for plagarisms”, even if some of those programs have names which appear to claim the contrary.
The reason is that plagiarism is a subtle concept; determining whether some piece of writing P is plagiarized or not requires, in many cases, a proper understanding of the contents of P as well as of the context of P. Understanding those things is far beyond what software can currently (2022) do.
What software tools like the one you showed in your question really do is some kind of automated (probably statistical) analysis of texts, and highlighting of some parts of the text. The output of the software does not determine whether something is plagiarism. The fact that such a tool shows some absurd text message as a result (such as “33% plagiarized content” in your screenshot) tells us something about the software, not about the text it analyzed.
One of the most highly-regarded “plagiarism checkers” in the market is iThenticate, a product sold by the company Turnitin. The language used by the company is very precise. The tool measures similarity to identify instances of potential plagiarism. Nowhere in the product literature is it asserted that a capability to make an absolute conclusion of a case of plagiarism exists in their product line. This means that even the best of such tools makes no claim to that ability. This is articulated in detail in a company blog article “Does Turnitin detect plagiarism?” which states categorically, “Similarity does not equal plagiarism. The two concepts are not the same.” It also clarifies; “that’s why we call it the Similarity Report. You’ll notice we don’t call it the Plagiarism Report or – even worse – the cheating report. We don’t detect those things, and we’re not in the business of making those determinations.” The blog author Patti West-Smith, Turnitin Director of Customer Engagement and a “20-year education veteran” further writes…
There, I said it. This might ruffle some feathers and challenge some notions, but we need to clear the air. I’ll say it again – SIMILARITY does not equal PLAGIARISM.
Now that we have that out of the way, let’s dig into that statement a little more, and see if we can bring some clarity to the situation. As far back as 2013, Turnitin has been writing blog posts, speaking out, and generally finding any opportunity to clear up the question of whether our products detect plagiarism. No matter how many times we address the subject, we still encounter people around the world looking for the answer. On our Turnitin Educator Network, where Turnitin users around the world come together to ask questions and share ideas, the topic resurfaces year after year, and in my direct contact with educators and students around the world, it also comes up regularly. Our Customer Onboarding and Education teams report that the topic frequently surfaces in trainings as well. So, we KNOW that there is a great deal of uncertainty. The answer, however, is simple: Turnitin does not detect plagiarism. In an effort to clear up any remaining doubt, let’s go through some of the most frequent questions we hear one-by-one and try to answer each one as simply, directly, and clearly as possible.
So, here’s the short of it. The only person in the room accusing us of “plagiarism” is none other than Zyza Nadine Suzara alone. Not even the Twitter user she quotes goes as far as using the P-word. The free app used as bases for these unsound allegations has been found to be unreliable and downright dishonest. The dishonesty in any tool that claims to identify cases of plagiarism is elaborated upon by no less than the Customer Engagement Director of Turnitin — a company that sells iThenticate, one of the most highly-regarded of such products in the market.
There should be — and will be — consequences for the kind of dishonest behaviour Suzara exhibits online as well as for the harassment she incites using her dishonest allegations. More importantly, Suzara does all this with clear malicious intent to defame the subjects of her personal vendetta.",Others
“Activists” calling for the “junking” of the Anti Terrorism Bill are ANTI-Democracy!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/activists-calling-for-the-junking-of-the-anti-terrorism-bill-are-anti-democracy/,"What Opposition “activists” and “partisans” essentially seek when calling for the blocking of the proposed and long-overdue Anti Terrorism Law is free rein to continue their seditious activities with impunity. These peoole are, after all, holdovers from vintage 1980s thinking who subscribe to the obsolete idea that people can simply mass on the street in a demonstration of “people power”, “demand” that a legitimately-elected leader step down, and then proceed to set up a “revolutionary” government for themselves.
Indeed, it is easy to see that this remains their preferred means of changing governments. This, despite the fact that the Philippines has long had a working institutionalised process for doing just that in an orderly manner that assures sufficient public representation in the outcome. That process is called an election. Opposition “activists” led by the Yellowtards (the bloc within it rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists prefer to bypass elections in favour of a street mob making national decisions on behalf of all Filipinos. In short, they prefer an illegal pathway to change in leadership. Writing for The Diplomat in 2016, Professor Mark R. Thompson, Acting Head of the Department of Asian and International Studies and Director of the Southeast Asia Research Centre, City University of Hong Kong, observed…
The precedent set by People Power in overthrowing a dictator was stretched to legitimize the toppling of an elected leader disliked by the upper classes.
Indeed, the 1986 EDSA people power “revolution” set a precedent for succeeding governments to “legitimately” disregard the law. This addiction to “people power” as a means to get things done became a virulent social cancer and a blanket threat that was kept hanging over the heads of the succession of presidents that followed. Even today, rumblings of a threat to mount, yet again, some sort of “people power” spectacle to unseat Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte are beginning to ripple across the chattering classes.
It is therefore ironic that these very same “activists” now decry what they perceive to be the “arbitrary” way the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill would designate as terrorist an individual or a group. In fact, many of their arguments easily come back to bite their inconsistent positions on most things.
A group featured in a tweet by “human rights defenders” Chel Diokno calling itself the “Free Legal Assistance Group” (FLAG), for example, asserts in a statement that the bill “classifies as terrorist acts common crimes already penalized by existing laws”. They of course don’t mention that the very nature of the “people power” they conspire to mount against the government is, itself, a tyrannical act that seeks to usurp the will of Filipino voters legitimised in an election. Whereas an election is a process with (albeit flawed) safeguards against misrepresentation, the street mob parliamentarianism they call “people power” has none of the sort. Now they conveniently ignore the fact that the bill does stipulate a rigorous process the state needs to undertake to regard a person or group as “terrorist”. This is more than could be said of the manner a steet mob would summarily accuse an elected leader of being an “evil dictator”.
The same FLAG statement warns of “the exclusive power of the State to unilaterally ‘designate’ persons or organizations as ‘terrorist’,” which, if true, is really is not too different to the way street mobs espoused by people like the FLAG chairman Chel Diokno also unilaterally designated duly-elected presidents as “tyrannical” and “unfit to govern” without due process as prelude to their “extra legal” removal from office through “people power”. The fact that they conveniently leave out in this argument is that the “state” they refer to is composed of three co-equal branches that check one another’s power and is not the “evil” monolithical agency out to terrorise its own citizens that they make it out to be.
Who then is the real terrorist here?
The truth is, it is this entitlement to illegal means to acquire power the Yellowtards and communists enshrine in their charters that is threatened by the Anti-Terrorism Bill. Under enhanced Anti Terrorism laws, acts of sedition and rebellion that pose a danger to the Philippines’ fragile democracy will be easier to crack down on. Under such laws, Filipinos can truly be vigilant lest terrorists under cover of their false narratives and emotional blackmail snatch it away from them.",Others
Jeffrey Laude Plus Iron Sulfide Equals,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/jeffrey-laude-plus-iron-sulfide-equals/,"I find it so ironic that in the same week that a gender reveal party in San Benardino California lead to the obliteration of 12,000 acres ( as of Thursday night Philippine time) of Southern California’s forests , a certain other gender reveal “party” almost 6 years ago has caused tempers to flare locally. You can say it was quite a week for things “on fire. ”
Much has been said in GRP     and elsewhere about this. I want to formulate my own viewpoint and tie everything back to pinoy culture . I will do so with an assist from Sir Elton John using quotes from one of his hidden gems Sweet Painted Lady . In case you are wondering what does Elton John know about the subject, please keep in mind the lyrics of most of the Elton John hits were written by Bernie Taupin.
I’m back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We’re all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we’ve learned
If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there’s pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won’t need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright
Joseph Scott Pemberton. was 19 years old during that eventful Oct night in 2014. Were you ever a 19 year old guy? If you are a woman, have you ever seen a group of 19 year old boys together after being in a predominately male environment in the middle of the ocean for over a month? Are you one of these people who have no idea why there are a concentration of brothels in close proximity to a major harbor? JSP was the archetype of a serviceman “hunting honey with money to burn”.
I smell women
Smell ’em in the air
Think I’ll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there
from the musical Les Miserables
So this is nothing new. US military do their own form of conquering foreign lands with dollars as their ammunition. We all know the US gives intel to all their employees visiting foreign lands and I am sure Olangapo is no exception. considering there was a fully operational US Naval base there pre- Cory. For those who have no idea what that area is like I wrote about one of their most famous residents once.
I would have to believe that the Navy/ Army/ Marines in their pre-shore leave briefing would have warned that there were certain locals who are not what they represent themselves to be. Then again my thoughts  wander to Cafe Havana in Greenbelt at night and the duplicity I assume that goes on there when the sun goes down and the tourist clientele are less than sober. Mr. Pemberton I assume had that fire down below  and sometimes that fire gets in the way of certain processes in the cranium.
Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it’s always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that’s the name of the game
Other GRP writers before me have suggested that Jeffrey Laude turns into Jennifer Laude at night  not to fight crime but to ask :
” Hey, Mister, have you got a dime/ Mister, do you want to spent some time/ Oh, yeah/ I got what you want, you got what I need/ I’ll be your baby, come and spend it on me”
Donna Summer
We all know that Mr.Laude suffered fatal injuries administered by Pemberton shortly after what I assumed was a reluctant and spontaneous gender reveal party. Pemberton did testify that the surprise motivated him to attack but he did not believe his attack was fatal. There has to be some poetic justice that this is getting published on the 19th anniversary of one of the most significant surprise attacks in history.
Your anagrams are showing, doctor. ‘Louis Friend?’ Iron Sulfide. also known as fool’s gold.
Clarice Starling
Like the aforementioned night spot in Greenbelt, Makati , there are enough examples of local “fool’s gold” who ” talk like a woman but walk like a man”  in Olangapo. One aspect nobody brings up in this case. If you feel foreigners have every right to do what Pemberton wanted to do then is it OK for men like Mr. Laude to take away the opportunity from women that Pemberton had in mind. You know , the kind who would not send him into a homicidal rage? If you feel Pemberton is in the wrong for “searching for that kind of fun” then you automatically condemn Laude for providing that service in the first place.
Let’s leave this morbid subject for a brief moment and imagine yourself in a restaurant and you are starving on a Friday night. You order comes after 45 minutes and its loud and you already had two beers. You can’t wait to bite into your medium rare prime rib and the waiter lifts up the cover of the still sizzling dish and you find yourself staring at a tofu steak. How angry are you? The waiter has little motivation to deceive you. But imagine your mood at the moment of truth.
So, she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There’s a place in the world for a woman like you
In my eight years writing for GRP , one my common themes is that many pinoys ignore their lack of skills and international relevance by stretching the truth or false representation. They mask a lousy record in a FIBA tournament by trumpeting the quote of an ESPN commentator, they overstate certain circumstances in the Paul Walker accident and no other country celebrates one silver Olympic medal in 20 years like we do. Another scam that is so pinoy is the load scam written in jejemon and masquerading as the telecom but originating from a prepaid number. The message claims that you have to send them 300 pesos in load since they mistakenly sent you 300 pesos load and their ailing mother needs 300 pesos. Must be some sickness.
The killing of anybody is ugly but there were all sorts of ugly in this case that lead to the tipping point. The craving for the pansin necessary to close a business transaction in a red light district anywhere in the world is often preceded by all sorts of iron sulfide. “Bola Lang Yan ” was the refrain of my former professor. This is not a hate crime. It seems Mr. Laude willingly stepped into the lion’s cage using iron sulfide in an effort to masquerade as prime rib when in reality he was tofu steak. Even in the Elton John song there was a place in the world for a woman that Pemberton thought he was getting for the money.   Mr.Laude  ain’t no woman but wanted to be perceived as one in the places he was hanging out in dressed the way he was. All that glitters is ( not) gold and you might know the rest of that Led Zeppelin song.",Others
Wokes’ brand of justice must never be imposed on the world,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/09/wokes-brand-of-justice/,"A lot of people are up in arms over the pardon of Joseph Scott Pemberton, since they assume he’ll go scot-free back in the U.S. I’m pretty sure he’ll go through a court-martial, despite the claim of his lawyer. Woke protesters had better make sure of this before they make noise.
If they cry, “what about justice,” or “his punishment is not enough,” they’re wasting their time. There are laws and procedures already in place, and their concept of justice is only their construct. They have no right to demand that their concept be followed by others.
Reality doesn’t care about anybody’s concept of justice. It follows its own rules. If you go into the wilderness and die, as Christopher McCandless did, you cannot bring anyone to court over it. It is a self-inflicted death. If someone is released after serving a term for homicide, that’s what the law calls for. I once wondered aloud why we have only 40 years imprisonment for one count of murder instead of life, but that’s the Penal Code. Someone even told me that prisons will be jampacked with life-term prisoners, so the “light” punishment will help decongest prisons. But I digress.
If someone decides to go to the U.S. to kill Pemberton himself, that’s not justice. That’s stupidity.
This is why we have courts and a justice system. When people impose their own justice on others, it can get out of hand. There is a need to inhibit people from carrying out their own concept of justice on others.
This is the problem with both wokes and communists. They assume the “rich” or certain “offensive” people are the cause of poverty and misery in the world, so they try to impose their own brand of justice. This includes shaming, libeling or even killing those they target (y’all are angry about Pemberton killing a transgender, but not about commies killing innocents?). What they want is not justice, but dictatorship. They are the ones who need to receive a dose of justice.
Punishment will never bring back the dead. One may want to punish people who offended them over and over again to try and feel satisfied, but in the end, it may never be enough. Many people have said that even successful revenge will end up feeling hollow and futile.
People with their own brand of justice ought to keep it to themselves. If one takes things into their own hands, they become the dictator. Instead of focusing on revenge, one best focus on working for their own life and happiness. If they want to change anything outside of themselves, they can only affect their own immediate environment and not the world. “Change the world” is also something that needs to be given a rest.",Others
Demonising the police is a DANGEROUS slippery slope,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/06/demonising-the-police-is-a-dangerous-slippery-slope/,"I find it a bit disturbing seeing all the rhetoric meant to incite hatred against the police. Police officers, after all, are people who rush headlong into danger on a typical day at the office. We’ve seen the tragic outcome of incompetent police action back in 2010 when a squad of police officers who couldn’t wield their weapons competently botched a hostage rescue resulting in the death of nine Hong Kong tourists. If we do the statistics, we’ll likely find that more trouble is caused when the police are restrained than when they are given latitude to do their jobs. One wonders then what the end game of the “activists”, radicals, and extremists who demonise the police is.
There seems to be an emerging pattern in the way “activists” always paint the police as the “evil” antagonist. Perhaps it is because anarchy can only prosper when a state’s police forces are significantly weakened. Anarchy, after all, is the foundation upon which extremist elements mount their jihads or “revolutions” whether it be one that seeks to establish their long-overdue (they say) pan-continental caliphate or dictatorship of the proletariat.
What they seem to not be telling the people they seek to convert to their cause is their proposed alternative to the police if they do succeed at crushing them. Obviously there is none other than, get this, standing up their own police force, say, some sort of Taliban or Revolutionary Guard to keep their newly-subjugated population under control. Either way, it is likely that under the rule of an extremist Islamic or communist government, a police state far more oppressive than the one they imagine is the case today will likely take effect.
People need to routinely ask an “activist” or radical a simple question whenever they get an earful of their quaint slogans: And then what?
“Overthrow the US-[insert current president here] Dictatorship!”
And then what?
“US troops out now!”
And then what?
“Junk the Anti-Terrorism Bill”
And then what?
Regardless of what the slogan is being flashed in the latest “street protests” the question is the same and, very likely, will remain unanswered. And regardless of what the “trending” “activist” hashtag is, the police will do their job which is to maintain law and order. Ordinary Filipinos, those who all but roll their eyes up to the sky whenever they see the usual faces and names populating these street circuses, will be happy to see the police do just that.
The police are not the enemy here. Terrorists and extremist elements are. And if not the police, who else will have the means to neutralise these criminal elements? Certainly not the snowflakes who regard their “fight” as one involving wearing a red shirt or brandishing a placard with a cliche written on it while dancing on the streets.",Others
Filipino nurse and UP Manila alumna Faith Nester Poltic in hot water after allegedly tweeting kill formula vs Imelda Marcos,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/filipino-nurse-and-up-manila-alumna-faith-nester-poltic-in-hot-water-after-allegedly-tweeting-kill-formula-vs-imelda-marcos/,"Evidently not having learnt anything over the last few years of electoral failure, the Philippine Opposition continue to behave in the same crass manner that had consistently spelt political doom for their community. The latest bozo to make their Hall of Infamy is a certain Faith Nester Poltic, a nurse who allegedly tweeted a call to any nurse who might be entrusted to the care of former First Lady Imelda Marcos to cause her harm.
Screenshots from her now-locked social media accounts depict her seemingly prescribing lethal procedures that she thought ought to be used on Mrs. Marcos to execute her call. These include switching off her oxygen supply, “fast dripping” her nicardipine solution, and injecting her with insulin.
She suggests this be done “for all of us”.
Poltic is reportedly employed by the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center. Netizens are also reporting that the Head Nurse there is a certain Randy S. Occidental who was said to have issued a statement on Facebook appealing to the public to not immediately judge Poltic whilst they conduct an investigation.
The more important point to make in light of this, however, is the thought that some health care workers may harbour murderous thoughts like these. One wonders whether a broader investigation into the screening process applied to the licensing of such professional is warranted. Nursing, after all, is seen by Filipinos to be a ticket to an overseas job. As such, many of them could be entering the profession for the wrong reasons. This is made even more disturbing by the fact that the Philippines is a major exporter of nurses First World countries.
Notable is the lack of outrage being expressed by leaders and opinion shapers of the Philippine Opposition — a community whose members very likely secretly harbour the same murderous thoughts Poltic expressed on Twitter. Poltic had, in effect, validated what most people suspect of the Yellowtards and communists — that, given the opportunity, they probably would heed Poltic’s call to action. Know we know.",Others
Filipino ‘wokes’ and communists demonising their own police and the military is un-Filipino and ILLEGAL!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/filipino-wokes-and-communists-demonising-their-own-police-and-the-military-is-un-filipino-and-illegal/,"Apparently, it’s become somewhat of a fashion statement nowadays in the chi chi “activist” communities to be parroting “woke” sentiments about the “evils” of the police and the military. What is interesting about this fashion trend is that its fashionista “thought leaders” offer no alternatives to legitimate state security forces and law enforcement agencies that they demonise in the quaint and unoriginal slogans they mouth in their “protest rallies”. Who does one run to then when one is in trouble if one can’t trust the police? The New People’s Army?
That last one is an interesting concept. The NPA is a terrorist band being put up as some sort of “people’s hero” by wokedom. Strange. On one hand, commies and “ativists” decry the police for being an “ill-trained” bunch. On the other hand they would put up as a public messiah a ragtag terrorist “army” made up of youths armed with AK-47s that had been suckered out of their university studies. Even more baffling, “activists” who are actually brave enough to categorically deny they are communists and condemn the atrocities of the NPA seem to discourage people from respecting their men and women in uniform but offer no alternative to who one might run to when threatened by criminals.
It gets even more idiotic when one considers how commies and “activists” seem to suggest, when encouraging Filipinos to reject the authority of the police, that this is license to engage in illegal activities. As such they wear with with pride the righteousness with which, for example, they destroy or deface public property. While they might think their “cause” justifies this, the law is quite clear on the criminal nature of these activities. More importantly, they should consider how the broader public feel about having the funds they fork over in the form of taxes spent cleaning up the mess and repairing the destruction left by these “activists”.
Worse, they take up arms illegally then cry foul when said armed elements are met with similar firepower delivered by officers or personnel of legitimate state forces. The goal of these terrorists is to kill police officers and soldiers yet they waste no time playing the Victim Card when one of their own gets plugged in a police or military operation. In reality, they stay true to the tradition of Filipino necropolitics in the way they routinely use the stiffs they pile up as collateral for their campaigns and “activist” circuses.
If one really comes down to thinking about first principles here, the real outrage is in why the police continue to handle these crooks with kids’ gloves. Terrorism should be regarded with zero tolerance. Groups that hide behind a thin veneer of legality using front organisations should not be spared proper investigation and appropriate consequences if and when found to be aiding and abetting terrorism. They have insulted Filipinos’ intelligence for so long pretending to be unaware of the reality of communist-sponsored terrorism or, even more bizarre, outright denying any linkage or alliance with communist organisations.",Others
Terrorist vs terrorist: Catfight between the communist Teddy Casino and convicted putschist Sonny Trillanes draws laughs,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/terrorist-vs-terrorist-catfight-between-the-communist-teddy-casino-and-convicted-putschist-sonny-trillanes-draws-laughs/,"Looking at the recent tiff between former “senator” and convicted coup leader Antonio Trillanes and the communist Teddy Casino, one need not dig deeper into the matter to get any further insight. The short of it is that both bozos are basically arguing on who made sumbong to the so-called “International Criminal Court” first.
The two little boys, however, miss the bigger point — that they both basically contradict just about every principle they claim to stand for.
Trillanes, for his part, claims to be a “democrat” — presumably one who upholds due process seen through within the legal and institutional frame of the Philippines’ democracy enshrined in its Constitution. As if it weren’t enough how, back in the mid-2000s, he sought to bulldoze over all that using illegally commandeered military resources (in the process endangering thousands of Filipino lives), he now admits to seeking the intervention of a “criminal court” organised by former imperialist powers to usurp the authority of the Philippines’ judiciary in what is clearly a domestic matter. No surprise then that Trillanes was exposed as fake democracy advocate by BBC journalist Stephen Sackur some time back.
The communist Teddy Casino, however, is the even bigger hypocrite. As a communist, Casino presumably lives by the standard communist ululation that all Philippine governments are “puppets” of the “American imperialists” that, together with the former colonial master, rule Filipinos as a “dictatorship”. Thus it is quite hilarious how Casino now rails against Trillanes’s “red-tagging” (aren’t communists Red, after all?) and how he, funny enough, also gleefully supports the prospect of the Western imperialist “International Criminal Court” parachuting into the Philippines to save the day.
Stepping back even further, it is heartwarming to see key “thought leaders” of the Philippine Opposition at each others’ throats even as the very important 2022 national elections loom in the horizon. It seems the Yellowtards and the Communists still fail to grasp just how popular a political force they need to go up against to seize power legally. Then again, considering the two morons in this episode — a convicted putschist and an endorser of a terrorist “revolution”, it is likely that achieving ends legally is not part of any brain-dead agendas here. As such, this is best regarded as the latest circus for those of us with more level heads to gloat over. Enjoy the show!",Others
PhilHealth corruption no different to COMELEC corruption under Aquino’s watch!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/philhealth-corruption-no-different-to-comelec-corruption-under-aquinos-watch/,"Corruption is so endemic to Philippine society that it still boggles the mind as to why Filipino regulators and investigators remain so inept at detecting and prosecuting it. The recent corruption scandals surrounding the Philippine Health (PhilHealth) Insurance Corporation follow a template oft-repeated in the country.
One such approach seemingly taken by crooks to siphon funds off PhilHealth that specially resonates with the public was in the use of IT projects and technology procurement to facilitate this criminal enterprise. The Inquirer reports, for example, how “it was also revealed that PhilHealth procured several items like software and gadgets at a grossly overpriced rate — for example, an Adobe Master Collection Set priced at less than P200,000 was purchased for P21 million.” Another Inquirer report revealed further extent of these illicit activities which resulted in a failed implementation of a “proposed P2.1-billion information technology (IT) project of Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), supposedly designed to stem fraud and scams devised by some corrupt personnel”…
In one of the reports, the government auditors said many equipment that PhilHealth wanted to buy were not included in its Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) for 2018 to 2020, which the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) had already approved.
The impact on the cost of an IT project however is best put into perspective in terms of the toll these compromised implementations of technology have further downstream in terms of the controls and management capability that is degraded by these resulting substandard systems.
PhilHealth’s in-house auditors emphasized the importance of having an integrated IT system as it would serve as “the backbone of a sound health security program.”
“For several years now, PhilHealth’s membership, collection and claims database remain fragmented despite spending billions [of pesos] for IT hardware and software,” the PhilHealth auditors said.
Fragmented systems and flawed IT implementation projects likely contributed to vulnerabilities in systems and procedures that left PhilHealth exposed to control gaps that could be exploited by its executives and insiders. Taken in perspective, the loss is at a magnitude that far exceeds what had been allegedly “stolen” from these IT initiatives. Indeed, the same Inquirer reports reveal that PhilHealth “has lost more than P153 billion since 2013, or “roughly 30% of the total claims payment of P512.6 billion” which the state-run health insurer made in the same period, due to fraud.”
Apparently, this did not seem to bother former PhilHealth director Risa Hontiveros who, on her appointment to the job in 2015 focused on putting herself up as a poster-girl for its services. This raised eyebrows considering that the following year was an election year. Indeed, allegations around the illicit use of PhilHealth resources for Hontiveros’s campaign were flying left and right in the lead up to the 2016 polls…
Health Alliance for Democracy (HEAD) noted that in July 2015, Hontiveros became the poster girl of PhilHealth’s massive advertisement. This included huge posters plastered at the back of passenger buses plying major thoroughfares in Metro Manila.
Also in August 2015, the group said a 30-seconder TV commercial was repeatedly aired in major networks with Hontiveros appearing as PhilHealth head. The group estimates that each commercial could amount up to P400,000 ($8,610).
“There was confusion on how these were funded: Malacañang states that these were funded by PhilHealth, but Hontiveros’s camp asserts that these came from private funds from friends,” Carabeo said.
It is a template case indeed. The PhilHealth debacle is not too different from the malaise within the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) which is marked by reports of cozy relationships between COMELEC execs and their preferred technology vendor Smartmatic. Lax and fragmented control measures as well as problematic implementation of technology solutions at the COMELEC were also likely behind anomalous and, possibly, even fraudulent conduct in the 2016 elections. In the midst of accounting for election results back then, breaches in procedure and data and system handling protocols were being reported including one where a Smartmatic technician “inserted a new program at 7.30pm of Election Day while the system was in the middle of canvassing the votes.” To a large extent this, put the integrity of the entire 2016 elections to question — yet another case of how the crooked activities of a public agency result in far bigger impacts that affect millions of Filipino lives.
Like the PhilHealth malaise, the timeframe of the fraud perpetrated within the COMELEC also dates back to 2013 when a similar fraud case also erupted…
An election case was filed on Thursday before the Commission on Elections against officials of Smartmatic–Total Information Management (TIM) Corp. for allegedly altering the source code of the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines in the May 13, 2013 midterm polls.
Coincidence or not?
It is an outrage indeed. Filipinos have been defrauded of their health and their vote over the last seven years. Both of these sets of criminal activities seemingly got their start in the middle of the administration of former President Benigno Simeon ‘BS’ Aquino III and seem to have been parts of a vast conspiracy to rig the 2016 elections to favour the Liberal Party and its allies. With less than two years to go, the government of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is running out of time to put the perpetrators of these heinous crimes behind bars and make good on the remainder of his campaign promises to reform the Philippine government and rid it of corruption for good.",Others
The Yellowtards are now the biggest fans of the Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Law,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/08/the-yellowtards-are-now-the-biggest-fans-of-the-philippines-anti-terrorism-law/,"The communists certainly won’t be happy with the latest ululations of the Yellowtard-led Philippine Opposition. In recent calls by supporters of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for a “revolutionary government”, “thought leaders” of the bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan are now invoking the new law to pose a challenge to this latest campaign. In her usual editorialised news “reporting”, Rapplerette Lian Buan asks, “are the revived calls for revolutionary government legal?”
Seeking the “expertise” of University of the Philippines Constitutional and Political Law Professor John Molo, she gets a resounding affirmative.
“Public officers took an oath to protect the State. You can’t have the same people plotting revolts. It doesn’t matter what you call it. Anything that does not follow the strict letter of the Constitution is an assault on the State itself,” said Molo.
Not surprisingly, the characteristic selective activism of the Yellowtards is now on full display with its foremost partisans now seizing this bit of legal insight.
No less than COMELEC Commisioner Rowena Guanzon weighed in on the matter issuing an aggressive call to action on Twitter.
The lesson here is that the Yellowtards need to first think before they protest against bits of legislation that they perceive to be “attacks on dissent”. Turns out they now have a basis to act on Guanzon’s call thanks to the Anti Terror Law they got all so shrill about just a month or two ago.",Others
Another Yellowtard social media “activist” @MiaMagdalena sued for allegedly committing SLANDER!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/03/another-yellowtard-social-media-activist-miamagdalena-sued-for-allegedly-committing-slander/,"Yellowtard social media personality Mia Magdalena F. Longid is the most recent of a series of Opposition “online activists” to find themselves in hot water over an ill-thought-out post on the Net. Preceding her over just the last several weeks is a small (more like the tip of the proverbial iceberg) virtual Hall of Yellowtard Social Media Infamy:
(1) The venerable Zyza Nadine Suzara (a.k.a. “Budget Babe”) who, without sound bases, accused two authors of this site of committing “plagiarism”
(2) “Evil nurse” Faith Nester Poltic who allegedly tweeted a callout to her fellow nurses to kill former First Lady Imelda Marcos using lethal means most nurses have access to
Joining Suzara and Poltic is Longid who, unfortunately for the latter, is at the stage the prospect of which the earlier two are likely shittin’ bricks over. The plaintiff in the case against Longid is Ana Maria Paz Rafael, a former assistant secretary of the Presidential Communications Operations Office. In late 2021, Rafael was designated manager of the Benguet Electric Cooperative (BENECO) by the National Electrification Administration (NEA) — a move that prompted the Provincial Board of Benguet to declare Rafael persona non grata (full Inquirer “report” here).
It is likely that Longid, who is a resident of Baguio City and the (now possibly former) registrar of ultra-exclusive Brent International School there, thought she’d run with this and take initiative to mount her own “fight” against Rafael. It seems, though, that she may have encountered a bit of a setback. What seem to be images of documents outlining the resolution of Rafael’s complaint against Longid, which covers offenses related to R.A. 10175 (the Cybercrime Prevention Act) and R.A. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act), have since been circulating on social media.
Rafael alleges that Longid published a post on Facebook containing the text, “pakibalik ang government funds na P58.6 million meant for sitio electrification. Pakibalik din ang milyones na kinuha mo from BPI and PNB na pera ng mga BENECO MCO” [Translated: “Return government funds amounting to 58.6 million pesos meant for the sitio electrification. While you’re at it, return too the millions you stole from the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which are monies beloning to the BENECO Member-Consumer-Owners (MCOs)]. According to the above document Longid argues that the post is “merely a request to ‘return’ the BENECO funds that [Rafael] withdrew”. The second offense related to the Child Abuse Law is in relation to Longid’s alleged including in said Facebook post “a picture depicting herein complainant and her daughter”. Daryl Fajardo, Acting Baguio City Prosecutor asserts, “There is no reasonable and logical reason why [the] respondent should share the picture and [make] such comment, except to disturb the mind of the minor.”
Interestingly enough, Longid is also chums with Rappler Chief Executive Officer and Nobel “Peace Prize” laureate Maria Ressa.
Recall that Ressa was herself, along with one of her “reporters” Reynaldo Santos, Jr. (no longer an employee or Rappler), successfully sued for libel by buesinessman Wilfredo Keng. A disturbing pattern of slanderous and murderous behaviour seems to be emerging from the Yellowtard community — something the broader Opposition ought to pay heed. This is, after all, a community who routinely mount shrill “activist” campaigns against “disinformation” and all of that “evil” stuff that they blame for the catastrophic loss of the Opposition over three consecutive national elections. The irony in their behaviour evidently flies way above their pointed heads.",Others
Militant STAND UP “activist” and former USC Councilor Carl Ieuan Uba in hot water over allegations of sexual misconduct!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/militant-stand-up-activist-and-former-usc-councilor-carl-ieuan-uba-in-hot-water-over-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct/,"Social media is a a abuzz over a certain Carl Ieuan Uba who was councilor in the University of the Philippines (UP) Student Council (USC) over the school year 2021 to 2022.

Allegations of sexual harassment directed against Uba had recently been emerging on social media, many of them authored by former students or group members attesting to having filed criminal complaints against Uba who served in USC under the UP Diliman campus organisation Student Alliance for the Advancement of Democratic Rights in UP (STAND UP). One noted activist, Kelsey Hadjirul who had filed a case tweeted that Uba “was a known sexual predator, facing several cases from different sectors”.

Liza Soberano “red-tagged” because she consorts with COMMUNIST front group GABRIELA,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/liza-soberano-red-tagged-because-she-consorts-with-communist-front-group-gabriela/,"You can tell the Philippines’ communists are getting desperate. They now ally themselves with the Yellowtards (the bloc of partisans rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and their capitalist cohorts in Big Corporate Media. The most loyal of these corporate behemoths, ABS-CBN, now deploy their most bankable talent to the “cause”. The recent circus being kicked up surrounds popular starlets Liza Soberano and Angel Locsin — the earlier having visibly demonstrated support for communist front GABRIELA (which advertises itself as a “women’s issues” advocacy) and the latter coming to her defense.
GABRIELA is cited by no less than Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Joma Sison as one of their front organisations and a tool in their “revolution” to destroy the reactionary capitalist order. Sison said in an old video that recently emerged that the “biggest component organisation” of BAYAN is the Kilusang Mayo Uno (First of May Movement or KMU). He also cited Gabriela, the “women’s alliance”, the League of Filipino Students (LFS), and the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) among others as also being part of this coalition of legal fronts.
In its Asia Report No 202 issued the 14th February 2012, The International Crisis Group cited GABRIELA as one of several groups with “links (denied) to the underground” that won seats in Congress in 2004 after striking a deal with then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo that allowed her to campaign in territory controlled by the CPP’s terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA).
The report describes how the CPP-NPA use tactics to make it difficult for the police and military to operate. Their “use of front organisations obscures who is affiliated with whom”.
In many areas where the NPA is strong, the insurgents have been operating for decades. Local communities and politicians work around the conflict, often making pragmatic decisions to collaborate with one side or the other or both. This inhibits efforts to quash the insurgency by military and police, whose relations with local government units are fraught. Also caught in the middle is the Catholic Church, which wields considerable authority. Even for civil society groups running programs in affected barangays (villages), the CPP-NPA use of front organisations obscures who is affiliated with whom.
Partisans, “activists”, and “thought leaders” within the Philippines’ broader Opposition lap up the notion that groups like GABRIELA are not terrorists yet seem to shy away from challenging them to categorically denounce the terrorist activities of the NPA. Indeed, when “red tagged” by those who do dare to take them up on their obvious communist links, the Opposition prefer to play the all-too-familiar Victim Card and go all crybaby over what they insist is a death sentence.
If it weren’t for the appalling dishonesty in the positions taken by the Opposition to ensure the communists are on their side (and vice versa), it would be quite laughable how these people seek to insult the intelligence of the Filipino people.",Others
Why do communists have a problem with being “red-tagged”?,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/10/why-do-communists-have-a-problem-with-being-red-tagged/,"Isn’t red the symbolic colour of the communist “movement”? Wasn’t the Kremlin, the seat of power of the now-defunct Soviet Union situated at Red Square? Isn’t the People’s Republic of China referred to as Red China? Aren’t the flags of these two former and current (respectively) commie empires predominantly red? Aren’t the flags of front organisations of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) like Bayan and the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) among others coloured red? Doesn’t the New People’s Army (NPA), the terrorist arm of the CPP, wear the colour red along with the hammer and sickle on its sleeve with pride?
So why be all crybaby over being “red-tagged” then?
It’s quite baffling. These radicals like threatening any sitting government with violent “revolution” on one hand and, on the other, are reduced to blubbering babies when tagged as “red”. How about we see the ol’ fighting spirit for a change? After all, these bozos like waving fists in the air as if inviting authorities to do them the honour of battle.
Instead of facing the music, however, these cowards actually go as far as denying their links to the CPP-NPA. One such organisation is the “women’s issues” group GABRIELA. Recently caught in the midst of an imbroglio involving ABS-CBN starlet Liza Soberano, the organisation’s handlers are now doing backflips trying to scrub the red tag off their skins.
“Has there been proof given that Gabriela is an underground organization or a front of an underground organization? I think that is a perfect example of red-tagging. You jump into conclusions and just name an organization or a person that you’re part of this movement,” [Commision on Human Rights (CHR) Commissioner Gwendolyn Pimentel-Gana] said.
Actually, there has never been any categorical denial on the part of any representative of GABRIELA that they are communists. Nor has any representative of this or any other front organisation of the CPP ever denounced the atrocities and unlawful activities perpetrated by the NPA. Indeed, their notion of “battle” is anything but honourable and is downright cowardly.
We see this cowardice in these communist “revolutionaries” in how they hide behind chi chi celebrities like Liza Soberano, Soberano’s Big Corporate Media employer ABS-CBN, and the oligarchs who presume to “lead” the broader Philippine Opposition, the Yellowtards (the bloc rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan). How do they expect to launch, much less win, a “revolution” if they are the bunch of limpdicks that they reveal themselves to be when under the gun?
If the communists want to be taken seriously, shore up their brand, and rise from being the sad laughingstock that they are today, they need to grow some balls. That’s next to impossible if they try to fight from within their comfort zones playing the Woman Card whenever caught in a circus and forever spinning their overused Victim Narrative.",Others
Opposition renews brouhaha over ICC “drug killings” investigation after embarassing June 12 @1Sambayan fiasco,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/opposition-renews-brouhaha-over-icc-drug-killings-investigation-after-embarassing-june-12-1sambayan-fiasco/,"Opposition “thought leaders” argue “if you’ve got nothing to hide then you’ve got nothing to fear” referring to the renewed hype surrounding the International Criminal Court (ICC) inquiry into “drug war killings” it alleges Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte perpeterated. They miss the point, however. It’s not that the Philippine government has anything to hide. In fact, it makes no effort to hide anything and it’s not as if anything can really be hidden in the Philippines where Asia’s most free press is King of the Airwaves and social media.
It seems that the Opposition is back to its old tricks stirring up anti-government outrage fads after the fiasco last Saturday that saw top Opposition coalition 1Sambayan fall flat on its face after candidates snubbed its so-called “endorsement”. The ICC is nothing more than a Mickey Mouse Court that picks on Third World countries. In giving it the one-finger salute, Duterte is showing the world that Third World countries need not put up with the veiled imperialism that former colonial powers wield using so-called “international criminal courts”. The fact is, the Philippine Supreme Court is the highest court in the Philippines. It remains functional and is doing its job as the final authority on the interpretation of Philippine law.
Clearly, the Opposition have not learnt any lessons at all. The style of “opposition” encapsulated by 1Sambayan — replete with tiresome highlighting of Filipino “victimhood” backdropped by annoying breathy acoustic “protest” ballads — no longer captures the imagination of Filipinos. That Opposition “thought leaders” would look to a foreign “court” that is a mere figment of the West’s former place as arbiters of “global justice” proves their ironic beholdenness to the former colonial powers that they claim to detest (if we are to believe the messaging in their protest rallies).
What the Opposition should be focusing on, specially now as the 2022 elections loom closer, is a forward-looking altnernative narrative to the Duterte Way. They are wasting their time on an international body the charter of which simply flies way above the heads of ordinary Filipino voters. They seem to be in denial that another catastrophic loss in a crucial national election is staring them in the face yet again. Foreign intervention, whether it comes from assurances of “solidarity” from Hollywood (or Washington DC) celebrities or kangaroo foreign courts seem to be really potent opiates the Opposition would rather partake in than step up to the more important job of crafting an intelligent opposition platform.
It is evident that Filipinos have had enough of the dishonest Opposition we see today — one whose members contradict their own pretenses of “nationalism” by working with foreign interventionists instead of channeling their “cause” through their own country’s democratic institutions and processes. The numbers tell the true story — numbers that the Opposition, like an alcoholic who won’t admit her alcoholism, simply refuse to come to terms with.",Others
Yellowtards gaslighting Filipinos into believing Noynoy Aquino was a great man is EMOTIONAL ABUSE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/yellowtards-gaslighting-filipinos-into-believing-noynoy-aquino-was-a-great-man-is-emotional-abuse/,"The edification of Noynoy Aquino continues. “Soul-searching” is often mentioned. Few of his faults are highlighted in death. It’s his achievements which are being bruited about along with the anecdotes about how “good” a person he was. I bought into all these in 1983 after his father former Senator Ninoy Aquino was assassinated. No Internet at that time. There was no Inquirer or Star yet. But there was Malaya later on and the other publications of the so-called Mosquito Press. Being a news hog, I lapped up everything.
In all-too-familiar form, Inquirer columnist Joel Ruiz Butuyan asks the question, “Will his death trigger a national soul-searching?”, and then goes on to answer it thus…
When Ninoy Aquino died, it triggered a massive soul-searching for our people, and it resulted in a huge political upheaval. When Cory Aquino passed on, her death generated a second round of soul-searching that swayed the political course of our country. Will Noynoy’s death spark a third round of soul-searching for our country? I sure hope so, because we desperately need another one.
* * *
The premise of then President Noynoy’s Daang Matuwid (“straight path”) mantra was none other than former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA). Daang matuwid was supposed to be everything the Arroyo administration was not even if she was part of the same political alliance that installed her as President after Erap was ousted by Noynoy’s people. Arroyo was a convenient punching bag for the Aquino administration each time something went wrong. Awarded infrastructure projects were cancelled without basis resulting in great expense to Filipino taxpayers in terms of damages awarded in arbitration. Recall the same scenario when the Arroyo administration found fault in the contract for NAIA-3 with Fraport. But no credit was given to GMA for her fiscal reforms which laid the basis for the economic growth brought about by low interest rates as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008.
Infrastructure was also neglected despite the announcement that the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) was the flagship program of the Aquino administration. The MRT-3 became symbol of commuter suffering in the National Capital Region (NCR) after Sumitomo was relieved as its maintenance provider by the then Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). There was the botched handling of the Luneta Hostage crisis, the Zamboanga siege and Mamasapano which reflected badly the on the abilities of Aquino when it came to crisis leadership. Drugs were easily available. A PDEA and UN report stated that majority of barangays in the country had a serious drug problem. There was a shabu tiangge operating in Pasig. Theft of spare tires, car batteries and side mirrors of vehicles parked on the street were rampant.
There were also the corruption scandals in rice, garlic and onion imports, and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) in the Impeachment Trial of then Chief Justice Renato Corona. The Corona impeachment itself was suspect given that it did not pass through the plenary but, instead, was transmitted to the Senate based solely on the signatures of majority of the Congressmen loyal to the administration. There was also the corruption scandal at the Bureau of Corrections where drugs were openly sold and drug lords enjoyed privileges, even running their operations from renovated quarters complete with creature comforts. One even had a live sound and recording studio constructed.
Who can forget travellers entering the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) with their luggage bubble-wrapped because of tanim-bala? There was the Atimonan shootout in Quezon involving the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Army where the P200 million in cash being transported was never recovered. Finally, there was Janet Lim-Napoles and the arrest of the opposition Senators who were expected to run for higher office in 2016. Despite photos showing Napoles and the immediate members of her family with the President and other high-ranking elected and appointed officials of the administration, no investigation was launched against them by then Justice Secretary Leila De Lima. In fact, Napoles was even brought to the Palace after she surfaced and was even escorted to Camp Crame by no less than then Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas!
Were these all figments of our imagination? Didn’t these events actually take place? Could it be that we actually caused grave injustice to one of the best President’s this country ever had? Were we and 16 million other Filipinos deranged and delusional when we voted for Rodrigo Duterte as President in May 2016? Could it be possible that Duterte himself engaged the services of the infamous barangs of Siquijor to cast a spell on Filipinos to vote for him? Do these barangs continue to hold sway over us that a collective exorcism by Archbishop Socrates Villegas is necessary in order to break the spell they have cast? Are we actually living in a tyrannical and authoritarian dictatorship without us ever realizing we are in one? Could Rodrigo Duterte be the devil incarnate written about in the bible? Is the pandemic a conspiracy between Xi Jing Pin and Duterte for control of the South China Sea? Or could it really be that we finally realized the gaslighting which held sway over us from 1986 to 2016 which is why we are now in the reality of our existence?

Gaslighting is a psychological term commonly used in the assessment of narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissists are gaslighters because they exist in their own fantasy world where everything is according to their plan. Narcissists constantly need validation. They have an inflated sense of entitlement and will never admit to being wrong about anything. The victims of narcissists are often emotional and psychological wrecks because they are natural empaths. A narcissist is incapable of showing empathy. To them it is all about their needs and wants which need to be satisfied. It is ever about others around them. The victims of narcissists who do not see through all of their faults are called co-dependents. Co-dependents are generally weak-willed individuals who are led by the nose by the narcissist. The narcissist is in constant need of supply. Supply comes in the form of admiration, validation and generally doing and believing in everything the narcissist says. The co-dependent is always trying to reach the higher bar set by the narcissist in order to avoid being discarded. Gaslighting is very effective when used on co-dependents as a control mechanism. It literally can drive a person mad because of the distorted reality to the point that the victim does not possess the ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy. The constant passing the buck for the consequences of the narcissist’s actions often leads the victim to start believing that HE IS the narcissist in the relationship because of the mirroring the narcissist engages in as part of gaslighting.
Filipinos have been the victim of the Yellowidiots’ gaslighting for far too long. It’s time they put their collective foot down.",Others
“Red tagging” does NOT cause death,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/red-tagging-does-not-cause-death/,"If one were to believe the foremost communist “thought leaders”, one would think that simply tagging a person as “red” is a magical curse that dooms that person to a violent death. Perhaps it is a modern-day version of the Filipino tradition of believing in kulam, or the form of witchcraft practiced by pagan indigenous Filipinos. A mangkukulam (sorcerer) is believed, for example, to have the power to put a curse on a person and see that person suffer all sorts of physical and mental maladies (sometimes leading to death) following that.
The key to the influence exerted by these ancient Filipino sorcerers is the power of suggestion coupled with human predisposition to confirmation bias. When a mangkukulam curses a person out loud in public, such is the power of his or her personal brand as a wielder of powerful black magic that the cursed and, often, her friends and family actually believe the curse will stick and do the job in the coming days. And by some luck, the mental stress caused by the belief she is “cursed”, or even the social fallout (shunning by friends and family) it causes on the cursed, she succumbs to disease, mental illness, or death, that event will go on to further confirm the bias of her surviving friends and family to the belief that the sorcerer who instigated the curse does actually wield such fearsome power.
The key, therefore, to the power of mangkukulams and other sorts of shamans is ignorance. It is, after all, ignorant people who propagate their confirmation bias towards this nonsensical “power” they swear to being witness to. Consider then this dishonest tweet fielded by the eminent “human rights lawyer” Sol Taule.
Oh, she was “red tagged” and then was “shot dead”, therefore “red tagging” caused her death!
One can easily see straightaway how Taule wields magical powers on the ignorant not too different from that of a sorcerer. She’d like to make people believe that “red tagging” is a curse that leads to the deaths of those accursed. In effect, she is insulting the intelligence of Filipinos. Thing is, it seems that many Filipinos are happy to be routinely insulted that way.
Even more disturbing is how a “lawyer” like Taule uses what is, in essence, a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy (the logical error of concluding that an event that precedes another causes the latter) as basis to prosecute people. Indeed, in another crooked tweet, Taule follows through on this primitive thinking and condemns Philippine President Rodrige Duterte, Presidential Communications Operations Office Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy, and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Southern Luzon Command (SOLCOM) chief Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade Jr. to be “thrown in the flames” for causing death by “red tagging”.
You wonder then how a “human rights lawyer” such as Sol Taule who presumes to “defend” the hapless “victims” of the imagined “tyranny” that supposedly blankets Philippine society conducts herself in a Philippine court. For her sake, one would hope she does not use sorcery and witchcraft as the foundations for the arguments she tables before a Filipino judge. Insulting a judge in his own court, after all, are grounds to be held in contempt. Perhaps Filipinos who lap up all that Taule says on public record should also consider the same.",Others
What REALLY happened in 2016: Why the proposed July 12 National West Philippine Sea Victory Day is based on LIES,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/what-really-happened-in-2016-why-the-proposed-july-12-national-west-philippine-sea-victory-day-is-based-on-lies/,"The South China Sea dispute has been in the news cycle ever since President Rodrigo Duterte announced a shift in Philippine foreign policy after he was sworn into office in 2016. It was one that would not be closely-aligned with the United States as the former colonial master but an independent foreign policy where the Philippines would be a friend to everyone but subservient to none.
Since then, it has been a continuing battle between the administration and the Opposition. The latter went on to make, as a cornerstone of its “opposition”, accusing the President of being a traitor and betraying the interests of the country he has sworn to protect and defend from enemies, foreign and domestic. We are not at war with China but the Opposition appears to want to drive the country into one.
Duterte has done away with his predecessor’s belligerent policy towards the regional military and economic giant that is China. His policy of rapprochement has led to warmer ties and a de-escalation of the tension-filled relations during the administration for former President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III when there was a travel ban in place and Philippine banana exports were subject to quarantine before being allowed entry. This was the offshoot of the Luneta hostage-taking incident over which Aquino refused to apologise to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Worse, Aquino also did not speak on the telephone to Donald Tsang, which added insult to the injury and death of the Chinese nationals who were taken hostage.
It is only recently that there have been interesting developments in the issue, which were triggered by retired Senior Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio’s revelations about what went on behind-the-scenes during the filing of the arbitral suit against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, in his Inquirer column “Aquino and the arbitration against China” published right after the death of the former President. In that piece, Carpio wrote gushingly about how “the Philippines’ landmark victory against China in the South China Sea Arbitration” is “[one] of the enduring legacies of President Benigno Aquino III”.
Former Solicitor-General Florin Hilbay, broke his social media hiatus, by posting a detailed account of his version of events which portrayed both the former Justice Carpio and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario in a bad light. As it turns out, both had been pushing for joint-exploration and development of the potential oil and liquefied natural gas reserves to be found at Recto Bank, which is internationally-known as Reed Bank. The arbitral ruling was specific in its language that Recto/Reed Bank is Philippine territory and generates its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This may have been one of the true purposes behind the filing of the arbitral case against China.
Despite the massive infighting that this matter now mires the Philippine Opposition in, factions within the Yellowtard bloc (the members of which are partisans rabidly-loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) remain committed to propagating the lie. Two weeks ago, Yellowtard Senator Risa Hontiveros, filed Senate Resolution No. 762 which, the Inquirer “reported” then, “seeks to immortalize July 12 as the National West Philippine Sea Victory Day commemorating the country’s 2016 victory in the arbitral court against China and in honor of the late former President Benigno Aquino III, whose administration pursued the case.” A desperate effort at best. Hilbay’s revelations have all but unmasked the Carpio – Del Rosario tandem as working for vested interests. More than likely it is for Manny Pangilinan to whom Del Rosario has been closely-identified with even before he joined government as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Carpio’s former high-power law firm was known to be the legal brains behind the impeachment of then President Joseph Estrada. It was through brilliant legal machinations and power and influence-peddling that Manny Pangilinan was able to gain control of incumbent telecommunications company PLDT.
The other mystery in this long-running saga is the role of former Senator Antonio Trillanes as the back-channel negotiator with China. The Senator has never made public what exactly was the role he played. What he has admitted to is his trips during the crisis period when the Chinese fishing vessels, also known as their maritime militia, entered Scarborough Shoal together with their Coast Guard white ships, which triggered the standoff.
We were able to interview an individual who had access to a transcript of an off-the-record interview with Senator Trillanes. According to his his narration, the latter became the back-channel negotiator through the intercession of then Budget Secretary Butch Abad with President Aquino. Trillanes made known to Abad the Chinese government functionaries he met during his study tour in 2011. Trillanes gave the interviewers a verbal summary of the aide memoire he submitted to President Aquino after the standoff was resolved to the detriment of the Philippines. He was tasked to negotiate with the Chinese and report directly to then Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa. At the time of Trillanes’s involvement, there was a total of 31 fishing boats and Chinese maritime militia as well as 50 dinghies inside the shoal. There were also two Chinese Coast Guard white ships outside the shoal. The Philippines only had one Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) patrol vessels inside the shoal and Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels outside the shoal. The timeline is detailed per the infographic below:
The timeline is consistent with the narrative given by Trillanes. The former Senator makes no mention of the names of the Chinese officials he was back-channeling with but official accounts quote him as dealing with China’s Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying. As it turns out, Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario, then Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia and Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell of the US Department of State, were also dealing with the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister on the same issue. Trillanes reveals that the Americans wanted the issue resolved before Aquino left for his scheduled state visit to the US. The US also did not want the standoff to deteriorate to the point of conflict because it was an election year and then President Barack Obama was running for a second term. The US did not want another conflict in its hands because Obama made a campaign promise to get American troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hilbay in his statement made very interesting revelations about Carpio. Trillanes, for his part, does the same with Del Rosario. As it turns out, Del Rosario fed the Philippine Daily Inquirer with two stories; the first was the headline with an accompanying photograph showing the Chinese flag planted on the shoal on June 19. Subsequently, he also fed a story to the Inquirer about a ramming incident where a Chinese fishing boat allegedly hit a Philippine banca (small outrigger boat). Trillanes himself received confirmation from the Inquirer as per his account. The ramming incident took place but it was not deliberate but more of an accident in nature. It also did not take place in Scarborough as the banca’s origin was Pangasinan, not Zambales, which is closest to Scarborough Shoal.
According to Trillanes, President Aquino’s instructions to him were 1) de-escalation of the tensions between the two countries and 2) the agreement to confidence-building measures between the two countries as indication of good faith. Trillanes claims that he was successful in both if it were not for the contrary actions of Del Rosario in Washington where he was in direct contact with Kurt Campbell. Where Trillanes was already able to get the Chinese to agree to a sequential withdrawal, Del Rosario reportedly bypassed both President Aquino and then Department of Transportation and Communications Secretary Mar Roxas, by ordering the withdrawal of the Philippine Coast Guard vessel at the shoal by communicating directly with the Coast Guard Commandant. Evidently, Del Rosario was quite powerful during the period he was a Cabinet member.
The last-ditch effort of the government was to “internationalize the issue” by bringing it up during the Association of Southeast Asian Natins (ASEAN) regional forum where all foreign ministers of ASEAN member countries would be present. The Philippine plea fell upon deaf ears. This was due to the Philippines being perceived as an interloper in ASEAN during the time of President Aquino because it was parroting US policy towards ASEAN instead of acting as one of the five founding members of the group.
The Philippines went on to file the arbitration case against China. Interestingly, the tribunal’s ruling on the Scarborough Shoal was “The second key finding in the case was that neither Scarborough Shoal nor any of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own” and “are therefore legally rocks for purposes of Article 121(3) and do not generate entitlements to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf” (paras. 643 and 646). This means that the only EEZs and continental shelves in the South China Sea are those generated by the coastlines of the surrounding states and, possibly, some of the Paracel Islands. The Spratlys and Scarborough Shoal “generate only a series of 12-nautical-mile territorial seas.” In short, the Philippines lost Scarborough Shoal in the end because the tribunal was silent on sovereignty. Instead, the shoal was pitched for the joint-exploitation of China and the Philippines. What then of Carpio’s fulsome praise for the Murillo-Velarde map, which Mel Velarde graciously purchased, to prove that the Scarborough Shoal or Bajo De Masinloc, as it was known during the Spanish colonial period, has long been recognized as Philippine territory?
Hilbay wrote in his statement on the matter, “On the other hand, Justice Carpio’s formal designation was, as he correctly pointed out, that of an ‘observer’ – he had no direct and formal relationship with President Aquino; was not officially part of the legal team which handled the case; and did not have any authority to speak for or bind the Republic, during arbitration. While his expertise on the matter is a given, as an observer, he had no skin in the game. And yet, he has somehow positioned himself as the voice on the West Philippine Sea case, with authority to make accusations and insinuations ex cathedra.” For the benefit of us who are not familiar with Latin legal terminology, ex cathedra is “with the full authority of office (especially that of the Pope, implying infallibility as defined in Roman Catholic doctrine.” In short, Hilbay challenges Carpio: Who died and made you King?
In the end, the Filipinos spent over one billion pesos for the arbitral case and still lost Scarborough Shoal in the process. But it was a win for Carpio, Del Rosario, and their principal, Manny Pangilinan. Philippine sovereignty was established at the Recto/Reed Bank. Pangilinan has announced he is looking at the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) as Forum Energy’s technical partner for oil and gas exploration in the same area. This, despite an earlier agreement signed between CNOOC and the Department of Energy (DOE) in 2003. A seismic survey was conducted after the agreement was signed during the Arroyo administration which became the basis for the awarding of the service contract by the DOE.
It would be safe to assume that the Administrative Order No. 29 renaming the territorial waters off the South China Sea within the Philippines EEZ as the West Philippine Sea, was also at the prodding of Del Rosario as the then Foreign Affairs Secretary. Think about it though. If there is a West Philippine Sea, why isn’t there an equivalent East Philippine Sea in territorial waters off the Pacific Ocean? The term does not make sense at all.
What is evident now is both Carpio and Del Rosario were not acting for and in behalf of the interest of the Philippines and Filipinos but for Manny Pangilinan and the Americans. The US became wary of China’s rise during the same period which had Obama announcing his pivot to Asia strategy along with a new free trade agreement, which ironically excluded the Philippines, but included the most favored manufacturing ASEAN member countries. The US is not a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but the arbitral ruling enables it to continue conducting freedom of navigation operations, including naval exercises in the contested waters.
The cabal of Carpio, Del Rosario, and Pangilinan expect to get away with murder at the expense of Filipinos in general, and Rodrigo Duterte, in particular. Duterte is just their convenient bogeyman. It is then no mystery at all why Pangilinan and other anti-Duterte oligarchs such as the Ayala’s and Lopez’s are ready to back Manila Mayor Isko Moreno Domagoso’s presidential run. Isko is malleable unlike Duterte who has a mind of his own as former President Fidel Ramos realized too late in the game.",Others
Dispute over firecrackers lead to mother and son Sonya and Anthony Gregorio shot dead by police officer Jonel Nuezca,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/dispute-over-firecrackers-lead-to-mother-and-son-sonya-and-anthony-gregorio-shot-dead-by-police-officer-jonel-nuezca/,"A video has been making the rounds on social media today depicting disturbing footage of what many describe as just the most recent incident of police-perpetrated violence. The police officer on the video has been identified as Jonel Nuezca. A report published on the Daily Tribune describes the incident in the detail available at the time…
The suspect was identified as PSMS Jonel Nuezca, 46, and an active member of the Philippine National Police assigned in Parañaque City Crime laboratory, according to the police report.
Killed were Sonya Gregorio, 52, and Frank Anthony Gregorio, 25, both residents of Brgy. Cabayaoasan, Paniqui, Tarlac.
The shooting incident happened around 5:10 p.m. and was captured on video showing Nuezca, also a resident of the said barangay, engaged in a heated confrontation with the victims before drawing his handgun and shooting the two.
Just seconds before the shooting, a girl, apparently the daughter of Nuezca, approaches and yells at Sonya Gregorio, “My father is a police man!”, to which Gregorio responds; “I don’t care e..e..eh…eh…EH”. Nuezca then says to Gregorio, “Tang-ina mo gusto mong tapusin kita ngayon, ha?” (“[cursing], do you want me to finish you off now?”) after which he shoots her point blank in the head, turns to shoots Anthony twice, then shoots Sonya (by then, lying on the ground) one more time in the head.
Leading up to that point (4 minutes and 27 seconds into the video), a chaotic scene plays out where a shirtless Anthony Gregorio is seemingly being physically restrained by his mother Sonya while Nuezca hovers menacingly close to them.
Through most of the video until Nuezca’s daughter speaks and then shots are fired, various people surrounding the three seem to be pleading to Anthony to shut up. Anthony appears to have been verbally taunting Nuezca. A man who seems to have been trying to diffuse the situation and negotiate with Nuezca on behalf of the Gregorios is seen attempting to put his hand over Anthony Gregorio’s mouth to silence him. The same man is also heard appealing for all to wait for Barangay officials to arrive at the scene.
According to some accounts of the series of events that led to this video (i.e., the missing part of the whole story), Anthony Gregorio had allegedly been firing a boga (a device used to set off firecrackers) that annoyed the Nuezcas. This could also explain the animosity between the Gregorios and the Nuezcas that is evident in the video. Observers commenting on the video suggest that they are neighbours and that there may be substantial history between the two families that may have led to this unfortunate incident.",Others
UP Diliman “activists” who destroyed university property should be EXPELLED,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/04/up-diliman-activists-who-destroyed-university-property-should-be-expelled/,"Want to be a true rules-based society? Then it is clear what should be done to those students of the University of the Philippines (UP) who, while protesting (or, rather, throwing a really bad temper tantrum) over the decision  of the UP Board of Regents (BOR) to select UP College of Law dean Edgardo Carlo Vistan II as the new Chancellor of the UP Diliman campus. Apparently, the preferred  person for the role of these “activists” is former UP Diliman chancellor Fidel Nemenzo.
Not getting what they wanted, these “activists” resorted to violent and destructive means to express their displeasure.

The UP Diliman Student Code of Conduct (2012 Edition) is clear on the consequences of such actions. Section IV.1.3.2. Damage to Property of this document, “Damaging or defacing property within University premises, including but not limited to, littering and vandalism” spells it out:
1. For the first violation, suspension from one (1) week to one (1) academic year, or community service; or
2. For the second violation, suspension from fifteen (15) days to expulsion;
3. For the third violation, suspension for a period of one (1) semester to expulsion.
Provided, that if the misconduct is committed by two (2) or more persons acting in concert and/or committed on the occasion of violent confrontations or any similar disturbance, the corrective measure shall be as follows:
1. For the first violation, suspension for one (1) month to expulsion;
2. For the second violation, expulsion.
In all cases, the students shall be required to repair the damage done at their expense or to pay the costs incurred in repairing such damage. No clearance shall be issued until such damage is fully compensated by the students.
Clearly the “activists” who had exhibited the bad behaviour the other day are guilty on two counts as reported by a certain user Tinig ng Plaridel on a Twitter thread.
What excuse will these students give for such bad behaviour? The answer to that question is a practical no-brainer. Filipino “activists” believe they are entitled to engage in illegal behaviour on the basis of the self-attributed “nobleness” of their advocacy. However, belief in one’s own righteousness is not a sound defense for breaking the law. Just because you believe you are right does not mean you are actually right. Believing you can destroy property because you are right is not right.
Will these students be meted the “corrective measures” spelt out by the Code? In remaining consistent with the selective justice and arbitrary way it is delivered in the Philippines all the next steps we can recommend for now is this: Abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Others
Declassified CIA dox reveal Cory Aquino blamed CPP-NPA for human rights abuses in 1988,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/declassified-cia-dox-reveal-cory-aquino-blamed-cpp-npa-for-human-rights-abuses-in-1988/,"Documents publicly-available from the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) website detail reports on human rights violations that allegedly occurred under the administration of President Cory Aquino. The documents, dated between the 15th and the 29th December 1988, cite reports issued by London-based Amnesty International that assert that incidences of torture perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) “have increased since the Manila government stepped up its counter-insurgency campaign against Communist rebels”.
The CIA report also quotes then President Aquino who, in her official response to Amnesty international, defends her government and points to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) as the more culpable party involved in any human rights abuse happening in the Philippines.
A report on militant organisations published on the Stanford University website describes how the CPP-NPA is founded on the premise that China is the source of both ideology and resources to effect violent revolution in the Philippines. The report also shows the history of the CPP-NPA’s efforts to solicit support from other terrorist organisations around the world.
From its 1969 establishment until the 1976 normalization of Philippine-Chinese relations, the CPP-NPA received support, weapons, and funds from China. However, even though the CPP-NPA modeled its armed struggle on China’s own Maoist movement, Chinese support for the CPP-NPA seems to have been limited. The CPP-NPA also sought support, weapons, funds, and training from like-minded groups overseas, including the Japanese Red Army (JRA), the Maoist factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the Sandinistas, the Communist Party of El Salvador, and many other organizations…
Most disturbing of all is the account of the Stanford report of events that sealed the record of the CPP-NPA as an enemy of the state as well as the baffling way that its current ally, the Liberal Party (today known as the Yellowtards), contributed to the twisting of facts that led to a confused record of these events.
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
Even back then, the confused nature with which the Philippines’ political leaders respond to clear acts of terrorism was on exhibit. Rather than be unified across partisan interests in condemning a bald atrocity perpetrated by a Cold War enemy the Liberal Party, instead, blamed the attack on the government of then President Ferdinand Marcos.
Liberal Party members blamed President Marcos for the attack, which had killed much of his opposition. Marcos, who blamed the CPP-NPA for the bombing, responded by suppressing leftist political activity and suspending habeas corpus. These measures marked an increase in Marcos’ power. In response to Marcos’ repression, hundreds of student recruits joined the CPP-NPA. [27]  [28] Meanwhile, Sison denied that the CPP-NPA had been involved in the attack.
Things haven’t changed much in the last half-century since.
Today, it is interesting how the current Yellowtard-led Opposition, its lackeys in Big Corporate Media, and its circle of so-called “activists” dishonestly water down the nature of the CPP-NPA as terrorists and enemies of the state. They denounce “red tagging” of leftist groups as a “ploy” perpetrated by the government to endanger the lives of members of these leftist groups. However there has been no categorical denial of links between the CPP-NPA and these so-called “leftist” groups coming from any of their leaders.
Indeed, the Yellowtards and their presidential candidate “vice president” Leni Robredo are in bed with legal front groups of the CPP-NPA as they mount a campaign to prevent the rise of leading presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos and his running mate Sara Duterte. They use the buzzword “red tagging” to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside.
Former Rep. Neri Colmenares who chairs Bayan Muna, one of the legal fronts of the CPP-NPA, is a staunch supporter of Robredo’s bid for the presidency. Not surprisingly, Colmenares would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding with regard to the CPP-NPA’s terrorist activities. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate.
Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections.
“One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent).  That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino.
“The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added.
LOOK: The Makabayan coalition came in full force for presidential bet VP Leni Robredo at the ""Pink Sunday"" rally. Senatorial bet Neri Colmenares was at Quezon Memorial Circle, but he wasn't able to go up on stage as he isn't officially part of Robredo's slate. @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/OhmX4XFr0H
— Mara Cepeda (@maracepeda) February 13, 2022
Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat.
According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda.
He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate.
Note that Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case. These have since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building.
That Yellowtard figurehead Leni Robredo, purported “leader” of the Philippine Opposition today, would participate in a dishonest fashioning of communists like Colmenares as “partners” in “building a nation” smacks of hypocrisy considering the late matriarch of Yellowtardom Cory Aquino herself battled these terrorists.

#MeToo Movement erupting in UP Diliman “activist” community amid avalanche of sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2023/05/metoo-movement-erupting-in-up-diliman-activist-community-amid-avalanche-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations/,"It seems that beyond Carl Ieuan Uba, a former member of the University of the Philippines (UP) Student Council (USC) and who served under the UP Diliman campus organisation Student Alliance for the Advancement of Democratic Rights in UP (STAND UP), recently called out as an alleged sex offender by a comrade, there are many more skeletons in the closet of the noble “activist” community of the UP.
Now, a certain Caevene Solas was called out by Carwyn Candila (a one-time — or could still be — spokesman of the communist-affiliated League of Filipino Students (LFS)) in a tweet for inappropriate behaviour during his time as a member of “the collective” at the De La Salle University (DLSU). In the same tweet thread, Candila elaborates on other incidents that “traumatized” his comrades…
As I went on to another collective, they were, coincidentally, [after they had “been accused, with clear and convincing evidence, of multiple sexual harassment cases”] moved to the same (instead of being imposed with harsher disciplinary sanctions). They have incessantly messaged me, convincing me to stay in the place where he also sleeps “to hang out.”
Eventually, another case also broke within our collective where they have groped our comrade while fucking asleep.
The fear that I have felt in that moment, too—the idea that if that was also me being convinced to sleep there to also be groped, appalls me.
According to his Medium profile, Solas is a “non binary filipino activist-researcher and a cultural worker” who prefers to be referred to using the pronouns “they” and “them”. “I write randomly about youth and people’s movement and initiatives, social economy, sustainable development and wellness,” Solas asserts.
And then there is Bin Balagtas. Twitter user “sher-anne” who, according to her Twitter profile, is Secretary-General of Kabataan Partylist Marikina in a tweet called Balagtas a “predator” who persistently invited her to “hook up”. She further tweets…
This could possibly be the Twitter account of Sher-Anne Rediang (Facebook profile here), a member of the University of the Philippines (UP) Samahang Linggwistika (fellowship of linguists).
One of the things that particularly infuriates woke “activists” is seeing their feelings “invalidated” by members of what they regard as the establishment. As “sher-anne” points out in a tweet, “parte na rin ng culture ng pang-iinvalidate sa concerns ng mga tao ang mapanguna ang teorya kaysa magprovide ng emotional support sa mga kasama” [translated to English: “part of this culture of invalidation of people’s concerns is the practice of prioritising theory over emotional support for our comrades”].
As such, “journalist and educator” Danny Arao, a member of the UP faculty, walks into the proverbial minefield. Arao in a tweet issues what could be interpreted as a defense of said “establishment”…
Arao adds further in a subsequent tweet, “Individual transgressions like [sexual harassment] may or may not be organizational responsibility. While we should be sensitive to the victims’ trauma, it’s still necessary to know the facts.” It is interesting to note that this nugget of wisdom comes from one of the members of a community that have a rich track record of being quick to “holding to account” entire governments and demonising their top-level heads over incidents perpetrated by underlings without deeming it “still necessary to know the facts” first.",Others
Opposition banking on ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s intervention due to hopeless 2022 prospects,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/opposition-banking-on-icc-prosecutor-fatou-bensoudas-intervention-due-to-hopeless-2022-prospects/,"I’d like to see the International Criminal Court (ICC) bring charges to Xi Jin Ping for what China is doing in Hong Kong. The ICC is supposed to be a court of last resort. But former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio lists in his Inquirer column “The ICC Prosecutor’s submission” today why the complementarity principle where the ICC can only prosecute crimes when a government is “unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution” isn’t applicable to the Philippines. He cites the Constitution which stipulates that, “the President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices” and that the Ombudsman is powerless against impeachable executives. He then writes…
In conclusion, under Philippine law and jurisprudence, Philippine authorities are clearly “unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution” of President Duterte for the alleged crimes he is being investigated by the ICC. Philippine authorities are “unable genuinely” to investigate or prosecute President Duterte for any crime of whatever nature while he remains in office. Thus, Philippines authorities cannot raise the complementarity rule as a defense before the ICC.
Carpio conveniently omits that the Philippines has withdrawn from the ICC for what it deems a violation of sovereignty given the country is not a failed state. It’s interesting to note that the US isn’t a signatory to the Rome statute and it doesn’t recognize the authority of the ICC. Why? The US has overtly or covertly initiated regime-change in several countries since the end of World War II. Some of these have resulted in long wars such as that in Afghanistan and Iraq. It has turned Libya into a failed state after it deposed Muammar Qaddafi.
The Opposition has been crowing about ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s recommendation since its release. The end is near for Duterte they say. Immunity from suit is a protection provided the head of state in any Constitution for obvious simple reasons. How, after all, can a President exercise his functions if he has to contend with cases filed against him by disgruntled citizens or members of the opposition? There is no such thing as good faith in politics. We have seen the weaponization of the impeachment provision in the Constitution. But the most glaring omission is the fact that the evidence submitted by Jude Sabio and Antonio Trillanes are news clippings and photographs of the fatalities in the drug war!
The hypocrisy is disturbing because if the basis is principle then why has no one filed a case against the New People’s Army (NPA), the terrorist arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), for the killings it has committed since 1968? The public uproar over the Absalon brothers murder by the NPA had the leftist-militant groups scrambling last week to control the damage from the resulting public relations nightmare. Whatever justification they cited wasn’t bought by the public. The other members of the Opposition did not condemn outright the actions of the CPP-NPA. The damage control is now at the stage where the leftist-militant groups are turning the tables by exposing the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) allegedly killing a group of indigenous peoples in Surigao for being NPA sympathizers.
Antonio Carpio is a lawyer and a former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The better question for him is this: Why does he have more sympathy for the drug pushers and addicts killed than the victims of the latter? The change in the peace and order situation in the whole country is palpable. The drug menace reached the point where the assessment of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) was that drugs were available in every barangay in the country. During the administration of former President Noynoy Aquino, riding-in-tandem shootings occurred on a daily basis. Rape, robbery and homicide were common fare on TV Patrol‘s nightly newscast. Shabu was being openly sold in neighborhood sari-sari stores. Thieves were stealing spare tires and side mirrors from vehicles parked on the streets. It was an unprecedented level of brazenness which prevailed and had ordinary Filipinos fearful of walking the streets.
The detachment from reality of the Opposition is evident. Carpio spearheads 1Sambayan which produced a spectacular flop last June 12. The problem with the Opposition is they have been so used to employing shortcuts to get back in power. Unfortunately for them, the advent of social media has made black propaganda campaigns less effective as they were during the previous administrations. Traditional media can spin news reports and op-ed pages but every citizen now has a voice.
It would do well for Carpio to listen to these voices. If the Opposition wants to defeat Duterte, they will have to do it legally at the ballot box. The hypocritical attitude with which they regard the definition of sovereignty in the Constitution is alarming. It shows that they have no respect for the rule of law. Mob rule isn’t an option for them at this point, because the numbers they have in their ranks isn’t enough to face the greater majority of the Filipino people who support the administration.",Others
The communists should PROVE their “remorse” for Absalon landmine deaths by turning themselves in,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/the-communists-should-prove-their-remorse-for-absalon-landmine-deaths-by-turning-themselves-in/,"It was enough of an atrocity that the terrorist arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New People’s Army (NPA), use landmines in the “revolution” they wage against the Filipino people. The, response from the CPP-NPA makes it worse. The tragedy in the unnecessary deaths of Far Easterner University (FEU) footballer Kieth Absalon and his cousin Nolven Absalon in an explosion of one such mines is evidently lost in CPP spokesman Marco Valbuena who only had this lame apology to issue in a tweet.
In a statement attached to the tweet as an image, Valbuena all but exhibited the utter hypocrisy of the CPP-NPA in the way he put his clearly un-shaken belief in the righteousness of the practice of their terrorism front and centre…
In waging a people’s war, the New People’s Army is always reminded to give the highest priority to the protection of civilian lives and property. In this regard, the Masbate incident should not have happened.
We are aware that an investigation is already being carried out by the Party’s Bicol Regional Committee and Masbate Provincial Committee of the Party and the higher commands of the NPA to identify the errors and weaknesses that led to this tragedy.
The lessons that will be drawn should guide the NPA to avoid such unfortunate incidents in the future and strengthen its resolve to serve and defend the people.
In (1) deferring to their own internal investigation and not to the only true authorities in criminal investigation — the Philippine police — and in (2) suggesting that this incident be a lesson “to avoid such unfortunate incidents in the future”, Valbuena effectively makes the CPP-NPA apology conditional. Valbuena clearly sticks to their crooked position that the CPP-NPA are above the law that the police are sworn to enforce and that they will continue their terrorist “revolution” over the “future” he foresees.
If, indeed, the CPP-NPA “take full responsibility”, the question should be asked: responsibility to who?
Under the law, one takes responsibility for a criminal act before a Philippine judge. If the CPP-NPA are sincere in their efforts to account for their crimes, they should submit to due process within the Philippines’ criminal justice system. Unless they do this, Valbuena’s words are just that — mere words.
A favourite template protest slogan we hear from these communists whenever they allege that a crime was committed against one of their own is the ol’ “Justice for [insert name of “victim” here]!” And so here we see the CPP-NPA with a perfect opportunity to practice what they preach. Under Philippine law, justice can only be meted out through a Philippine court following observation of due process. Justice for Kieth and Nolven Absalon.
Ball is in your court Mr. Valbuena and comrades. Prove to the Filipino people that you people are serious about taking full responsibility.",Others
Philippine Opposition bent on POLITICISING the Jonel Nuezca shooting incident,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/philippine-opposition-bent-on-politicising-the-jonel-nuezca-shooting-incident/,"As expected, the Opposition led by the Yellowtards (the block within it loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco clan) and the communists are seizing the opportunity to politicise the shooting incident that left Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio dead. The dishonest logic that underpins this politicisation campaign is all-too-familiar: (1) put up this isolated incident as sufficient sampling to make conclusions about the entire Philippine police force and (2) use this “indictment” to conclude that it is the fault of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that (2a) the Gregorio shooting happened and (2b) the Philippine police are “a bunch of killers”.
Deconstructed this way, it becomes quite evident how the Opposition are bent on propagating dishonest reasoning to further pre-determined political agendas. The pre-set agenda here, of course, is to make Duterte look bad (as a pretext to “oust” him illegally) and to make the police force look bad as a foundation for the victim porn that is the foundation of their crooked “activism”.
The reality is that there is no strong evidence that the perpetrator in this shooting, police officer Jonel Nuezca acted in a way that is necessarily representative of the character of the Philippine police. For one thing, the incident did not involve an actual police operation. Nuezca was not in uniform and no police procedures were evident in what transpired. The incident was seemingly an outcome of an altercation between two families possibly going back many months. Indeed, one of the people on the scene was also appealing to everyone that all keep calm until Barangay authorities arrive — indicating that Nuezca, despite being a police officer, was not regarded as the highest authority at the scene and was not working in collaboration with any police personnel.
In short, this is just another criminal case where the alleged perpetrator just happens to be a police officer.
Of course, understanding these simple bits of logic (or the specific circumstances of the incident where the logic of screeching Yellowtards and communists simply break down) will not easily assuage the shrill “activism” that the Opposition are engineering around it. Applying reason, after all, involves the use of a less inflammatory cognitive faculty than emotionalism. Unfortunately for everyone, however, the very “activism” of the Yellowtards and communists while pretending in intent to be cries for “justice”, will only degrade any opportunity to learn important lessons from this tragedy that will have contributed to sustainable rule of justice in the Philippines.
The fact is, the Gregorio shooting is a microcosm of Philippine society — a confluence of circumstances involving a bunch of morons coming together at the wrong time in the wrong place and everyone of these morons failing to know enough when to shut up.
If there really is a problem with the Philippine police, then, by all means, investigate that problem properly and act on the results of that investigation where appropriate. The shooting of Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio is a crime that also deserves to be investigated properly and, following that investigation, put through the criminal justice system. To politicise it subtracts from the justice the Gregorios deserve. It seems that the Yellowtards and communists would rather see their dishonest agendas furthered first as a matter of priority — exploiting this most recent tragedy to achieve a crooked political end even at the expense of the justice due the Gregorios.",Others
Communist publications @PinoyWeekly and @Bulatlat BANNED; discredited Opposition “journalists” scramble to their defense,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/06/communist-publications-pinoyweekly-and-bulatlat-banned-discredited-opposition-journalists-scramble-to-their-defense/,"Following an order issued by the Philippines’ National Security Council to block Internet access to “news sites allegedly linked to communist rebels”, various media groups and “journalists” associated with the Philippine Opposition and its communist allies are up in arms again invoking that all-too-familiar “attack on press freedom” trope. The cast of characters in this shrill outcry consist, of course, of the usual suspects…
The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) denounced the “arbitrary inclusion” of Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, and other independent news sites in a list of those tagged as being “affiliated to and are supporting” the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF).
The defense is rabid and dishonest, going to the extent of issuing blatant lies as Roby Alampay, “Founder, Chairman and Editor-at-Large of PumaPodcast” does in this tweet.
There is, contrary to Alampay’s assertion, ample evidence of links of these groups not just to the Communist Party of the Philippines but, more disturbingly, to its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army. We cited these links some time back in our article “Make no mistake. ‘Pinoy Weekly’ is a COMMUNIST publication!”. Evidence is in the public domain as both Altermidya and Pinoy Weekly exhibited no reservations taking credit for seemingly exclusive photos of armed NPA personnel…
Interestingly, this “legitimate” news organisation seems to have ready access to the Communist Party of the Philippines’ (CPP) terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA). In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.
Another photo featured in the same article showing crowds gathered for that same occassion with the iconic hammer and sickle logo of the world’s communists in full view is credited to the media advocacy Altermidya.
Articles in the Pinoy Weekly website authored by “Boy Bagwis” also exhibit photos that evidently put him in close contact with the NPA as this one featured in the article (title translated to English) “Revolution in the Southern Tagalog Continues” shows.
It is no wonder these “journalists” have been utterly discredited. They continue to insult Filipinos with their blatant lies and their presumption to unilaterally crown themselves the foremost “guardians of truth” of the land. Filipinos need to rid their politics of these vermin. What are noble causes and important advocacies are corrupted by dishonest “thought leaders” who use issues of national consequence to disguise an insidious mission to destroy democracy through violent “revolution”. Perhaps they may seem not as threatening as they once were — their “fighters” are more snowflake than guerrilla in appearance and their weapons more Apple than AK-47. If for anything, Filipinos should at least get rid of them because they insult Philippine democracy by suggesting that, despite the hard work of people who work within the legal frame, it is hopelessly broken. Philippine democracy is anything but broken. This is a fact that can be further re-enforced once Filipinos put their collective feet down and take back real activism from the communists and their “woke” Yellowtard allies.
“Media practitioners” who belong to leftist-militant media organizations such as Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, and Altermidya are included in the order of battle of the state because they incite sedition. The dishonest perception they aim to spin is that there is suppression of freedom of the press in the country when, in truth, there is none. The fact is, many take for granted the idea that these organisations are “news media” channels when, in reality, they are anything but. They are, when it comes down to it, no more than mere propaganda arms of an obsolete Cold War era “movement” that counts as its singular aim the overthrow through violent “revolution” any legitimately-elected Philippine government. Why must Filipinos continue to put up with these crooks? It looks Filipinos are now getting the answer they’ve long deserved.",Others
Communist Party of the Philippines founder Joma Sison is dead. GOOD RIDDANCE!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/communist-party-of-the-philippines-founder-joma-sison-is-dead-good-riddance/,"News broke this morning that Jose Maria Sison founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its terrorist arm the New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) is dead. He spent the last years of his life holed up in the Netherlands very likely fearing for his life even as his comrades sowed terror across his home country’s hinterlands.
Sison continues to be regarded as the spiritual and thought leader of a bandit movement that seeks to destroy Philippine democracy through “armed revolution” and establish a “dictatorship of the proletariat” in the Philippines.
Along with the National Democratic Front (NDF) and the terrorist New People’s Army (NPA) Sison cited as essential to complementing his so called “armed revolution” the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (“New Nationalist Alliance” or “BAYAN”).  He also cited Gabriela, the “women’s alliance”, the League of Filipino Students (LFS), and the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) among others as also being part of this coalition of legal fronts that aim to collaborate towards the overthrow any legitimate Philippine government.
Various media organisations also operate with impunity within Sison’s crooked “revolutionary” umbrella. “Legitimate” news organisations Pinoy Weekly and Altermidya, for example, seem to have ready access to the inner sanctum of the CPP-NPA. In the 2017 article “Five Reasons Why the World’s Longest Communist Revolution is Still Going Strong”, a photo showing what look like armed combatants in “full battle gear” in formation as part of an event marking the anniversary of the CPP is credited to a certain “Boy Bagwis of Pinoy Weekly”.

It is clear that the CPP-NPA is an enemy of the Philippine state and the late Joma Sison was its leader. Who will replace him now? More importantly, will any of the “activist” personalities associated with his “legal front” organisations mourn his death openly?

Making sense of Jonel Nuezca’s senseless killing of Sonya and Frank Anthony Gregorio,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2020/12/making-sense-of-jonel-nuezcas-senseless-killing-of-sonya-and-frank-anthony-gregorio/,"It is easy to watch a viral video of the most recent police “killing” then jump into a “conclusion” that the Philippine police are “evil” and then go off to launch a whole media circus around it and propagate the latest outrage fad. The incident that left Sonya Gregorio and her son Frank Anthony Gregorio dead is a tragedy, but not necessarily one that allows anyone to soundly arrive at the conclusion that the Philippine National Police is an “evil” institution. But that’s exactly what the Philippine Opposition are fooling the Filipino people into believing.
This common sense regard for the crime perpetrated by police officer Jonel Nuezca did not stop the Philippine Opposition from politicising this incident beyond recognition. For the Yellowtards (the leading bloc within the Opposition loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) and the communists, any position that is short of broadly painting the Philippine police as “evil” constitutes a “downplaying” of the public outrage this issue is entitled to. According to their “thought leaders”, people who attempt to point out the logical unsoundness of the notion that a duly-elected Philippine president deserves to be “ousted” as a result of these crimes deserves to be ridiculed as someone who is walang pakisama — a person who refuses to conform to a sentiment that is regarded to be right on the dubious merit of popular opinion alone.
The trouble with the Yellowtards and the communists lies in their overused partisan tradition. Both camps are renowned primarily for their “ouster” rhetoric — a tradition of using “mass action” and dishonestly packaging these as “revolutions” to further political agendas. As such, they are now known for their utterly devalued political modus operandi, forever scrounging around for isolated incidents as fodder for the outrage fads they are always looking to spark. Complementing this tactic is their blanket campaign to demonise state forces — the police and military — who are, in actual fact, the only forces capable of thwarting violent terrorist acts (in the case of the communist intent) or swinging an ouster campaign towards or away from success (in the case of the Yellowtard intent). If the top “thought leaders” of the Opposition could only be bothered to reflect on their tired approach to “change”, they will find that their style is succumbing to the law of diminishing returns — more is delivering incrementally less and less.
No surprise then that no critical gaps, dysfunctions, or opportunities in administration and governance are intelligently addressed in the Philippines in a sustainable manner. The problems that are at the centres of the Yellowtards’ and communists’ phony and pretentious rages are all problemns that transcend many governments. Police brutality, corruption, election cheating, nepotism, etcetera — all endemic with no one government addressing them at the systemic level. Yet here, yet again, we see the same tired old partisan camps armed with their obsolete ideologies and rhetoric packaging these as issues “unique” to the incumbent government they are railing against. One can only hope that these crooks can get away with this strategic insult to the intelligence of the Filipino people for only so long. Indeed, it is beginning to look like Filipinos have had enough of heated and re-heated inadobong Yellowtardism and communism year in and year out, president in and president out.
The brain-dead pattern is now quite readily recognisable. Crooked partisan groups like the Yellowtards and communists are always hovering around like vultures ready to feast on and regurgitate into their bankrupt political rhetoric any incident or idea that could be used as a tool for mass emotional blackmail. It leads one to question whether these people are genuinely looking for solutions, because it is quite evident that they only seek to escalate emotionalism at the expense of systematic thinking in order to cultivate fertile ground for “revolution”.
The sense in the killing of the Gregorios does not go beyond the criminal case and the hopeful resolution following due process via the criminal justice system ensrhined within the frame of the Consititution. If we are to mature as a society, this case-to-case address of acute incidents and their resolution within institutional measures should be made a habit — because measures that enforce systematic approaches to resolving issues are designed to ensure sound conclusions are reached upon which appropriate actions are taken. When deliberate action is always taken to escalate emotional responses around every incident, there will be no sound resolution and no incentive to focus on clear thinking. This is why, for example, the jeepney remains the social cancer that it is today in the Philippines. The contraption represents a triumph of haphazard emotion over engineered solutions. As long as Filipinos are encouraged by cancerous political blocs like the Yellowtards and communists to habitually apply emotional responses to problems that can routinely be solved by clear thinking (a discipline that any mature criminal justice system enforces), they will not progress.",Others
Filipinos stuck in a country where divorce is illegal and bank secrecy allows crooks to stash dirty cash,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/filipinos-stuck-in-a-country-where-divorce-is-illegal-and-bank-secrecy-allows-crooks-to-stash-dirty-cash/,"Divorce and the Philippines again landing in the gray list of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) go hand in hand even if the issues are diametrically opposed. Why is this? Both issues involve the pockets of our honorable legislators in Congress. The Philippines is only one of two states in the world where divorce is still banned, the other being the Vatican. The latter’s reason for not legalizing divorce is obvious. In the Philippines, it’s still illegal because we have prominent politicians with extended families. Divorce would be a pain in their pockets because it gives their legitimate wives enough reason to leave them and get financial support in the process.
Emmeline Aglipay-Villar writing for the PhilSTAR points out…
The Family Code has long acknowledged the power of the courts to declare as null marriages that were void or voidable from the start. Unlike a divorce, in which it is recognized that a marriage took place, a declaration of nullity means these “marriages” never took place at all. For the most part, the grounds for nullity have nothing to do with the inner qualities of the persons involved.
The primary exception to this (other than deficiencies of consent) is the ground of psychological incapacity. If you were married to a person who was incapable of carrying out the essential obligations of marriage – say, a pathological liar unable to distinguish truth from fiction – the only ground you could use to expect relief from the courts would be psychological incapacity.
The motivation is the same in their reluctance to pass amendments to the bank secrecy law. Our politicos are extremely protective of their bank accounts for obvious reasons. It would make anti-corruption efforts a lot easier and it would also get us off the gray list of the FATF. Recall the hack on the New York Federal Reserve Bank where cash held in trust for the government of Bangladesh was wired to the country through the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) and then disappeared into the abyss? The most recent scandal is that of Wirecard, a German financial payments company which went bankrupt whose officials were found to have deposits in excess of $2.1 billion in two Philippine banks. This again landed the country in the gray list of the FATF.
Bank secrecy is valued by fraudsrers, drug lords and terrorists because it enables them to move cash legitimately. For everything else, there’s Bitcoin. We are at the mercy of these “honorables” for the simple reason that they are protecting their own interests. Not ours. In the meantime, the reputation of the country and our financial system, suffers. The same is true for women who are caught in dead-end marriages. Not only do they lose out on opportunities for fresh starts, they also have to beg for support from their husbands who have moved on with other women.
We are in a quandary because our legislators will never work against their interests. Though we don’t run the risk of becoming a financial pariah, the country’s image as a foreign investment destination suffers. Unfortunately, we don’t have any future congressmen in the horizon who are morally-upright. They are in Congress because they want a share of the spoils. And so we continue to be stuck and be subject to their whims and caprices. All for the betterment of their collective pockets.",Others
Manny Pacquiao’s cheap talk on government corruption won’t solve it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/07/manny-pacquiaos-cheap-talk-on-government-corruption-wont-solve-it/,"I waited for Senator Manny”Pac-Man” Pacquiao’s exposé on corruption in various government agencies before writing about what I experienced about corruption in government at the level of a public educational institution. Corrupt government employees are socio-psychopaths. Most of them have a distorted sense of values. They’re engaged in corrupt practices but like to think they’re doing the institution they’re part of a lot of good. It’s about the image they have of themselves in their heads and what they project.
The Vice-President for Administration and Finance in that institution was clearly not qualified for her post. Why? Her undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Arts. Her postgraduate degrees had nothing to do with either administration or finance. But she was very close to a former Mayor with a one syllable surname. She was slated to become the President of the institution but didn’t get the appointment because her political patron lost in the election. Her group was the largest faction in the institution. They had the most rackets going under the supervision of their syndicate members but it was hard to get evidence because she controlled the two divisions where the evidence could be found.
Another form of corruption is the promotion of unqualified individuals by non-adherence to human resource actions under the Civil Service Code. You have a situation where you have full-time faculty members who are inarticulate. An example is a faculty member whose undergraduate degree is Architecture with a Master’s degree in Public Administration teaching Physical Education. Inarticulation is prohibited by both the Civil Service Commission and the Commission on Higher Education.
Then you have the money-making ventures such as the pocketing of tuition and other fees for off-campus programs under the graduate school. The “package” includes a ready-made thesis with a passing grade. These are offered to government employees who have to continue with their education in order to qualify for the next higher plantilla position. It used to be that there would be no increase in pay without a promotion but the salary standardization law corrected this error with annual step increases based on the formula provided for.
In a local city university where everything is supposed to be provided for free, students are asked to pay for ID cards, Physical Education (PE) and National Service Training Program (NSTP) uniforms, the purchase of textbooks written by faculty members themselves, food and drink from a canteen concessionaire whose patrons hold office at City Hall. There is also the improper disbursement of grants from Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and other non-goverment organisations (NGOs) or aid organizations.
Most employees aren’t qualified for their jobs either. Those who don’t have civil service eligibility are lumped into Administrative Aide I and II positions. Their income is augmented by having them take post-graduate studies in the same institution where they are sure to pass. Upon “completion” of their studies, they then become part-time instructors in minor subjects such as NSTP. Their teaching loads augment the low pay from their plantilla positions. The employees who try to expose these corrupt practices usually become pariahs. They are the object of white paper exposés sent to the gods at City Hall. Each college’s Dean and his faculty members also have rackets going on specially in Health Sciences, Engineering and Criminology.
If you’re wondering why public education is in such a sorry state, this is why. But the rot doesn’t end there. The rot has reached private educational institutions as well. This is why our students have fallen behind Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings. Just the other day, it was a World Bank study which called attention to the deteriorating situation in the education sector. Even if you have the evidence, filing the case and seeing it through at the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan is a tedious process. Just look at the cases filed by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) against the Marcos cronies as an example.
In short, it’s easy to say that there is corruption in government but it is hard to prove. While I don’t begrudge the effort of Pac-Man, it’s clear that his is not a sincere effort but more of catching the public’s attention for his political plans. Minimizing corruption in government needs a radical solution. Digitization is the solution but given the size of the bureaucracy and our political structure, it’s hard to implement it. It is easier to replace the bureaucracy wholesale than pursue cases against the guilty. This is why we should not be fooled by motherhood statements coming from candidates for 2022. They need to have a specific plan of action. Otherwise, talk is cheap and evidence is not easy to collect.",Others
"Twitter shut down @realDonaldTrump, so it should also shut down the CPP-NPA’s @prwc_info account",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/twitter-shut-down-realdonaldtrump-so-it-should-also-shut-down-the-cpp-npas-prwc_info-accont/,"Only fair, right? The basis of Twitter recently shutting down the account of United States president Donald Trump is “due to the risk of further incitement of violence” that it presumably exposes the American public to.
Twitter references its policy on the nature of such behaviour and the actions it holds prerogative to take on users who violate it. On a blog posted specific to the action it took against the US president it reiterates, “we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.”
That same blog also cites Twitter’s Glorification of Violence policy…
We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”.
The policy stipulates that included as violations are tweets that glorify, praise, condone, or celebrate “attacks carried out by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups (as defined by our terrorism and violent extremism policy)”.
As such, this draws attention to overdue consideration of the tweets being fielded by the Communist Party of the Philippines through its account @prwc_info where it glorifies the activities of its terrorist arm, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Just one example of the impunity with which the CPP-NPA routinely glorifies its terrorist activities is in this recent tweet…
Indeed, a Stanford University report describes the history and capacity for deadly violence of the NPA and its combatants…
In February 1971, [CPP founder Jose Maria] Sison met with CPP-NPA Central Committee members to discuss his plan to attack a Manila rally of the Liberal Party, which opposed President Marcos. The purpose of the attack was to provoke another government crackdown and ideally gain support for the CPP-NPA. On August 21, three CPP-NPA members threw four grenades onstage at the rally in Manila’s Plaza Miranda before fleeing the city to a CPP-NPA camp.
The same Stanford report describes current party-list group Bayan Muna as “a political party connected to the CPP and other groups in the Communist movement.” According to an ABS-CBN News report Bayan Muna is part of the Makaybayan bloc of left-leaning party-lists that include “Gabriela, Kabataan, Anakpawis, Migrante, and Alliance of Concerned Teachers.”
So did Twitter act fairly when it “permanently suspended” the account of the President of the United States? Perhaps yes, though I did elaborate on the implications of such an act when I posed the question earlier; Should Twitter and Facebook block Donald Trump? However, to be truly regarded as fair, Twitter should act fairly and consider all accounts that issue tweets that could be regarded as acts of inciting insurrection and glorifying violence.",Others
Islamic TERRORIST group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front supports Leni Robredo,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/04/islamic-terrorist-group-the-moro-islamic-liberation-front-supports-leni-robredo/,"A disturbing image was tweeted by Al Jazeera correspondent Jameela Alindogan today showing what appears to be a heavily-armed fighter of the Islamic terrorist group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) posing next to a campaign poster of Opposition Yellowtard candidate and “vice president” Leni Robredo.
It would indeed be interesting to understand what exactly the position the Robredo camp takes with regard to the MILF. The MILF and the older more moderate Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) go way back. The origins of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front as a militant breakaway group from what was once considered a more “moderate” MNLF was over disagreements with the direction being taken by the MNLF leadership back in 1977 towards renouncing its own separatist agenda in favour of a more “conciliatory” deal with Manila then, a direction which bore fruit ten years later for the MNLF.
In January 1987, the MNLF signed an agreement relinquishing its goal of independence for Muslim regions and accepting the government’s offer of autonomy. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the next largest faction, refused to accept the accord and initiated a brief offensive that ended in a truce later that month. By one estimate the Mindanao-based Moro Islamic Liberation Front fielded around 3,000 troops.
The MILF are responsible for the massacre of 44 elite officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Special Action Force (SAF) in 2015. The final report of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Board of Inquiry (BOI) organised to investigate this massacre is available and can be downloaded from the official PNP website here. The massacre transpired in the midst of the execution of “Oplan” Exodus personally overseen by then president Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III which aimed to “neutralize high value targets (HVTs)” consisting of international terrorists wanted by the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
The atrocity prompted the Philippine Army to wage an “all-out war” against the MILF and, at the time had highlighted a fundamental fear along these lines…
The military fears Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) might mingle with Moro Islamic Liberation Front members to elude pursuing Philippine Army troopers in Central Mindanao.
Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines public affairs office, said one of the challenges in the all-out offensive against the BIFF was the possibility both rebel groups might reunite. The BIFF is a breakaway group of the [Moro Islamic Liberation Front] which is nearing a peace agreement with the government.
In short, the Philippines and its people, from a military perspective, have only one strategic enemy — bad armed men who kill people in an organised manner in the name of a movement or religion.
How do the members of the campaign team of Robredo feel about being supported by this nefarious terrorist group? An answer to that question is not likely to be forthcoming considering the Yellowtards’ track record of being tight-lipped when it comes to glaring inconsistencies in the underlying ideology of their dishonest “movement”. As such, one can only wait in hope that the truth is out there somewhere. For now, abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Others
‘Pork Barrel Queen’ Janet Lim Napoles convicted but the buck stopped with Aquino in 2013,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/pork-barrel-queen-janet-lim-napoles-convicted-but-the-buck-stopped-with-aquino-in-2013/,"After years of muddling through the Philippines’ “justice” system, some progress in the crackdown on pork barrel politics has finally been made. Janet Lim Napoles now reportedly faces “jail time of 12 to 18 years for each count of malversation” after the Sandiganbayan ruled  “Napoles, [former Cagayan de Oro representative Constantino Jaraula], and three others […] guilty of committing three counts of graft and three counts malversation charges for pocketing at least P19.2 million of the lawmaker’s Priority Development Assistance Fund allocation”.
But is that the end of what the Philippines’ National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) described as “the mother of all scams” back in 2013? At the time, the estimate of what was allegedly stolen was nothing short of enormous. Allegations that up to Php10 billion was siphoned off by a syndicate into dummy firms rocked the foundations of both chambers of Philippine Congress back then. Linked to the scandal were no less than five senators and 23 congressmen. Was it a racket knowingly or unwittingly participated in by the 28 law makers? That still remains to be determined.
The news first broke in the Inquirer.net which over a four-part series of articles revealed the extent of the scam allegedly perpetrated by a certain Janet Lim Napoles, CEO of trading firm JLN Corporation. The series of stories ran by the Inquirer.net are as follows (key excerpts quoted for each):
NBI probes P10-B scam (Fri, 12 Jul 2013)
JLN stands for Janet Lim Napoles, who has been identified as the alleged brains behind the racket. She runs the company with her brother, Reynald “Jojo” Lim.
The sworn affidavits—prepared by six whistle-blowers with the assistance of their lawyer, Levito Baligod, and submitted to the NBI—stated that JLN Corp., with offices on the 25th floor of Discovery Suites in Ortigas Center in Pasig City, had defrauded the government of billions of pesos in ghost projects involving the creation of at least 20 bogus nongovernment organizations. These NGOs were supposedly the ultimate recipients of the state funds, but the money went to Napoles, according to the affidavits of the six whistle-blowers.
‘I am not involved in any scam’ (Sat, 13 Jul 2013)
Janet Lim-Napoles, who first appeared on the radar screen of whistle-blowers in 2001, has dismissed as a “product of lies,” allegations she engineered a P10-billion scam over the past decade using mainly pork barrel funds of senators and congressmen for ghost projects.
In an affidavit prepared by the MOST law firm, the 49-year-old trader said she and her company, JLN Corp., had “never transacted business or closed deals with the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.”
“I certainly was not involved in any of the high-profile scams which occurred during the previous administration,” she said […]
How P10-B racket works (Sun, 14 Jul 2013)
The scheme involved the Malampaya funds, the fertilizer fund and the lawmakers’ allotments from the priority development assistance fund (PDAF), or pork barrel.
[…]
Napoles and her company had been trading agricultural products since 2000 until she reportedly discovered in 2003 a quicker scheme to make money, her former employees said in interviews and affidavits submitted to the National Bureau of Investigation, which is looking into her activities.
For such a high-stakes racket, the modus operandi was surprisingly simple, the INQUIRER has learned.
Napoles, who allegedly ran the racket from unit 2502 of Discovery Suites in Ortigas Center, Pasig City, established foundations or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to serve as recipients of the funds and named her own employees, including a nanny, as presidents of these outfits.
The funds, which were deposited in the foundations’ bank accounts, were eventually remitted to her to be split between her and the lawmaker whose PDAF allotment was used, or the official of the state agency involved.
28 solons linked to scam (Mon, 15 Jul 2013)
Sen. Ramon “Bong” Revilla Jr. topped the list of lawmakers who were said to have allowed the use of their Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) to the scheme allegedly hatched by Janet Lim-Napoles, president and CEO of the trading firm JLN Corp., according to the documents secured by the Inquirer.
Revilla gave the syndicate access to his PDAF, or pork barrel, to dummy NGOs formed by Napoles and registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission in 22 instances; followed by Senators Juan Ponce Enrile on 21 occasions; Jinggoy Estrada, 18 times; Ferdinand Marcos Jr., four; and Gringo Honasan, once with a small amount.
[…]
Topping the list of 23 House representatives is Rizalina Seachon-Lanete of Masbate’s third district, who allowed her pork to be used 13 times; followed by Conrado Estrella III of Pangasinan’s 6th district and Rodolfo Plaza of Agusan del Sur, both nine occasions; and Samuel Dangwa, of Benguet, eight.
Interestingly, pork barrel funds have long been seen to be an obvious source of corruption in Philippine politics. Under the pork barrel system, each senator enjoys an allocation of P200 million from the national budget while each member of the House of Representatives receives P70 million. Each one has full authority to decide how these funds are used to “assist” their respective constituencies. Because Malacañang has control over the formulation of the national budget and the release of the PDAF allocation included in the budget, some influence over the behaviour of members of Congress can be exerted by the President.
As Neal Cruz pointed out in his piece on the issue…
I am sure that President Aquino, the self-proclaimed nemesis of graft and corruption, has again submitted to Congress a budget for next year that includes the hated PDAF.
Why do the presidents do it? Because it is a means of making the legislators do what the president wants. Cooperative legislators get their pork allocations quickly; uncooperative ones don’t get theirs as quickly. The pork is a sort of carrot-and-stick for the legislators. In short, the pork is a bribe by the President to members of Congress. Because of the pork, presidents, including President Aquino, are guilty of bribery.
Clearly, this pork barrel “scam” is a product of a systemic issue within which Napoles was but one cog in a vast kleptocratic clockwork. The deeply-institutionalised thievery that is Philippine-style pork barrel politics has the following key components in its gravy train:
The President of the Philippines – who formulates the National Budget and consistently includes the pork barrel as a significant chunk of it year in and year out.
Philippine Congress – the state body that, amazingly, approves the National Budget, a big chunk of which involves the very funds that end up in its members’ secret bank accounts.
The Philippines’ financial system – a black-box conduit for mob funds that is hopelessly convoluted by archaic secrecy laws, lax and corrupt regulatory bodies, and tight family ties (many with links to the very law enforcement offices currently “investigating” this case) that greases the cogs.
Where did Napoles fit in the above?
Whatever the answer to that question is does not really matter. She is all but one item in what should have been a long list of persons of interest in this case — perhaps one that likely included bank executives, NGO managers and sponsors, senators and House representatives, and last but certainly not the least, then President Benigno Simeon “BS” Aquino III himself. The latter is where the buck stopped as the old cliche goes. BS Aquino, after all, was the man who submitted the National Budget proposal and, as such, was the ultimate originator of the pork barrel allocations to begin with. This is the very same man who back in 2010 prematurely trumpeted his place in history as the country’s unprecedented Corruption Killer. Midway through his term, it had become evident that Aquino was living up to his two-letter initials.
Grace Pulido-Tan, then chairman of the Commission on Audit, in a media conference she called shortly after releasing their audit report on Congress’s use of pork barrel funds confirmed what Filipinos had long suspected — that the national scam is deeply systemic to governance in the country and far far bigger than “the Janet Lim Napoles issue”…
Pressed to capture in one word what the special audit – on pork barrel releases from 2007 to 2009 – found, Pulido-Tan replied: “Kahindik-hindik.” In English, “Disgusting”.
Pulido-Tan said the misuse of the billions became possible because of a combination of corruption and the failure of national government agencies, lawmakers’ offices, and lapses by the Department of Budget and Management itself, which did not follow its own rules in some cases. She also said there was widespread disregard for rules that appeared loose to begin with.
Confirmed too was the role media plays in engineering confusion and misguidance in the public in order to protect politicians who happen to bask in Big Media’s favour or demonise people so that they serve as decoys and distractions to the real issues surrounding pork barrel thievery. Media watchdog Spin Busters, for one, examined the details of the COA report and noted how legislators who had worked closely with Malacañang had been conveniently left out in the “exposés” and “scoops” issued in recent weeks by the country’s major news organisations.
[Iloilo Rep. Niel] Tupas [who was chief prosecutor in the impeachment trial against former Chief Justice Renato Corona] was tagged by COA in questionable NGO deals worth P542 million along with fellow BS Aquino BFF, Joel Villanueva, now the head of TESDA. Also, Edgardo Angara, father of Sonny Angara, who won a Senate seat on the Yellow ticket last May. COA was deeply suspicious of old man Angara’s P81.55-million financial assistance to a pet NGO and a P14-million feeding program with another NGO where he’s, uhm, an incorporator. That looks like the Napoles business model: cultivate a cottage industry of paper NGOs and monopolize the pork barrel pipeline.
Funny how quickly the tables turn on the sneaky business that is Philippine “journalism” as Spin Busters observed back then…
Now that COA chief Grace Pulido-Tan let the cat out of the bag, [the Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) is] forced to report about the widening scope of the pork scam. Thanks to Gil Cabacungan, even if his reputation precedes him, for incessantly pitching the story about BS cabinet exec Proceso Alcala’s own meat processing operation to a PDI newsdesk that’s always looked the other way.
Don’t be surprised about the apparent PDI “news management,” one that contains the damage to Napoles and steers clear of President BS buddies. Whoever leaked the story to PDI editors (who eventually assigned the writing to the brilliant and no-strings-attached Carvajal) sure had his own news management in mind and specific, laser-focused targets for the exposé.
On exhibit was how the erstwhile “heroes” of 1980s “people power” mythology — the supposedly “free” Philippine press, and certain yellow-shirted senators and congressmen — simply could not be trusted. Thus 2013 became the beginning of the end of the credibility of Big Corporate News Media in the Philippines.
In hindsight, we did not need Janet Lim Napoles to put the “scam” in the Great “PDAF Scam” of 2013. The Priority Development Assistance Fund had always been a scam. Filipinos were just too dumb to realise it over the last three decades. Indeed, the pork barrel, like the country’s jeepney infestation, are products of short-sighted populist politics. Both are products of wrong arguments that have been allowed to win for too long by a people not exactly renowned for arguing intelligently.
It does not take political “experts” to see that the whole point in being a duly-elected legislator is to ensure that constituencies are well-represented when crafting laws. They should leave the execution of those laws (and the use of public funds to do so) to the Executive Branch. That is why said branch is named as such.
Trying to “fix pork without hurting those who really need it” is like trying to modernise public transport without abolishing the jeepney. Change always hurts. Only people who lack imagination and routinely face the future with a pathetic lack of courage aspire for painless change. And so the question remains. Will the conviction of Janet Lim Napoles really make any difference in the bigger scheme of things? I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for the preferred answer to that question.",Others
“Red tagging” is an intellectually-dishonest red herring communists use to mask their crimes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/02/red-tagging-is-an-intellectually-dishonest-red-herring-communists-use-to-mask-their-crimes/,"Shhhh…. Listen for a minute in silence. Do you hear that? That’s right. That’s the sound of Filipino “activists” still complaining about being “red tagged”. In fact, it’s the only argument they throw against efforts being mounted by the Philippine Government to eradicate the communist cancer from our society. But think about it for a minute and ask:
What exactly does it mean to be “red tagged”?
For one thing, communists identify themselves using the colour red. So what’s the problem with being “red tagged”, right? Second, very few Filipinos will dispute allegations that “progressive” groups like Anakbayan, Gabriela, the Kilusang Mayo Uno, the League of Filipino Students, Bayan Muna, and the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) whose members enjoy absolute editorial control over university “journalism”, among others, are all barely-legal fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). As such, all of them are, by association, sympathetic to the goals of the terrorist arm of the CPP, the New People’s Army (NPA).
Thirdly, there is something intellectually-dishonest about summarily labelling an effort to investigate and crackdown on illegal activities as “red tagging”. Filipino communists are using this label as a curtain to obscure objective examination of details pertinent to really understanding the problem of the Philippines’ communist infestation at the right level. There is a hypothesis being tested here — that personalities accused of “being CPP card-bearing members” that “have been involved in some way in the armed rebellion” are engaged in activities that pose a danger to Filipino citizens. This is the simple position of the Philippine Government on the matter as articulated by National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Insurgency (NTF-ELCAC) spokesperson, Southern Luzon Command chief Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade reported by the Inquirer back in late January. Clearly, the government continues to gather evidence and connect the dots — part and parcel of business-as-usual intelligence work.
For Parlade, NPA members who surrendered to the government could prove it. He said ex-rebels pinpointed several members of above-ground groups as CPP-NPA members, including Colmenares.
“It’s not for me to decide on the cases but I have been involved in the discussions, that’s why I know that the evidence we have can implicate them. The testimonies of former rebels from Negros, from which he (Colmenares) is from also have a huge bearing. So how will evade that, those are former rebels who were with him in scouting and planning?” he pointed out.
Parlade admits that pursuit of the banking angle is still in its early stages but progressing nontheless.
“Bank accounts, it’s hard to establish bank accounts but that’s on the process, well AMLC is in charge here, but there are movements of money. You know the deposits, they just amount to around $100 to $200, that’s coming from abroad, then they will close the account, and then open it again,” Parlade claimed.
“That’s what happened to the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines and the Belgian NGOs. Who are the beneficiaries of these accounts? It’s Gabriela. Now, who [is] accepting these funds?  Well, not all go to the Communist Party of the Philippines, NPA, but a good 60 percent goes to the CPP-NPA. And these are all corroborated by these former rebels, especially those involved in the financial transactions of the CPP,” he added.
The astounding thing to be noted about this exercise is in how, outside of these government efforts, nobody in the Opposition seems the least bit curious about investigating whether there actually is a fire that accounts for all this smoke. And this is the point that needs to be highlighted here — that it is the job of the military to act on intelligence in much the same way that the police are duty-bound to investigate every instance where a crime may have occurred.
Bayan Muna chair and former Rep. Neri Colmenares, would rather be defensive than be supportive of fact finding. His approach is to introduce a political red herring to the argument — one that paints his lot as “victims” of a conspiracy to deny them their right to participate in the national debate.
Colmenares thinks that silencing critics and making them think twice about voicing concerns and opinions – and eventually kicking the carping Makabayan bloc out of office – is a way to weaken the opposition before the 2022 national elections.
“One of the reasons why they’ve been planning to Red-tag is because dissent and criticisms are mounting, so they need a more active tagging […] to stifle (dissent).  That’s the real intention of Red-tagging, it has been going on since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, to silence critics as you would stay quiet after being Red-tagged,” Colmenares said in Filipino.
“The second purpose of Red-tagging based on our analysis, the reason why it seems to be on the rise recently because the elections are near. And I think, our analysis here, they are concerned that their candidates are not faring well in the survey, if there are surveys going out, it does not represent their actual candidates,” he added.
Colmenares even suggests that “red tagging” is to blame for the catastrophic loss the Opposition camp suffered in the 2019 mid-term elections where every one of the eight bets in their “Otso Diretso” coalition failed to bag a Senate seat.
According to Colmenares, he and members of Otso Diretso – the opposition senatorial slate of the Liberal Party and its allied groups in the 2019 elections – were subjected to Red-tagging even before the campaign. But allegations died down eventually, which Colmenares took as indicative of electoral propaganda.
He thinks the accusations had an effect on the fate of the opposition, as none of the opposition bets – Otso Diretso or not – made it to the Senate.
Note that nothing in what Colmenares contributes to the conversation addresses any of the facts or investigative angles that Parlade shares and invites all to examine. Colmenares’s arguments are all appeals to victimhood designed to muddy rather than clarify the facts and arguments pertinent to the case.
One thing is clear, however. The buzzword “red tagging” is just another one of the old Cold War era ululations that communists use to keep all conversation about the Philippines’ communist problem muddied and assure themselves the breathing space they need to continue their illicit activities in the country’s university campuses and in the countryside. It has since been revealed to be obsolete and an ineffective propaganda tool. Filipinos are getting better at seeing through the dishonesty of the CPP-NPA and the circle of “activists” they surround themselves with in their futile efforts to come across as legitimate partners of the Filipino people in real nation building.",Others
Leni Robredo stands by position on 2022 election “cheating” despite admitting a lack of evidence to support it,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2022/12/leni-robredo-stands-by-position-on-2022-election-cheating-despite-admitting-a-lack-of-evidence-to-support-it/,"Was Leni Robredo cheated out of a win she and her supporters felt entitled to in this year’s national elections? Well, here it is straight from the horses mouth…
We participated in all the third party audits that were conducted, and our lawyers and our computer experts did not see anything. Ayaw po namin na mag-file ng kaso na papaasahin lang kayo
[Tagalog part translated to English: “We do not want to file a case lest to we keep your hopes up unnecessarily.”]
Seven months after the May 9 elections, former vice president Leni Robredo says she did not file an electoral protest because her legal team and group of IT experts did not find evidence of cheating.

Yet, as early as May this year, even the pro-Yellowtard Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) had reportedly stated that “it has not encountered discrepancies in the vote tabulation being conducted at its command center on the University of Santo Tomas campus in Manila.” Much of the noise around allegations of cheating came from the usual suspects such as communist-affiliated group Kontra Daya which, despite all evidence to the contrary, was adamant in its position on the matter back then…
“From our end, we can say, if we are asked: Was there election fraud? Yes, there was election fraud,” Malou Jarabe of Kontra Daya said during her presentation.
In an all-too-familiar application of that world-renowned Robredo “logic”, the former “vice president” further asserted…
Hindi ko po sinasabing walang dayaan na nangyari. Ang sinasabi ko lang, walang nakita. Walang nakita ‘yong ating mga teams
[Translated: “I did not say no cheating transpired. I’m saying no evidence was found. No evidence was found by our teams…”]
Coming from a supposed lawyer, an insistence that evidence plays second fiddle to personal opinion is borderline oxymoronic.
It is worth noting that back in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential elections when Robredo allegedly beat rival Bongbong Marcos to the vice presidency amid blatant anomalies under the watch of then Commission on Elections chair Andy Bautista, Robredo was disinclined to lift a finger on the matter of mounting evidence of electoral fraud. Worse, Robredo’s camp back then were quick to issue defensive statements whenever these allegations were raised such as when it was reportedly found that “38 out of 40 opened ballot boxes from Bato, Camarines Sur, had missing audit logs”.
Robredo lawyer Romulo Macalintal said the ballot box could have been exposed to a storm in Bato, Camarines Sur.
Macalintal also said the punctured ballot box found at the start of the recount could have been damaged after being thrown around by handlers in the PET warehouse.
Therein lies further proof of the selective and arbitrary nature of Robredo’s regard for justice. It also reveals her utter lack of a sense of personal accountability for the catastrophic loss her camp suffered in an election deemed “important” by the broader Opposition she presumes to lead.",Others
Death of PAL flight attendant Christine Dacera sparks torrent of spurious outrage on social media,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/death-of-pal-flight-attendant-christine-dacera-sparks-torrent-of-spurious-outrage-on-social-media/,"As expected, the story of the alleged rape and death of Philippine Airlines flight attendant (FA) Christine Dacera (reportedly on New Year’s Eve) is making waves on social media. Fuelling the rage are the seeming circumstances surrounding Dacera’s death. According to news sources, she was the only female participant in a party held in a room at the City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City. Of the men who attended the party, only three were Dacera’s actual friends with the rest either acquaintances or friends of friends. The Inquirer reports…
The unconscious Christine Angelica Dacera, 23, of General Santos City, was found in an empty bathtub of a hotel room where she and some friends celebrated New Year’s eve. She was later declared dead at a hospital.
Makati City police chief Col. Harold Depositar told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that a provisional charge of rape with homicide was filed Monday against 11 persons who were with Dacera, occupying two adjacent hotel rooms in Makati City, at the time of her death.
As of this writing, autopsy findings and toxicology reports are still pending and investigations are ongoing. The possibility that Dacera was raped and had died of trauma from that alleged rape are based on circumstantial evidence and injuries found on her body by medical examiners. However, none of these bits of information had been placed in a timeline as yet. According to Makati City police chief Col. Harold Depositar, “Dacera’s death may have initially been found to be natural – from an aneurysm –but there were apparently factors that contributed to it.” It is also not known yet whether all the injuries found on her body were sustained on the night of her death.
The lack of enough evidence to form sound conclusions of what happened on that tragic night did not stop various “influencers” and “social justice warriors” from going on witch hunts on social media. Netizens (like this one) encouraged everyone to spread information that presumably would help speed up justice due Dacera. Often the information used by these digital lynch mobs were nothing more than names of people identified based on second-hand information and photos taken from public social media accounts. Many were taken from Dacera’s Instagram profile where one could have easily checked their timestamps to ensure these were not misrepresented when shared.
Ironic that these Netizens liberally drop the term “justice” in their half-brained tweets but fail to consider that presumption of innocence is a key pillar in modern criminal justice systems. Popular social media “influencer” Frank Baraan was one of the Netizens initially calling for blood and rousing the Mob and only backpedaled from his earlier misguided tweets after being called out by other Twitter users.
It is evident from the tweets exhibited above what the relevant principles that underlie the calls for “justice” are. However, much as these rabid “activists” would like everyone to see the tragic story of Christine Dacera from only their preferred side, the fact is, there will always be more than one side to a story. This is the reason why police investigations take time and properly-conducted court trials take even longer. The sides of all parties need to be considered and theories systematically developed on the back of evidence and ruled out when said evidence does not stack up.
Social media lynch mobs degrade that effort by making the chatter emotional rather than based on reason. Christine Dacera would be the victim of whatever crime that may have transpired on that fateful night. However, there are also other people who were involved. Some of them may be found guilty of a crime. Others may have simply been at the wrong place at the wrong time and dragged into this gawd-awful mess by mere force of circumstance. All are presumed innocent until proven guilty.",Others
A confluence of Islamic extremists’ and Mindanao drug lords’ interests led to the Marawi City siege,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/05/a-confluence-of-islamic-extremists-and-mindanao-drug-lords-interests-led-to-the-marawi-city-siege/,"My Professor in Communication Arts Marian Pastor Roces is at it again. Mass media and society was the course I took under her back then. As one who is deeply involved in showcasing Muslim-Filipino culture to the world, Roces takes it upon herself to carry the cudgels for the bakwit of Marawi. She writes in her Now You Know piece “Invisible Marawi”…
Of the 300,000 refugees who took off from Ground Zero, those who do not live in refugee camps are staying with relatives all over the Philippines. Whatever visibility they had immediately postwar—in the refugee camps where rich and poor, friends and enemies, allies and the rido-inflamed had to pack themselves together—evaporated when most of them disappeared into extended clan assistance networks.
As a leading stalwart of the Opposition being a member of partisan group Kaya Natin, she considers herself instrumental in convincing Leni Robredo to run for Vice-President in 2016. She shares this distinction with singer Jim Paredes. It’s no wonder then that she blames the President for the delay in the rebuilding of Marawi.
President Duterte’s initial idea for Marawi was to keep the people out, hand over the property to Chinese developers or their proxies to create some fantasy Dubai or Singapore, and let a selection of the residents back to enjoy a theme park way of life.
This kitschy dream of progress and resurrection should be reminder enough that kitsch is the aesthetic Chinese fascism. (Think dolomite beach, Manila Bay.)
Those of you who haven’t spent an extended period of time among Muslim-Filipinos will not have an idea of their social mores. They have not adopted modern systems first introduced during the American colonial period. As Roces mentioned, land titles don’t exist. All of the properties in the cities have been handed down from one generation to another. Rido is a blood feud between families. It usually ends with one family being rendered extinct after all of its members are dead. This is why our Muslim-Filipino brothers value their firearms more than their wives.
Most of you read the news stories about the cash discovered inside abandoned homes. There were also the stories which came out after soldiers raided the Ampatuan compound. Muslim-Filipinos don’t believe in banks. This is why former President Ferdinand Marcos established the Philippine Amanah Bank. Every aspect of their society is governed by the Shari’a system. The true story is shabu or methamphetamine chloride begins in Zamboanga City.
Duterte was correct in stating that it wasn’t mainland Chinese who pioneered this trade in the country. It was the Taiwanese bamboo gangs. The basic principle of Chinese business is to keep capital earning a profit and the profit to be ploughed back in as capital to earn a profit. The Taiwanese came to Zamboanga to buy marine products which is abundant in the Sulu Sea all the way to the Malacca Strait. Later on, they put up clandestine shabu laboratories. It didn’t take too long for shabu to become popular as the poor man’s cocaine.
Islam prohibits vices but there are Muslims who don’t conform to the practice. The grant of autonomy during Fidel Ramos’s Presidency led to Muslim-Filipinos getting into the drug trade. The prominent families of Central Mindanao who were also politicians were the pioneers; Candao, Ampatuan and Mangudadatu. This was how the Muslim quarter in Quiapo became a distribution center. The Taiwanese used their marine products business to launder the drug monies and ship shabu to Manila in the bellies of fish to be sold in Navotas and Malabon. This was how the CAMANAVA (Kaloocan,Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela) area became another distribution point for shabu. Remember the deebeedes (DVDs) trade which led to the mass migration of Maranaos from Central Mindanao to other parts of the country? That was the money laundering operation of the Ampatuans.
The Maguindanao massacre wasn’t only about politics. It was also about drugs. The Michael Yang being identified with Duterte is not the Michael Yang who is really involved in the drug trade. Shie Jie Marine Products built a cathedral-like processing plant in the Tetuan district. I had the opportunity to visit the plant when I was still in the trading business. It didn’t smell like the traditional marine products processing plant. It smelled of chemicals which confirmed my suspicion that it was a shabu laboratory. Shie Jie is now operating as Millenium Ocean Star Corporation with “processing plants” all over the Philippines in some areas where there is no volume of marine products landings. It’s safe to say that it is not solely producing marine products alone.
The Marawi siege wasn’t exactly the handiwork of Islamic extremists. It was the latter working together with the Muslim drug lords who were feeling the heat of the intensified anti-drug operations conducted by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Mindanao became the center of shabu production after 1986 when it was claimed by Tingting Cojuangco, who was also fascinated by Muslim-Filipino culture. Margarita Manzano De Los Reyes Cojuangco probably envisioned herself as a Queen more than Imeldific ever dreamed of becoming. Her uncle, Ramon, had vast rubber plantations in Basilan and Zamboanga del Sur. Her factotum at that time was her cousin, la reyna del maricas, Raul. She built a white house resembling a palace in Cotabato. But as the pioneering business cum society columnist Vic Agustin would say, this is another story.
I’m sure Ms. Roces also knows of the history of shabu in Mindanao. This is only one of many because of the prominence of the personalities involved. But make no mistake about it. If Duterte hadn’t run in 2016, the country would surely be at the same level as Mexico and Colombia. Now you know why the Yellowidiots made the drug war to be all about human rights and extra-judicial killings.",Others
This is why woke “influencers” aren’t credible socio-political commentators,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/this-is-why-woke-influencers-arent-credible-political-commentators/,"After that big shrill spate of ululations coming from a lynch mob of screeching “influencers” that catapulted the hashtag #JusticeForChristineDacera onto their hallowed Church of Trending Hashtags, it seems certain “thought leaders” are now in the midst of some painful personal reflection. One of the ringleaders, social media “icon” Frank Baraan was one among many of them called out for breaking a cornerstone principle of any modern criminal justice system and has since issued another one of his now-famous It’s All About Me apologies…
Adding further to what would go on to become a lengthy thread elucidating the glory of his chi chi “apology”, Baraan then tweets…
Just like everyone else, I, too, want #JusticeForChristineDacera. But I should have paused to verify the facts.
I’ve been advocating for human rights, but in a momentary huge lapse of judgment, I forgot one very important human right:
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE of SUSPECTS.
And to think Baraan is one of those Red Tagging Crybabies who also populate the shrill echo chambers of Philippine social media wokedom. Indeed, in “unwittingly” tweeting in a manner that presumed the guilt of a number of people who may just had been unfortunate enough to be at the wrong party at the wrong time, Baraan and many of his like-minded ilk proved what big halfwits they really are. A “momentary huge lapse of judgment” had already been embedded in the tiny brains of tens of thousands of Baraan’s moron followers.
No amount of “apology” will undo the damage that had already been done and the further injustice that these ironic “social justice warriors” created. Mela Franco Habijan, a “transgender woman with a beautifulpurpose [sic]”, is another such “influencer” whose good intentions were as built on as astounding an edifice of self-absorption as Baraan’s. Her almost 13,000 followers were just as misled by her tweets and ought to be learning to be a bit more circumspect about being accessories to the spread of crooked information.
Bottom line is this. These woke bozos are first to get all snooty about the “spread of disinformation” that blights the social media landscape. So then much should be expected of these pompous windbags. In an age when information is created and spread following a few key strokes and a tap on the Retweet or Share button within minutes or even seconds of inception or consumption of said information, it is essential that communicators get it right the first time.
The big reflection in order here is the crooked emotionalism that these people contribute to chatter on politics and social issues. Reason, logic, and cool heads are sorely lacking in these landscapes and the few who contribute such are drowned out by the noise sustained by shills like Baraan and his tribe.",Others
2022 elections a chance for Filipinos to remove communist vermin from public office,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/2022-elections-a-chance-for-filipinos-to-remove-communist-vermin-from-public-office/,"Joel Pablo Salud is one of my “favorite” editors in-chief, the other being his mentor Inday Espina Varona. He is very proud of his lack of formal education, yet constantly on the prowl for validation with social media postings of his vast book collection. He asks in his latest PhilSTAR piece: What would you ask the Presidential candidates if given the chance?
Salud’s fantasized questions are as predictable as he is self-deluded.
Will those who enabled the Duterte regime to carry out this inhumanity be charged? What about paid trolls? Will they be held accountable for the widespread intimidation and harassment of those critical of this regime? Should a law be passed deeming troll farms illegal?
What about the bereaved families of EJK victims? Will compensation be granted? What of the thousands imprisoned without due process?
Never mind that there are surveys confirming the trust and approval ratings of the President. In his and his cohort’s minds, we are under the spell of Dutertismo, an environment of magical realism where we think all is well but is actually not. Duterte must’ve undergone tutelage from the barangs of Siquijor early on in his career as a public official which is why he’s never lost an election since he was appointed Vice-Mayor of Davao City in 1986.
Salud mentions a number of issues, all against Duterte, not necessarily for the candidates except for the Anti-Terrorism Law, of which Sen. Ping Lacson was the principal author of. But what is their beef with the Anti-Terror Law? It’s simply the power of the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) to arrest without a warrant and detain for 14 days, a suspect upon the approval of the members of the ATC. Mind you, all of the kindred spirits of the leftist-liberal-militants are spared from this proviso. It is nowhere even near as draconian as the British-authored Internal Security At, in force in Malaysia and Singapore.
This is the problem with leftist-liberal militants who demand much from the State but want as little intervention as possible. What is contradictory is their stand on the West Philippine Sea. They’re anti-China but their brethren in the Communist Party of the Philippines, its terrorist arm the New People’s Army, and its “legal” National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) have been for the Maoist version of communism since 1968. This was a radical shift from the Marxist-Leninist orientation of the original Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, under Luis Taruc and the Lava brothers.
Hypocrisy is another outstanding character trait of Salud and his ilk. They are against the drug war and accuse the State of masterminding extra-judicial killings (EJKs) but refuse to hold the NPA to account for the murder of civililans, soldiers, and policemen in the insurgency. They claim the country’s sovereignty has been subverted by China but gladly open the doors of the country for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate the officials cited in the case filed by the late Jude Sabio, former Sen. Antonio Trillanes and former Rep. Gary Alejano.
There is also the ongoing ideological clash between the Pinklawans and the Reds over the inclusion of progressives in the Pinko Senatorial slate and the fact that their hated trapos are guest candidates. They claim they participate in the mainstream to make the people aware of their plight and are fighting for the people and have their support but they haven’t won a direct election since they started participating in the same.
The most glaring contradiction is martial law human rights violations. Their revolution is morally justified in their opinion, which is why the State has no right to defend itself and the citizens from the insurgency which they have been conducting against the State and its citizens. This is why there is the Bantayog ng mga Bayani which serves as their memorial for the “victims” of martial law.
The 2022 election is the chance of the people to vote these morons out of office. They have continually exploited the poor for their cause but haven’t done anything to lift them out of poverty. They are the malaise in our society as they corrupt the youth believing that “activism” against the government is justified leading them to leave their families to join the NPA in the hinterlands, only to die in encounters with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) later on.
It’s about time the likes of Salud and his cohorts be called to account for the consequences of their actions. We have been looking like fools before the international community for having the longest-running insurgency with no end in sight. The onus is not entirely on government as these morons are backed by socialist and communist non-government organisations (NGOs) in Europe which fund them. When will the poor realize that they’re being taken for a ride when the leader of the revolution, Jose Maria Sison, lives comfortably in Utrecht as a political refugee?",Others
Agreement banning Philippine military from UP campus finally TERMINATED!,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/agreement-banning-philippine-military-from-up-campus-finally-terminated/,"Finally the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will be able to do its job rooting out the scourge of communist terrorism at one of its key sources of recruitment — the University of the Philippines (UP). This development was shared in a tweet issued by the campus newspaper of the UP, the Philippine Collegian announcing (or, presumably, denouncing) the termination of an agreement made in 1989 that bars AFP personnel from entering any UP campus.
The tweet also included screenshots of what seems to be a letter signed by Secretary of Defense Delfin Lorenzana addressed to UP president Danilo Concepcion.
As expected, the Collegian editorial leadership and, very likely, their comrades across the broader network of communist front groups are “up in arms” drumming up this latest outrage fad and rallying the revolutionary troops to “take to the streets”. A subsequent tweet from the Collegian calls for a protest rally to be mounted at Quezon Hall in the UP Diliman campus. It exhibits the all-too-familiar battle cry claiming all this is part of a conspiracy to suppress “academic freedom”.
The infiltration of the UP student body by elements of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and, more disturbingly, its campus newspaper has been a long-known problem that has marred campus life and endangered generations of UP students for several decades. In his Manila Times piece “How communists gained control of UP Student Council, Philippine Collegian, and most campus organizations”, former ambassador and former CPP comrade Bobi Tiglao shares how, back in 1973, “the CPP settled down to secretly penetrate innocent-looking organizations, undertake subtle anti-dictatorship activities through these groups, recruit members and develop a mass base.”
By 1975, the CPP had already laid out a decent network at UP made up of more than 80 cadres and members, and about thrice this number were “national-democratic” (ND) activists. The party branch was bombastically called “University Revolutionary Council,” or URC. Its executive committee was called Komiteng Tagapagpaganap or verbally, KT. The URC fell under the administrative supervision of the CPP’s District 2, or “D2” which covered Quezon City and Marikina.
Tiglao also specifically cites the Philippine Collegian and what went on to become the University Student Council (UP-USC) as key groups infiltrated by the CPP…
The URC’s organizational department (OD) was tasked with overall organizational maintenance and political guidance of the numerous party groups and national-democratic core groups. These were embedded in the various student organizations, in the newly elected Student Conference and in the Philippine Collegian.
Indeed, it is about time the ridiculous notion of an agreement to ban Philippine military personnel from entering UP campuses be terminated. It is clear that the CPP and its front groups as well as campus student organisations such as the Collegian which its members had infiltrated pose a threat to the broader student body of the Philippines’ premiere institute of higher learning. It is only when the national police with the support of the military are accorded reasonable access to UP campuses to work within the frame of the law to root out communist terrorist activities will parents feel more confident in the safety of their children most of whom only want to pursue their studies in peace in an environment conducive to learning.",Others
"#Halalan2022, Leni Robredo’s so-called “crowdfunding”, and the COMELEC commissioners Duterte will appoint in Feb 2022",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/halalan2022-leni-robredos-so-called-crowdfunding-and-the-comelec-commissioners-duterte-will-appoint-in-feb-2022/,"The camp of Vice-President Leni Robredo was warned by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) about its crowdfunding drive for her upcoming campaign. Robredo made her announcement to run for president in the 2022 national elections last October 8. Diehard Robredo supporters have formed Team Leni Robredo as the campaign volunteer organization which runs parallel with her official campaign team headed by campaign manager former Sen. Bam Aquino. Team Leni Robredo made a public call for volunteer donations starting at P50.00 up to any amount which an individual can afford.
COMELEC Commissioner Rowena Guanzon drew attention to the crowdfunding initiative because the Omnibus Election Code prohibits candidates from accepting campaign donations from foreign individuals and organizations. This includes Filipinos residing abroad who hold dual citizenship, under which definition they do not qualify because their principal residence is outside of the Philippines. COMELEC Campaign Finance Office (CFO) officer-in-charge Efraim Bag-id also flagged potential flaws in the crowdfunding drive, particularly with regard to identifying the donors. The candidates’ campaigns are required to submit a Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE) within the specified period after the conduct of the election. Recall that, in 2016, the Liberal Party was late in submitting its SOCE but was given an extension by then COMELEC Chair Andres Bautista. This was unprecedented. The late submmission or non-submission of the SOCE carries with it the penalty of the disqualifcation of the candidate of the party from holding office and a perpetual ban on public office after.
Congressman Pantaleon Alvarez filed a case questioning the validity of the extension granted by Bautista to the Liberal Party. Nothing eventually came out of it and the winning candidates of the Liberals went on to assume the posts they won in the 2016 election, including Robredo. Bautista went on to resign in the wake of the scandal he found himself in after his wife, Patricia, revealed dozens of bank accounts which allegedly was the fruit of payoffs Bautista received when he was the Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which is tasked with the recovery of the Marcos wealth, as well as those he allegedly received as COMELEC Chair from its automation service provider, Smartmatic. Nothing has come out of the investigation into Bautista’s case and he is in exile in the US even if the two countries have an existing extradition treaty.
Robredo’s Spokesperson, Barry Gutierrez, clarified that the Office of the Vice-President (OVP) was aware of the initiative taken by the volunteers but that the funds raised would not go directly to the OVP. Where would it go then if not for use by the campaign? In the 2016 election, Robredo ran for Vice-President with the full backing of the administration of then President Noynoy Aquino. While the election code also prohibits the use of government resources in the campaign, the COMELEC seldom imposes the prohibitions expressly stipulated under the law. The same is true for the Opposition political parties.
The COMELEC is composed of one chair and six commissioners. They are Sheriff Abbas, Rowena Guanzon, Socorro Inting, Marlon Casquejo, Antonio Kho and Aimee Ferolino. Come February 2022, Abbas, Guanzon and Kho will be retiring and the President will be able to appoint replacements to the vacancies which results in all commissioners being appointed by President Duterte. The Opposition could use this against the administration if they don’t do well in the May 2022 polls. Coincidentally, the campaign period officially begins in February also.
In the meantime, the issue of the crowdfunding drive of Team Leni Robredo remains hanging with the eventual resolution most likely being that the monies be privately consolidated and donations turned over by a qualifiied individual or entity to the OVP.",Others
Highlighting that Christine Dacera was in an all-male party is NOT “victim blaming”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/highlighting-that-christine-dacera-was-in-an-all-male-party-is-not-victim-blaming/,"In overthinking the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Philippine Airlines flight attendant Christine Dacera, Inquirer columnist Hyacinth Tagupa in her piece “It’s a tragedy, but…” inadvertently backward-reasons her “analysis” from prescribed woke dogma and, as a result, arrives at a flawed thesis on the matter. Tagupa’s brainwave is encapsulated in this single paragraph of hers…
Here are facts: Drinking with the opposite sex is not asking to be harmed. A person in a vulnerable state does not give others the right to take advantage. It does not make crime “understandable.”
The flaw in Tagupa’s reasoning lies in how she takes each observed detail of the case and then constructs an argument around it outside of and isolated from the complete context of the broad circumstances surrounding the case. In so doing, she oversimplifies her assertion thus…
(1) Men allegedly assaulted victim — men bad
(2) Victim had a “right” not to be assaulted — woman victim
Conclusion: Christine Dacera absolved of all personal accountability.
Nobody is saying the behaviour of the alleged perpetrators is “understandable” nor is anyone saying that Dacera is to be blamed for that behaviour. However, the fact is that such behaviour is likely under the full circumstances of the case and, therefore, the situation presented a recognisable risk to Dacera. Dacera was indeed in “a vulnerable state” as Tagupa herself points out. But just as a car left unlocked in the middle of Manila is also in a similarly vulnerable state and does not give anyone the right to steal it does not change the probability of it being stolen.
A tightrope and a tightrope walker taken individually by themselves are not risks. But, together, plus height, they form a risky situation. In the case of Dacera’s misfortune, the elements present were individually benign — a young woman in a slinky party outfit, a group of young men out for a good time, a room in a so-so hotel. Put all three together plus alcohol and possibly drugs and you get a situation that elicits the same feelings one would get watching a daring tightrope act at the circus.
Fans of the Star Wars franchise would be familiar with the quip “I’ve got a bad feeling about this.” At the back of most normal people’s heads, many of whom are fearful of being cancelledt by wokedom’s Thought Police for simply thinking normal, is that bad feeling you get when you see a young woman going off to an unsafe place alone with a group of young men. It just does not feel right, and most parents with young daughters know that gut feeling. Who in their right mind would not think “I have a bad feeling about this”?
The only right being violated here is people’s prerogative to judge a situation as they see fit.
Our lives. Our sons and daughters.
Nobody has the right to “cancel” anyone’s intuition. What separates the adults from the kiddie “influencers” who sound off shrill tweets before all the facts are taken stock of is an ability to put that intuition in proper perspective.

Kiko Pangilinan’s call: “Don’t mess with UP” — communists are EXEMPTED from this of course,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/01/kiko-pangilinans-call-dont-mess-with-up-communists-are-exempted-from-this-of-course/,"Do the communists speak for the majority of members of the University of the Philippines (UP) student body? Do they represent the voice of the average Filipino student who only wants to pursue her studies in peace and in safety? This is the question Filipinos need to ask seeing that rhetoric that aims to create the next outrage fad surrounding the recent termination of an agreement between the UP and the Department of National Defense (DND) banning military personnel access to UP campuses is being amplified and spread by the country’s biggest corporate media channels.
It is important to note that only one side of this story — that of “activist” groups under the ideological guidance of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) — is being given priority space by mainstream media. As soon as the word was out, no less than the ABS-CBN News Channel gave top airtime to the statement of “vice president” Leni Robredo on the matter. According to Robredo, the termination of the agreement was “designed to sow fear”, “discourage dissent”, and “silence criticism”. Very original, right? As such, we give a hats off to Senator Sharon Cuneta himself, a.k.a. Kiko Pangilinan, who is a bit more creative in his rhetoric issuing a threat on Twitter to all not to “mess with UP”.
All these ululations raise only one important question:
Or else what exactly?
While Senator Cuneta stops short of going into specifics, Robredo, in her statement, calls on Filipinos to “do what needs to be done” and suggests that, “at long last”, an opportunity has arisen to “stand our grounds and speak out”. This is evidently problematic as Robredo being “vice president” and, therefore, a top officer of the Executive Branch of the Philippine Government and a potential Commander in Chief of the armed forces is seemingly inciting Filipinos to defy their own military. Perhaps it is not unreasonable to press the “vice president” further on what exactly she means by “what needs to be done”.
What exactly needs to be done, madame Leni Robredo?
Indeed, if Robredo is to be seen to be the “leader” of the “Opposition”, then she should make herself crystal clear as to what she proposes happens next. Will it be another “people power” march? Considering that the people most impacted by this development are the communists, will she categorically declare an alliance with these terrorists?
Enlighten us plez Madam “vice president”.
Filipinos — specially students of the UP and their parents — need to give Mr. Sharon Cuneta, the “vice president”, and these communist “activists” a reality check. How many stakeholders in the UP echo the dishonest sentiment of the communists and their lackeys in Big Corporate Media? The real outrage here is in how Filipino communists and their network of front “activist” groups presume to speak for the average Filipino university student. The even bigger crime is in the crooked way mainstream media outlets amplify these dishonest messages with seeming intent to keep those who beg to differ to these messages silent or, at least, drown out their sparse voices. It’s time Filipinos put their foot down and give traditional “activists” and traditional media a reality check. More importantly, they should vote wisely in the coming national elections to ensure that this check on the dangerous incitements being issued by crooked politicians and obsolete “activists” is made absolutely real.",Others
Philippines hopelessly divided under a government that stood for “UNITY”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/philippines-hopelessly-divided-under-a-government-that-stood-for-unity/,"In his recent Inquirer column, Randy David shares his views on the aftermath of the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. He cites the inutile state of the Philippines’ judicial system which “failed to hold Duterte accountable for the thousands of killings during his brutal drug war.”
[Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla’s] acknowledgement of the ICC as a “court of last resort” for the families of victims of the drug war is a quiet but radical shift. He recognized that our institutions indeed failed, and clearly had no intention, to deliver justice on their own.
While the focus of David’s lament is on the alleged “extra-judicial killings” (EJKs) supposedly perpetrated during Duterte’s drug war, what of the victims of the drug addicts and pushers who also don’t have the resources for extended court proceedings? And that is for cases where the perpetrators are caught by the police, which is another challenge in itself.
A Filipino who faces this conundrum has to prioritize earning a living for his family and not having to pay a lawyer or rely on the unreliable and usually under-experienced and overworked Public Attorney’s Office (PAO lawyer. The victim or the victim’s family, usually doesn’t have the means to take time off from work to attend to the case. The difficulty of the experience often leads to the plaintiffs just giving up and the accused never being prosecuted unless it’s a state case.
There is also the issue of how we obtain evidence and prosecute presidents who run afoul of the law. In the case of former President Joseph “Erap” Estrada, the demolition job on him began when he emerged as the top candidate in 1998 and never stopped until he was ousted in 2001.
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was packaged as the savior by the Yellowidiots until she disagreed with how the Hacienda Luisita case was to be handled. There was also the issue of how she was just supposed to serve the unexpired term of Estrada and not run for re-election. But she decided not to honor the agreement and she faced numerous attempts to oust her during her extended administration. She wasn’t successful in getting her nominated successor appointed and she spent the next five years of the administration of her successor, the late former President Noynoy Aquino, in detention.
Do you see the pattern? Philippine presidents need to get an anointed successor elected to ensure they suffer no revenge-prosecution after the protection of immunity lapses. In Duterte’s case, the Yellowidiots already ran to the International Criminal Court (ICC) even before his term was over. Some Filipinos turn a blind eye to the legitimate issue of sovereignty just because it doesn’t align with their goal of seeing a hated president in detention.
The stability of the government also comes into play. Erap was convicted by the Sandiganbayan but had to be pardoned by GMA to ensure she finished her term.
The incontrovertible truth about the fate of Duterte is he was renditioned to the ICC because he posed a threat to the administration. It remains to be seen what his fate will be under a foreign court whose credibility isn’t beyond question. What’s certain is it has again divided the country in the midst of the midterm election cycle which still has to contend with the impeachment trial of the vice-president who happens to be Duterte’s daughter.
Perhaps this is why why the influential Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) has taken a public stand last Friday. The INC has always maintained neutrality in politics during the most tumultuous periods in the country’s history. It did order its members out in the streets when it perceived that the Aquino administration was going after it during an internal leadership issue. But it didn’t make any formal statement about the administration’s actions.
We face a myriad of problems which we can solve if only our leaders aren’t so busy protecting the status quo which benefits those who rule the country in politics and business. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what’s wrong with the system. It’s evident. It’s staring at us in our collective faces.
The only hope we have left is in ourselves if we turn to collective action. Otherwise, if we don’t take action then we should accept the consequence of inaction which is counting to see our country go down the path to nowhere.",Others
The Dutertard “influencers” need to EVOLVE,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2025/03/the-dutertard-influencers-need-to-evolve/,"The circle of “influencers’ surrounding former President Rodrigo Duterte and his clan, which includes current Vice President Sara Duterte, need to shape up. The cult of personality approach where everything is an appeal to emotion — personal loyalty, patriotism, regionalism, and the all-time greatest hit, utang na loob (debt of gratitude) have all become passé. Yet these comms relics continue to be flogged by the “Duterte Die-hard Supporters” (DDS) mob.
Strip all the shrill emotionalism from the “issue” of the former president’s “plight” in The Hague under the thumb of the “International Criminal Court” (ICC) and we are left with a few sensible things to work with top of which is the questionable nature of the ICC itself and its manufactured jurisdiction as a “court” to reckon with and, as such, the sketchy circumstances surrounding how a Filipino citizen — a former chief executive, no less — was simply packed up and handed over to a foreign colonial power.
But then even discounting the formidable critical mass of “international law” and the Global North powers that enforce it, Duterte is a difficult man to defend. Foremost is his own predisposition to self-incrimination. He is first to not just admit but boast about his homicidal approach to law enforcement encompassing his gigs as Davao City mayor and President of the Philippines. Philippine Presidents, after all, are all the same in the extrajudicial manner with which they kill anyone they perceive to be a threat to their feudal clan. The sensible ones, however, do so covertly. Duterte wasn’t — and isn’t — as subtle nor as discreet. Neither is he as sensible.
Those are the key facts surrounding this latest circus. The “content creators” buzzing around this clown show should then work with these factual input and stop their incessant rosary rallies of delivering tired DDS slogans ad nauseum. Work on building sound arguments and educated scenarios and enough of the batang yagit, Joan Of Arc, and Rudy Fernandez narratives!
Perhaps a tad too vulcan for the OA Fipino mind? Fair enough. Maybe a bit of emotional icing can be slathered over the propaganda cake. Consider then that the Philippines now has the distinction of being the only Asian country that voluntarily handed over a former head of state to a former colonial power. Nakakahiya, right? The perfect touch for a society motivated by hiya and not much else.
The perfect time for strategic innovation is now given that the “thought leaders” of the true enemy here — the Yellowtard-Communist Axis — are showing no signs of strategic competence in story telling either. Are the Dutertards up to the job? As always, abangan ang susunod na kabanata.",Others
Communists like Sara Elago object to being “red tagged” but continue to incite support for their failed “revolution”,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/06/communists-like-sara-elago-object-to-being-red-tagged-but-continue-to-incite-support-for-their-failed-revolution/,"Of the Philippines’ communist “movement”, national artist F. Sionil Jose poses this question in his PhilSTAR piece “Our people’s army” today: “Why then does Joma Sison and his aging cabal persist?” I believe the question should be rephrased: Why does the communist movement still have hypocritical leaders?
I’m not referring to the communist old guard who are effectively write-offs — old dogs that can’t be taught new tricks. I refer more to the young such as the party-list representatives in Congress and what stands as the leadership of leftist-militant groups in the mainstream; Teddy Casiño, Neri Colmenares, Sarah Elago, Tinay Palabay, Tonyo Cruz and the like. There are also their media allies such as the group of Inday Espina Varona and the liberal journalists who don’t label themselves as leftists but are friendly to them and don’t hide their bias against the present administration.
The hypocrisy is glaring. When any of their members are arrested or killed, it’s a human rights violation. When soldiers and policemen are killed, they’re casualties of the “revolution.” Then there are the youth who are recruited and separated from their families when they go underground. They wind up dead later in encounters with government forces. I cannot see the justification or the the moral ground where these leaders stand when it comes to the sacrifice of human life which should be sacrosanct if their rights are the priority.
In his piece, Sionil proposes a way forward;
As I already said, the young people today who are lured by idealism to join the New People’s Army should recognize that they cannot overthrow the state or sunder this nation anymore. What they can do is to join politics or organize themselves into nationalist cadres.
As for the 4,000 members of the New People’s Army, I hope the government will grant them amnesty and induct them into the Armed Forces where they can then illustrate the fullest depth of their idealism. We need a strong Army, and thank God ours has developed democratically.
The national artist for literature has made his stand known in a previous column; it’s time to put an end to the insurgency. You can’t have communists fighting a revolution and yet object to being tagged as such even if they’re obviously members of the movement. Isn’t this indicative of a lack of commitment to the cause? Public sympathy is obviously not on their side as a few of them have run for national office but lost miserably. If it doesn’t enjoy poplar support the cause is a lost one. The obvious reason why is that they enjoy the perks and privileges of being a power bloc in society. Witness how they provide the crowds during protests and rallies and votes during election day.
The truth is the communists are nothing but a bunch of intellectual, ideological and social prostitutes and pimps of the highest order. They will never admit that their revolution is a failure but they continue to be a thorn on the side of government. It’s about time that we do away with this pestilence and their protectors who benefit from them at the expense of the Filipino people.",Others
"Leni Robredo: No need to DQ BBM, “we won without a disqualification” in 2016. But did she REALLY?",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/leni-robredo-no-need-to-dq-bbm-we-won-without-a-disqualification-in-2016-but-did-she-really/,"If I were Leni Robredo, I wouldn’t be reminding people of what happened back in 2016 when allegations of electoral fraud marred what was supposed to be an “important” national election. In arrogantly proclaiming that she handily beat rival candidate Bongbong Marcos for the vice presidency back then, old wounds have been opened including those to do with the persistent mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Andy Bautista who was Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman at the time.
“Ako, it doesn’t make sense.  Kung gusto namin siya ipa-disqualify dapat sana no’ng laban pa namin ng VP,” Robredo told reporters in a press conference in Negros Occidental on Friday.
“Saka kung ang purpose ng disqualification para maalis siya sa contest na ito, hindi naman kailangan.  Naglaban na kami no’ng 2016, nanalo naman kami na walang ganyan,” she added.
Perhaps it might not have occurred to Robredo that her camp, the Liberal Party (LP), at the time were not as clued in on just how formidable an opponent they were up against — which is why a desperate stunt like disqualifying an opponent (such as what is being attempted today) was not in the cards early in the campaign. Indeed, many observers looked back at how desperation on the part of the Yellowtards kicked in late into the campaign as then candidate Rodrigo Duterte pulled far ahead of LP bet Mar Roxas at the eleventh hour.
With just hours to go and the presidency all but lost to Duterte, Robredo became the Hail Mary Pass that needed to deliver a score for the Yellowtards. Many observers are convinced that the designated wide receiver in those final hours of the election was the then COMELEC chair who, it seems, went on to deliver on his assignment paving the way for Robredo’s self-proclaimed “win”. As the story goes, that successful delivery came at a cost and so now, the mystery persists: Where is Andy Bautista?
Did Robredo know what may have been going on behind the scenes back then? That too is a mystery. Just hours after the shocking statistical improbabilities that accompanied the VP count (a seeming “neck-and-neck race”) were picked up by keen watchers, Robredo joined the rest of her LP ilk in parroting what came across as a prepared script wrought in the midst of what looked like an orchestrated ruling out of any possibility of fraud. Never mind that authorities — presumably led by the COMELEC — are duty-bound to investigate all allegations. Never mind that there was no basis on such short notice to rule out the possibility of fraud. Never mind that Smartmatic personnel implicated in the allegations were mysteriously allowed to leave the Philippines.
Did Leni Robredo actually win the vice presidency in 2016? Is she the Philippines’ rightful VP today? All that remains debatable because the COMELEC had left many questions unresolved, had tainted evidence pertinent to the case, and may have been complicit in allowing Bautista who had, by then, become a person of interest in the case to leave the country. In short, the case remains open today as far as millions of Filipinos are concerned. Robredo may have been proclaimed VP by a Filipino judge, but so have many other top officials under similarly dubious circumstances in the past following unlawful spectacles commonly associated with the Yellowtard “people power” narrative: Cory Aquino proclaimed “president” after the 1986 EDSA coup d’etat, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo after the “EDSA II” lynching of Joseph “Erap” Estrada.
Anything can be made “legal” in the Philippines if a big enough mob of cherry-picked participants gives the thumbs-up and a Philippine judge can be suckered into being an accessory to the fraud that follows.

Leni Robredo should be DISQUALIFIED for encouraging her followers to accept bribes,https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/10/leni-robredo-should-be-disqualified-for-encouraging-her-followers-to-accept-bribes/,"“Vice president” and presidential candidate Leni Robredo in an online forum with kasambahays (household servants) made a statement encouraging her supporters to be a party to vote buying. The Manila Bulletin reports how Robredo told her audience in that forum to “[accept] money from politicians during the campaign season”…
“Parati kong sinasabi tanggapin nyo kasi galing din naman ‘yan sa atin. Yung pinambibili ng boto, pera din ‘yan ng taumbayan. Tatanggapin mo pero ang iboboto mo kung sino ‘yung nasa konsensya mo (I always say to accept it because that comes from us. The money they use to buy your vote, that’s people’s money, too. Accept it, but vote who is in your conscience),” she said during a virtual meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 26, with members of Kasambahay for Leni.
First of all, how is Robredo sure that, as she claims, the money used to buy votes is “people’s money”? Campaign funds are mostly sourced from private donors. Robredo seems to suggest that all campaign funds were illegally obtained. That is evidently not true and she is misleading her supporters by suggesting that accepting these bribes is the right thing to do. Worse, Robredo is telling them that this is money that is theirs to take. That is so messed up!
Second and the more important point, in issuing the above statement, Robredo violates the law as per Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code where it is stated in paragraph (b), “Conspiracy to bribe voters. Two or more persons, whether candidates or not, who come to an agreement concerning the commission of any violation of paragraph (a) of this section and decide to commit it.” Paragraph (a) which the above refers to states…
a. Vote-buying and vote-selling.
1. Any person who gives, offers or promises money or anything of value, gives or promises any office or employment, franchise or grant, public or private, or makes or offers to make an expenditure, directly or indirectly, or cause an expenditure to be made to any person, association, corporation, entity, or community in order to induce anyone or the public in general to vote for or against any candidate or withhold his vote in the election, or to vote for or against any aspirant for the nomination or choice of a candidate in a convention or similar selection process of a political party.
2. Any person, association, corporation, group or community who solicits or receives, directly or indirectly, any expenditure or promise of any office or employment, public or private, for any of the foregoing considerations.
By giving her blessing to these kasambahays to receive bribe money and by assuring them that this is right conduct during an election, Robredo has, effectively come to an agreement concerning the commission of any violation of paragraph (a) (quoted above) with her supporters.
Receiving bribes is, by itself, a crime. Robredo should know better than to condone — in this instance, encourage — criminal activity. This is astoundingly irresponsible behaviour coming from no less than a Philippine “vice president” as she is pushing her followers to enter into an illegal transaction with criminals.
To be fair, it is clear that Leni Robredo is just plain dumb. A true bonafide crook would not go and make stupid public statement about one’s own crooked intentions. However, committing a crime because of plain stupidity is still a crime — just like a stupid driver driving in a stupid way that puts lives at risk is a criminal. Leni Robredo should be made accountable for her actions. Now na.",Others
"With Archbishop Soc Villegas’s backing, Yellowtards continue to use PERVERTED logic to justify vote selling",https://www.getrealphilippines.com/2021/11/with-archbishop-soc-villegass-backing-yellowtards-continue-to-use-perverted-logic-to-justify-vote-selling/,"Days after news of Leni Robredo’s statement encouraging her kasambahay audience in a household servants’ forum to take bribe money from politicians exploded in her face, Opposition partisans continue to defend their “leader”. James Jimenez, spokesperson of the Philippines’ Commission on Elections (COMELEC) had already issued a statement on the matter confirming that vote buying is an election offense and that voters should not be offered a suggestion otherwise. Nonetheless, the desperation of the situation surrounding Robredo’s bid for the presidency is such that her supporters will go to great lengths to bend, stretch, and twist logic and reason in order to make their preferred candidate come out on the right side of their perverted sense of “morality”.
The most high-profile defense of Robredo came from Roman Catholic Archbishop Socrates Villegas who, in a video posted on Facebook, assured the Filipino faithful that they should accept bribe money from politicians “if they are hungry or in need” so long as they do not fulfil the condition of the bribe. In short, Villegas is telling Filipinos that poverty is an excuse to commit crime. As an archbishop, Villegas essentially gives the Church’s blessings to Filipinos to accept bribe money from politicians on one hand and then, on the other, states that “you are not obliged to fulfil an immoral [and/or] illegal contract”. This is in direct contradiction with a basic tenet of just about every modern liberal society on the planet; that the law applies to all — not only the rich, not only the poor but to all.
Villegas caps his video with this astoundingly crazy bit of logic:
Choose God, not the candidate who wants to insult you by buying your vote and saying to you, “may presyo ka, alam ko kung magkano ka” (“you have a price and I know what your price is”). Isagot mo sa kanya, ang presyo ko ay ang katawan at dugo ni Kristo (“Answer that person, my price is the body and blood of Christ”). I am priceless.
It is evident that the only people really insulting Filipinos here are Leni Robredo’s supporters and none other than the country’s top Roman Catholic official. They would rather believe their own lies and the perverse logic they invoke to prop up those lies than respect their own country’s election laws. Worst of all, they are dragging into their crooked politics no less than the mighty Roman Catholic Church which, to be fair, has long been complicit in keeping Filipino minds so addled by nonsensical dogma as to be completely susceptible to their politicians’ toxic influence. Communist senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares sums up the so-called “pro-poor” philosophy that is at the core of this bizarre culture saying in a tweet (translated by this writer), “let us not pass the burden [of accountability] to the voters because, to begin with, they should not be offered money during elections.”
This habitual absolving of people of any personal accountability just because they are poor is at the root of why the Philippines remains an impoverished country today. To people like Villegas, Colmenares, and Robredo, there is always a higher power to blame for the poor fortunes of ordinary Filipinos — essentially assuring members of their flock that they are under no obligation to uphold what is right and own up to what is wrong because they are powerless in the grand scheme of things either way. This is absolute loser mentality that Filipino Opposition “thought leaders” are propagating — far worse than the “fake news” they keep screeching about (perhaps to distract us from their own idiocy).
One can only imagine the sort of messed up society the Yellowtards, the communists, and their henchmen in the Roman Catholic Church would oversee if given the reins of power. Oh wait, we’ve already seen their handiwork. It’s been on exhibit in all its prayerful glory over the three decades post-2016!",Others
